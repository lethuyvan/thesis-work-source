You had the 1 or the 2? Can't be more noisy than a jet helmet?

Anyway, RAD offers test drives with their helmet so I'm going to take a few for a spin. Any suggestions? Budget would be around 250 max.

>  If you're in the market for something cafe-racery that doesn't vibrate, i guess go for a bonneville?

From everything I've test driven I found the Triumph Street Twin to be the best. And personally, I find it the best looking as well so it will be hard for any bike to match that. Maybe the R NineT but that's not for my wallet. Definitely going to take that one for a spin though. 
It was a new experience and I wasn't used to it. The Kawa doesn't vibrate unless I really rev it in high numbers, the Street Twin does not vibrate, and IIRC the Harley did not vibrate that much either.

It actually kinda bothered me. Maybe it's something you get used to, and I get the appeal of it because it does indeed "feel alive". But when I crawled back onto my Kawa after the ride it never felt so smooth.

I don't think it's for me. But I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. 
Yeah, I wouldn't know where to begin either. I like giving my wife all the attention, using every "tool" at my disposal. Wouldn't know where to put it all when you have two persons to deal with.

I guess it could be kinda fun experimenting with someone who hasn't done it before as well. But immediately going at it with some with more threesome experience is going to be awkward I think.

I told my wife this subject came up on reddit again. "Yeah, well. You know it would probably screw me up emotionally, sorry for you."

Oh well...
Pearl and Hans Anders are real opticians though, I've never had a bad result with them. Not everyone who works there is one, but they have at least 1 person with the proper diploma working there.
I'm not good at write-ups, not even in Dutch. But anyway: I just came back from my test drive with the Moto Guzzi V7 III (Carbon). This particular one had non-standard pipes which are way too loud for my taste. I like the looks of the V7 much more with the regular ol' Stone edition without much ado. The Carbon does not look very AUTHENTICC 👌

The first thing I noticed (except for the obnoxiously loud pipes) were the vibrations. I thought my Kawa vibrated badly at times but this could make my wife have a REALLY good time ifyouknowwhatImean.jpg ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) No matter what RPM I was driving in.

The friendly lady took the lead (no solo test rides here) and we went for a half hour ride. The ride itself was very smooth, it handled really great and everything about the clutch and gas throttle felt natural. Steering was smooth as well. When opening the throttle when idle it pulled pretty hard to the right but not when riding. Speed bumps were a bit less fun though. Could be the Carbon edition, but the suspension felt pretty hard.

I liked the riding position. Nice and upright, felt natural. All in all it is a pretty fun bike to ride with. But the vibrations bother me way to much to ever consider it seriously.

Also, I need a new helmet. This Nolan N40.5 Jet Helmet is nice and all, but on the highway it catches wind like crazy and I really start to feel it in my neck after a while. Have my eyes set on a Shark Skwal 2.

You need a REALLY solid relationship for that, and both of you can not be jealous in the slightest. My wife and I discussed the subject a few times and she admits she is way to jealous for that. It would probably fuck her up emotionally, so that's (unfortunately maybe) a no for me.

> Imho, I think the rules surrounding it should be laws, like the speed differential stuff, maybe an upper limit too. 

This is one thing I like about Belgian traffic laws. Lane splitting is legally allowed, but bound to a set of rules:

- Only when the rest of the traffic is going less than 50km/h.
- The speed difference should not be more than 20km/h. So if the traffic around you is going 10km/h, you can only split at 30km/h.
- Maximum speed is 50km/h. So when traffic around you is moving at 40km/h you can only go 50km/h.
- Only between the two left-most lanes.

Is it also illegal for cars to consciously obstruct you while you are doing it.

All of this makes very good sense imho. 
> Also loads of children do this do ethical implications etc 

So people need to raise their kids and keep an eye on what they are doing, who would have known.

If your kid has access to real money to buy lootboxes you're doing it wrong.

> Om als kansspel geoormerkt te worden, moeten vier voorwaarden vervuld zijn: het moet gaan om een spel, met een bepaalde inzet, dat leidt tot winst of verlies voor de speler en waarbij het toeval speelt.

So... None of these games apply. You never lose with lootboxes. You know that you have a certain chance of getting item X or item Y but you always get something in return. You never lose money, compared to actual gambling.

I'm not joking, by their definition Eendjes Vissen literally is gambling as well.

Very similar situation: 650 apartment and 1500-2000 net income per person per month. Now is the time to start saving for that dream house. Try to live from one wage and put the other on your savings account every month. This should be very doable and will result in 50-70k at the end of the three year ride.

This doesn't mean you should live as "kluizenaars" though. Enjoy life, but with moderation. Be mindful of where you shop (Colruyt for example is great for bulk items and frozen foods). Be sure to shop around for your energy provider and try to talk your internet provider into a discount (which is usually already the case for new costumers).
Enjoying a beer in itself is not a an issue. "Needing" that beer at the end of a long day, or not being able to enjoy your diner with a glass of wine in my opinion is.

+1. It suggested a pretty nice detour (15km) from my usual (12km) commute to work. I used it a few other times as well to randomly ride around me and it has always come up with pretty nice roads. I purchased the Pro app to get turn-by-turn navigation as well, which works great. 
Kinda the same here with the divorce. Both me and my mom tried our best to help him in any way possible. But the family who choose my father's side and didn't know my mom's part of the story of course blamed her for not supporting her husband enough.

Over the years you get pretty tired of being supportive without results and I ended up breaking all contact with my father after one final fight where I said that "he will never see me get married or have children because he would be dead by then if he didn't change his lifestyle". That was the last thing I ever said to him. It would be funny if it weren't so sad.

Als tore the family apart. The funeral was an absolute shitshow I do not wish to anyone. Some of the family members showed their true colours that day and I never spoke to them again though, so there's that. Made our wedding a bit cheaper.

It was pretty uncanny, yeah. With those huge-ass hands. But still a fun show to watch IIRC.
My father literally drank himself to death. Not internet-literally, but literally-literally. Last time I saw him it was his bloated and yellow corpse on intensive care. Alcohol was the reason of him being fired, alcohol was the reason of the divorce, and alcohol was the reason of him losing his house and getting himself in serious debt.

For years we tried helping him, but when nearly everyone around you feels that "a few beers a day don't matter", even some psychiatrists, it's basically a David vs Goliath story.

I fucking hate how we collectively feel about alcohol. I absolutely despise people who get so shit-faced drunk they end up in hospital. I genuinely hate people who think that "one or two beers are ok when driving". I think people who feel like they "have to drink on social occasions" are fucking idiots. And I would rather no longer hang out with people who look at my wrong for ordering a cola at a bar.

It is a hard drug and banning it altogether is downright impossible. But what we maybe, hopefully, can achieve one day is a change in collective mindset. It happened with smoking, it can happen with alcohol as well.
Nah, they already do that while driving.
None. I hate sauce in nearly every shape and form.

Not sure what you're getting at here.
Lets look at it this way, "een vriend uit het Antwerpse" administered something to this child, very likely without consulting her actual doctor and without knowing what effect it could have on the long term. Why is it legal in The Netherlands but illegal here? I don't know, but I'm sure there's a reason other than evil Maggie and Bartje's war on drugs.

Turns out that if I shoot cocaine up my eye balls it relieves my horrible back pain. Should all blame fall on Maggie if I get jailed for the possession of an illegal drug, despite it saving my life?
Yeah, tell me about it. Bare minimum with zero options is like 12k already? I don't think so. That will buy me a very nice Triumph T120.
Every Belgian newspaper is the same, indeed. DS and DM use clickbait as well but imo HLN really takes the cake. 
That title, god fucking damned HLN.

I don't get it. Everyone here hates HLN, and for good reason. Yet the majority of articles being posted here come from HLN and they're always either clickbait or sensationalized. 

That said, I'm sure she's not the only one with this illness? How do other Belgians deal with this?

> Een vriend uit het Antwerpse heeft zich erin verdiept en het resultaat is verbluffend

Not even a doctor but just "some friend" and self experimentation. K then. There is no story. If they were legally given the drug and our government would suddenly change opinions about it and then confiscate it they would have a story. But no, the girl's parents knew very well what they were dealing with and they knew the legality of it. Yet they choose to continue anyway and now they reap what they have sown. Then of course HLN is very willing to publish a poor sob story with a sensationalized title and portray it as "our government LITERALLY killed this little girl!"
There is nothing more mainstream than hating on modern television right now though. 
How did you know? 
Lucky. I'm picking mine back up tonight but I have no idea how much it will set me back. They were waiting for the delivery of a new clutch cable, so that's definitely replaced. Hopefully they didn't decide to replace my entire transmission box as well or something.

So if you don't have the opportunity to work from home you're pretty much fucked into taking a day off.
Ha. Mine is in the garage for that EXACT problem (well, sorta). At one time I couldn't get it into neutral anymore either, no matter how hard I pushed the foot lever. I ended up pulling over (because OF COURSE it happened in traffic at a red light) and manually pushed my clutch cable a little bit into the lever which "resolved" it.

Back from holiday. Fuck that. Just when I rediscovered Stellaris. Yesterday was the first time I played since version 2.0.
Dropped mine off at the garage on Thursday for a maintenance before the big Zeeland-rit. I don't want to blow up my gearbox because it's acting funnier every ride. (Holding the lever all the way still makes the bike want to take off, which is bloody annoying at red lights.) Better have it fixed now before it gets worse. And since it has 28k km now I might as well have the 30k maintenance done while it's in.

I did think I would have it back on Saturday though, but no game. Maybe today.

Literally every single one of them "knows someone who have been killed in a car crash if they were wearing their seatbelts at that time!"

I had the displeasure of riding shotgun with someone who refused to wear their seatbelt. When we started driving, the car started beeping like crazy. "Don't worry, the beeping will stop in 2 minutes." God damned, just wear your fucking seatbelt. "I don't like the feeling."

I bet you'll like the feeling of getting sprayed over the asphalt a bit less honestly.

Just to chime in: I've got Kurviger Pro as well and I'm really digging it. I select the "extra curvy" option with no highways, no main roads, etc. and despite my very short commute to work (12km best path) it actually plotted me something very nice. I like the random road trip generator as well.

It doesn't look at traffic at all though, so if you need to be somewhere fast just stick to Waze.

Damn, 1:30 hour drive just to get to the starting point, and a one hour drive back home. I'll check with the wife. 

Edit: Put me down as probably/very likely.
It absolutely does.
/uj Nope, it's one of my favorites as well. It could get repetitive, sure. But I loved the atmosphere and the graphics were very nice at the time. It even ran great on my older computer.

Using guns until they literally exploded in your hands was an absolute blast. Failing rocket launchers were hilarious. 
DNS blocks still work I presume?
Why would you ever want to send an SMS over the internet, via a server you don't necessarily trust?
Even faster is visiting one of their offices. I visited their office in Antwerp and literally walked out 10 minutes later with a temporary green card. 
Ducati Monster and KTM Superduke spotted on the motorcycle parking this morning. Damn, shiny AF, especially that Ducati. 
Same situation here: Bike is my only personal vehicle due to company car and my wife sold her car recently. I have compared nearly all of them and found that, for me, Touring was the absolute cheapest.

I now pay 315 euro for BA for one year. Everyone else was at least double of that.
I think so too. The facade my look great with fancy apps and a nice web UI but I bet at least half the banks out there have a back-end that's built on fixes and workarounds.  
Here's what probably happened:

IT said that this is a horrible, horrible idea but management would not listen because "nonsense, what could go wrong."


Anyway, I was able to check my balance this morning and it looks like my overschrijvingen went all through as well.
Last working day before my week long holiday, yeah. Looks like the weather is going to be pretty nice as well.

CCNA Security first probably.
People ~~under~~ over 12 unironically like Boef? Literally all his songs about how he is better than everyone else and making money. I'm glad he turned out to be a POS irl as well so they stopped playing him.

Anyway, passed my Cisco CCNA yay.
En terecht.
Imo, facebook does indeed not have security issues. This entire "scandal" is a big media shitstorm about nothing. Can't "leak" anything if you willingly put it all up.

Still waiting for those numbers about Argenta being an insecure prutsbank though.
You can't compare the scale of Facebook and Google to a "kleinbank". Shit happens. But that does not mean that their back-end security is compromised.
That's not how IT works.
> As I get older I fear more and more for my hearing

PSA: Use earplugs, no matter your age! People have killed themselves for less because the tinitus drove them crazy. I feel MUCH more comfortable wearing earplugs. The difference is night and day.

That said, I already had custom molded earplugs for going to concerts. I just replaced the music filters with motorcycles filters from [these guys](https://www.crescendo-hearingprotection.com/) (based in The Netherlands, so shipping cost and time may vary greatly) and they work great. Still allow me to hear traffic and (presumably, have not tested it myself) music and voices but severely dampens wind and engine noise.

Custom made earplugs set me back about 150 euro but the insurance paid some of that back. This is without a doubt the best and most comfortable you can get. I haven't regretted making that purchase for an instant.
Phishing mails have absolutely nothing to do with the internal security of a bank.
Argenta gave us the best rates and conditions on our mortgage of every bank out there. I know a lot of my peers are with Argenta as well so from personal experience I really can't confirm this.

How fucking far-fetched can it get? Newsflash to all special snowflakes out there: Colonialism was real. Ignoring the "bad word" doesn't make it go away suddenly. Instead, use it as an opportunity to learn the mistakes of our past. But no, putting your fingers in your ears and confining yourself to a hugbox is MUCH better!

The past few days have been the opposite in Belgium. Every morning I listen to the weather report and they're like "Damn son, it's going to rain today! But like INSANELY hard! Lots of rain, bro! Even a thunderstorm that's brewing right now! It's going to hit you pretty hard."

And I'm like, "oh shit. I better not take the bike today then."

Exactly. It's not your employers business what your private life looks like. Mentioning this opens the door for discrimination, as proven in this research.

This basically. Bringing them to the containerpark would cost money, and one pallet is not enough to sell. So I figured since we've got a ton of room in our crawling space, why not just store them there "just in case". 

If I get in my midlife crisis I can also build a brick barbecue out of them.

Well, you can't assume anything about some else's environment. I agree that 30GB in today's world is next to nothing yet we only get 200GB for our remote site's DPs. Carrying some heavy software, not to mention all the Windows and Office updates doesn't leave very much room.

Anyway, thanks for the information. I tested my TS without stand-alone media and it did process the update steps correctly now.
God damned my legs. There was still a huge pallet of bricks in our garden from the previous owner. He lived there for two years but that pallet was never touched. This weekend we finally took that pile apart and stowed it in our crawling space underneath the house. I have never done so many squats in my life. Leg day sucks.

Last weekend we also had a guy come over to make an offer for paving our driveway. "Sure thing, today or tomorrow I'll e-mail it to you." Fast forward to today, well over one week later and we still haven't received anything. Calls go directly to voicemail. Typical.

And our cat Moesti went outside for the first time this weekend, that was fun to see. But now he won't stop whining at the door to go outside.

We indeed use the Stand-Alone Media wizard to create ISO files of the task sequence. We then ship that out so that our techs overseas can put that ISO on a USB drive and install the computers.

We can't use boot media because that would mean distributing 30+ GB to all 50 distribution points, which would definitely get the server team up my ass for hogging disk space as well as the network team for hogging bandwith.

So tl;dr: There is no way to run Software Updates in a stand-alone media task sequence? Despite there being network connectivity to the MP and DP? No hybrid solution for this?
What SSO tool have you deployed? We have deployed IBM Access Agent a while back and it's complete and utter shit. We are thinking about abandoning it completely due to the sheer amount of negative feedback. Unfortunately there are a handful of people who can't live without it now of course.

Not immediately after, but before the updates. Will try to put an additional reboot there. 
We're a big international company and we receive lots of complaints that users immediately have to deal with a bunch of updates on their brand new computers so it would actually be great if I could just update them during installation. Distributing new TS media every month is not feasible for us. Lots of overseas sites with slow WANs.  We don't care much for TS time, because our engineers just insert the USB stick, press enter and let it run overnight. 
I'm using USB media in this case, so the TS is not deployed to any collection.
Updates are set to all available, the updates are deployed to the unknown computer collection with a "as soon as possible" deadline. 
I increased the SMSTSSoftwareUpdateScanTimeout to one hour so that should be plenty of time. Logs don't seem to indicate a timeout either.

Exactly. Regular teachers aren't trained to deal with kids like that, yet they force those children to be in regular schools. Due to lack of resources, this usually either drags the whole class down or the child in question doesn't receive the necessary care and they trickle down to special needs schools anyway.

Als je niet omkan met "de willekeur van de school" moet je helaas ook geen kinderen nemen. Pedagogische studiedagen hebben er altijd al bijgehoord. Een groot deel van de bevolking moet zich ook aanpassen aan de willekeur van de vakbonden als ze nog eens besluiten om te staken.

> Sure, it's not the most cosy of supermarket

I absolutely loathe shopping at Colruyt. The layout of their store doesn't make any sense to me either and I find it downright enervating to shop there.

But indeed, they have good deals. We buy nearly all our frozen goods there. I don't really like their meat though, that I still prefer from Delhaize. 
We have already established that the employer in this case is in fact a bad person. So yes, I am definitely going to assume he is going to make his employee's work a living hell for getting the union involved.

We tried potato gratin from Everyday (Colruyt) recently. Damn, that was good.
Where do you think I am now?
Why were you fired?

\- Because I refused to work overtime in't zwart.


In that particular scenario: What happened next? Do you really want to continue working for the same employer, because you just know he's going to make your work life a living hell.
Forgot my badge again. The nice lady at the reception even remembered my name from last time (2 weeks ago) and it's not a common name so... I should either be flattered or insulted.

As she prepared my badge I asked what happened to the last two receptionists, since I hadn't seen them for a while. "Oh, they both got fired." I'm expecting a great story in here somewhere but I didn't ask further.

ELI5: When astronomers look at exoplanets and investigate whether or not they could support life they always look at our own conditions. I.e: Carbon-based life that needs water and air. Is it so implausible that there are other elements-based lifeforms out there that may need completely different sets of conditions to support life? Maybe they're looking at Earth and are saying "Water? Air? No way that planet can support life."

What I don't get: They have announced they will be doing something illegal. Blocking roads is not legal. And all the police can do is say to avoid Brussels?

Seriously though, I hope a lot of PVs will be written if they decide to go through with blocking roads.

Going to say the same thing I said last year: Motorcyclists, watch the fuck out. You are not invincible.

I went for a ride myself yesterday and I saw not one, not two, but three motorcyclists who were acting downright dangerous. Don't. Just don't. 
Lots of decent riders too though, keep it up.

But yeah, car drivers: Please watch out for my ass, thx.
Damn, what a nice weekend. Went on a pretty long drive this Sunday but unfortunately I don't really know any "picturesque" or motorcycle-friendly roads around me. Are there any good websites for that? I already put my Waze on "motorcycle mode" but that obviously still gives me the fastest route to my destination. I don't want that, I want the nicest route.

Oh well. One of these days a manager's computer will lock out and the key will not be backed up.
I'm currently in a team of three handling everything desktop-related. However: One of us in the antivirus specialist (McAfee is just a pain in the ass product you really need someone who has received training in order to find their way through the clusterfuck that is EPO). The other is balls deep in carve-out projects and Office 365 with MDM migrations. I am working on the Windows 10 roll-out project, having to maintain several golden images and making sure it works for every business unit. Just got another request because we suddenly need LTSB for a handful of computers.

That leaves very little time for our ticket queue which fills faster than we can resolve. I once dedicated two days cleaning that mess up (went from 118 to just under 20). One workweek later we were back up at 90+.

People have the right to defend Uber just as much as you have the right to put the blame on Uber. An accident happened and that's a fact.

Uber is one of the pioneers of self-driving vehicles. One of them is bound to make mistakes in the process. Now it's time to learn from it and move on.

This women's death will prevent the death of many others unless we stop all development towards self-driving vehicles right now and just assume humans are better at it (spoiler: they're not.)
You are really the only one who keeps insisting on the "visible light" argument. The comment Fanta linked does not contain that whatsoever.

That pedestrian should have looked before crossing a major road. There's no excuse.

Computers are not perfect and accidents will still happen but they are much, much, much less likely to happen. 
No it's not. The basis for that argument is basic math and physics.
I absolutely hate it when one accident happens with a self-driving car and people are immediately all up in arms "SEE!!!! SEE HOW DANGEROUS THOSE THINGS ARE!!!!!!1" completely ignoring the fact that literally thousands of people die every day in traffic because of human error.

It appears that my rain pants have a small leak. Right next to my crotch. So now it looked like I pissed my pants. GREAT!

Update on old laptop dude. He called me yesterday evening to not-so-subtly-but-thinking-it-was-subtle ask me when it would be done "because you know, you need a computer and you kinda miss it when you don't have one."

Dude, it's been 2 fucking days... It will be done when it's done. Besides, the only thing he does is surfing dating sites and e-mailing from an account that no longer exists. That's right. I found out he had an Outlook setup on his old computer with a Skynet address. The login credentials no longer work and the last e-mail received was somewhere in 2011 but his outbox is filled to the brim with unsent mails up until 2017...

Of course, literally every e-mail is a powerpoint presentation. Why do old people love sharing powerpoints so much? Are it the DANK MEMES of the older generation perhaps? It's also either a dumb joke or soft porn. No exceptions. For example the e-mail titled "FW:RE:Doorst:Doorst:FW:Vanaf Nu Ga Ik Elke Dag Bowlingen!". I thought "It's going to be a powerpoint with either pictures or a video of naked women bowling."

Spot on. It was exactly that.

Nice list. Saved.
Buying from a dealer: More certainty that the motorcycle is properly maintained, but for a higher price.

Buying from a private person: Make sure you do a lot of research and know what to look for in the particular motorcycle you are going to look at.

If you arrive and the engine is warm, walk away immediately. Make sure you go for a (short) test drive. Bring a flashlight. The owner should also be able to tell where every little scratch and dent came from. Mine for example has a pretty big scratch on the right-hand side and the owner immediately pointed that out and told me how it got there (dropped it on a grindparking) even before I saw it.

I bought mine from a private person but checked with a Kawasaki dealer beforehand so I knew what to look for. Also did a lot of googling on "buying second hand motorcycle" which gave lots of good tips as well. 
And then they act surprised why young people don't watch regular TV anymore. When I was with the old dude for his laptop (rant from yesterday's thread) his TV was on and he started complaining about the ads. "Urgh, I've seen this one a million times already."

When I told him that's one of the main reasons we don't have a cable subscription at home he acted like I was some weird outer space alien or a caveman. "WHAT?! No TV?"

> only to see them go to someone else completly disregarding everything I say

Been there as well. A 40-something year old guy wanted a notebook but it had to be very decent because he would be using it professional for his job. This was back when Windows 8 had just released and it was a total mess and confusing AF for new users. So I suggested a notebook with Windows 7 Pro.

He of course completely disregarded that, went to Vanden Borre and picked up the cheapest notebook he could find. Windows 8 Home of course. Then he was pretty bummed out about the fact it was "confusing" and he "couldn't work with it."

Didn't care, presented him the bill and he didn't even pay. In the end it was his fucking girlfriend that was so ashamed of him that she ended up paying me in the end. I don't think she ever got that money back either (they are no longer together).
What did I miss?

Bonus question: "Hoe surft ge het op het internet? Met de blauwe E, of de gekleurde strandbal?"
I don't get why I keep helping old people who are "friends of friends" with their computers.

Last week I was helping someone with their computer. A dude in his 60'ies. "Just to have a look at it. See what could improve." The laptop in question was an (at least) 10 years old Compaq with 1GB running Windows Vista... To be fair there was not much wrong with it, besides being EXTREMELY slow of course. Memory was constantly at 100%, the disk was reading like crazy. Opening the browser took 20 minutes.

I just said to him, honestly there is not much to do about this. This notebook is extremely old and nothing is going to fix that. He asked what a new one would cost so I recommended him a simple 400 euro HP. Pretty decent specs (AMD A6, 8GB DDR4, 128GB SSD) for the price but plastic AF and bloated with crapware which took me a while to get uninstalled all.

Anyway, yesterday I went over to him again to pick up his old notebook so I could transfer all his data in piece and quiet at home. I just needed some information, the most important one being "how do you read your e-mail?"

I had already prepared myself for the dread of this question because I haven't met a single old person who was able to answer that question coherently. As expected, I was met with a blank stare...

Me: "How do you read your e-mail? What to do you when you want to read mails?"

Him: "Oh, my e-mail.. I.. euhm...Well I..."

Me: "Do you have e-mail? Do you read mails sometimes?"

Him: "Haha, why of course I do! What else would I use my computer for?"

Me: "Ok, what is your e-mailaddress?"

Him: "I don't know that."

Me: "Is it a Gmail, a Telenet, a Proximus, an Outlook maybe,..."

Him: Blank Stare

Me: "Ok, show me what you do on your computer if you want to read e-mail."

Him: Start tapping with his finger on the screen like a madman. "I open the euh.. You know, this one". Pointing in the general direction of IE.

Me: "Ok, just show me. Do it."

Him: Proceeds to open IE. Goes to google. Googles "google". Clicks on the first link. Types in "g-mail". And that's how I do it!

Me: "No, now you've just Googled for gmail. We're not seeing any e-mails yet are we?" I click on the first gmail result to open Gmail. We are presented with a login screen. "Ok, do you know your login?"

Him: "My what now?"

Me: "Well, you are not logged in to Gmail right now. In order to read your e-mails you need to log in. Do you know your email address and password?"

Him: "No."

Me: "Then it will be pretty impossible to setup your e-mail, no? You said you read e-mail, then how do you log in? You must have a password to your e-mail account somewhere?"

Him: "I don't know, maybe it's something like Janneke or Jeannetje or something like that."

Me: "OK, I'm going to take your old notebook. Setup your new one at home and I'll deliver it in a few days. In the meantime, please make sure you have your e-mail address and password so I can setup your e-mail in a few days."

Him: "Oh, sure. Certainly."

... I don't charge enough for this shit. Not by a long shot.

It was their [Final March](https://imp.imagekit.io/impericon/cms/tour-of-the-year-2017/toty_header.jpg) tour, but they used the [Passage of the Crane](http://outroar.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Heaven-Shall-Burn-Passage-of-the-Crane-2017-Flyer.jpg) tifo which imo looks super bad-ass.

Of course, the filters are interchangeable... Thanks for the tip, will check with Aurilis. 
There's no denying that. But a lot of employees feel like they earn a raise because they suddenly have a loan to pay off. The employer doesn't and shouldn't give anything about that. That's an external factor that has nothing to do with your work.

As I was standing in the AB yesterday, headbanging to Heaven Shall Burn I realised something. "Wait a minute... I have custom made earplugs already! Why buy another set of motorcycle earplugs?"

Of course, I'm not sure if earplugs specifically designed for music work just as well to filter out the wind noise but it's definitely worth the try.

*Edit: Aurilis could sell me "full block" filters for my custom earplugs for 50 euro. I found the exact same filter they suggested online for 10 euro, and even motorcycle specific filters for 15 euro. Ordered.

Your external financial obligations are not the business of your employer though, so that's a non-argument for them.

Was also pleasantly surprised by Whitechapel. I'm usually not a big fan of the grunting death metal with the occasional pig squeal but this was actually pretty nice. 
> It's plain ridiculous to drive 120 kph on an empty highway at late evening/ night

Absolutely agree. I did Brussel - Antwerp over the E19 yesterday at 11:30. You could easily and safely do 140.

But as long as those plates say "120" that's the speed I'm going to drive. And if everyone is driving at that speed and you are the one idiot going way faster than everybody else you are a danger to others and yourself. Don't speed. No matter how ridiculous you may think it is. This is not about you.

In reality, I think very few people are going for the "cash for car". As a colleague of mine stated today: I have a car that's worth 50k, are they going to pay me 50k over the 4 year life span of that car? I don't think so.

However, the mobility budget sounds very interesting. I'm currently driving a VW Golf as company car and could probably get a VW Passat in two years. I would very gladly stay with the Golf if that means I can have budget for an electric bicycle or public transport subscription.

The Human Rights conventions are written down somewhere, no?

Of course it's a horrible idea and won't work in reality. I'm not calling for vigilante justice either.

Why is to so damn hard to find something good for our driveway?

We originally wanted Belgian Bluestone, but since we're not made out of money we saw a Vietnamese variant we really liked. Too bad! Not available as a driveway stone because it's not thick enough. And no-one else seems to have it. Our in-laws forwarded us to a dealer who did replica stones in concrete. Lots of decent stuff there, but not really 100% what we want. They are now heavily pushing us towards "gepolierd beton" but we don't want that. That can be very good looking, but imho only when you have one of those ULTRA modern huge ass villas, not for a simple half-open house with dark red face bricks.

My wife is a teacher. It's not rare that these kids 12 years and younger suddenly take out a can of Monster during lunch. Or even better: Energy drink in their drinking flask. You smell that from a mile away. When you confront the parents they honestly don't give a shit. 
When I go out with my wife and it's just the two of us we sit opposite to each other because that makes sense in that situation. But when we're with friends we always sit next to each other. It makes it easier to converse with the people you're going out with.

But I personally prefer sitting next to her though.
Not sure where you are located exactly, but I can highly recommend [Apex](https://www.demotorrijschool.be/). They are by far the cheapest I found (960 euro all-in) and the teacher I had (Dave) was a super chill and friendly guy. I had never in my life sat on a motorcycle or even a scooter. I had no idea how to switch gears but I managed to get my license from the first time.

But yeah, it's still expensive. You can lend a helmet and gloves from the school (if you don't mind a horrid sweat smell) but you still need your own pants, shoes and vests of course.

By choosing a highly controversial artist to make the Official WK song they are associating our national soccer team with a sexist. They should have asked themselves: Do we really want to advertise our team to the world like that? They could have given it some more thought. 
None of them are linked to our national football team for an international event though. 
Maybe Coely is an actually legit artist that doesn't want to stoop so low to be associated with the Red Devils theme song? 

This is like the "Michelle Obama for president!!" debacle. Has anyone asked them if they *want* to?
Of course it is. (Not being ironic here, I know it's subjective).
Aah, Luminus. Worst fucking energy company I ever had the displeasure of dealing with.

We had Luminus in our apartment because they were the cheapest for us at the time. When we knew we were going to move we contacted them to have our contract cancelled on January 31.

Somewhere in the middle of February I noticed that their SEPA thingy was still active and was about to withdraw money from my account. I blocked that transaction and contacted them. "Oh, I see your contract is still active! Shall we cancel it now?" Yes, of course! And you know what's funny? They had the contact details of the new owner already, so my cancel/transfer request did in fact got through, it just wasn't executed yet.

A few weeks later we got our final bill "0 euro". That's weird, it can't be a coincidence that this would be exactly 0 euro, but whatever. A bit later, an invoice in the mailbox: "Hey, you still owe us 40-something euro!"

I called them to ask what's up and out came a weird explanation about the SEPA being blocked, and the final bill being calculated on the assumption that is wasn't blocked, blablabla. Whatever. I just paid it.

Earlier this week, another invoice: "You blocked our SEPA. Please pay us 8 euro." WHAT THE DICKENS? I had to call their (not free by the way) service desk again to ask where that 8 euro came from because the agent last time confirmed me that when I payed the final bill everything would be OK. Again, some weird explanation about the SEPA being blocked and this amount being still open. I persisted and said that's impossible because I payed everything. "Oh, ok. In that case I'm going to credit the 8 euro and you're off."

Never again, thank you very much.
> Edit : where did you get your house loans ?

In general, the bank where your parents/close family have savings accounts and insurances can offer you the best percentage. However, that percentage does not paint the whole picture. Your life- and fire-insurance will very likely be mandatory and that can differ hugely between banks. One bank was able to give us a better percentage than Argenta, but their insurances were 4 times as expensive...

If you have absolutely no brand loyalty towards any bank you can contact an Immotheker and Hypotheekwinkel and they should be able to give you a very good deal as well. 

In the end we went with Argenta for a number of reasons. They gave us a VERY good percentage with good conditions because both my wife's as my parents had accounts there. Their banking accounts and VISA cards are free, and their insurances are (compared to the other banks we visited) on of the cheapest on the market. That, and we felt really comfortable with the banker who worked there. She was extremely friendly and helpful in every way from the start.

I survived my first ride in the rain! TIL: Leather is not waterproof. Kevlar jeans are not waterproof. My gloves and shoes are waterproof to some degree. 

People behave MUCH more like assholes when it rains. Was going past a traffic jam that was going about 20km/h, lots of room for me to safely pass. Until I passed a big black BMW. OH BOI, he did NOT like me passing him. After a honking tirade he started very aggressively driving a mere few centimeters distance right next to me. No chance for me to get in front of him so I backed off and started driving behind him. What an absolute fucking subhuman twat. I would have loved to ask him what his problem was at the next light but he turned in a street early.

Also, is it normal that my bike starts smoking like crazy in the rain? I guess it's the water evaporating off the hot parts because it doesn't do that in dry weather. Smells a bit funny too.

For certain items, like for example everything motorcycle-related, I visit my local shops because then I can talk to the people and get feedback and information. More expensive than buying online, but I don't mind paying extra for the extra service.

On the other hand, things like gifts or items I need no explanation about: Whichever webshop is cheapest. Be it bol.com, coolblue, or amazon.de.

I had that happen once. Was driving in a zone 30 street, stopped at a pedestrian crossing to let the people cross and the BMW driver tried to overtake me only to just in time slam the brakes when he saw the pedestrians. I looked at him with the utmost disgust and he gazed back with the most pretentious face ever, as if I was to blame...

Playing Kerbal, I know how hard this must have been. I'm proud, OP.
On a global scale you may be right. But those wars probably would have been fought without religion anyway. Humans find a way.

Looking at a more local scale: What about all those people who re-found themselves in God or their religion and decided to give back to the community? Help others in need because at their own darkest times it was religion that helped them pull through. Religion is much more than believing in rijstpap in heaven. 
How is OP riding like a dick? Not speeding or anything. 
Citation needed.
> through the whole process of religious indoctrination.

Tbf, I was never "indoctrinated" in any way. What's there to indoctrinate with? "Love thy neighbor?" 
Religion is not about the "truth", that's kinda the definition: Believing in something. That however does not mean you can't believe in any scientific truths just because you believe in a Deity or the values that religion is based on.
And it objectively has to do with religion as well. I have no numbers on this, but I'm pretty sure there very few people actually baptizing their children for purely religious reasons.
From personal experience: You have fun with your friends and at the same time learn and discuss the Christian values like the ten commandments. So yeah, it's definitely not invaluable or useless. 
The thing is though: To me it doesn't feel like "joining" an organization at all.
Then they can yiff with me down there.
Being with someone = compromise.
Not sure. I think it's the same
Albeit cringy, pretty harmless fun.
I feel pretty neutral towards the church tbh. No strong feelings one way or another.
That's a "concern" for me as well.
I distinctly remember having fun with my friends during my Eerste and Plechtige Communie.

But it's being replaced by the Lentefeest more and more, and I don't oppose that. 
That's true.

Then again, I'm baptized. Hasn't changed my life for better or worse and I don't feel the need to "unsubscribe" to anything. 
Still a bit "torn" about whether I should baptize my kids or not. On one hand, we aren't really religious so why bother. On the other hand, I feel like it's more tradition than religion at this point. My wife seems to oppose baptizing though, so we're probably not going to do it. We didn't marry for the church either.

Can you put /u/DeyjandiVonn in the center of attention today? Happy Birthday! 
Congratulations! 
Don't have any real guides I'm afraid. I used it for the first time YEARS ago for a high school assignment. Just trial and error until you get the hang of it.

It is hands down the best Exchange/O365 e-mail client there is and its main feature is exactly what you are looking for: Instead of locking down your entire phone with a PIN (if your company forces that on you) you can just lock down the app with a PIN and it's all good. It will not alter anything on your phone, every security feature lockdown is confined to the app itself.

It's pretty expensive for an app, but imo worth every cent. I think you can download it for free as a trial.
Ik moet just niks!

Besides, I don't eat much meat anyway.
StuBru's sole purpose is selling concert tickets. Example: Fall Out Boy in Vorst is coming up. StuBru NEVER plays FOB, ever. But they do now! Right after the commercial for FOB in Vorst. When that concert is over they will probably never play FOB again, unless they headline some major festival in a few years.
Sun? Positive temperatures? Glorious! 

Didn't spot too many fellow motorcyclists this morning yet though.
We were supposed to be planting a hedge this weekend. Couldn't stick the shovel any deeper than 2cm (me_irl) so I guess that's going to have to be postponed.

So instead we started brainstorming about what to do with our attic. We want to turn it into the master bedroom. "Sketchup to the rescue!" I thought. WTF happened to that software? The free version is no longer available as a standalone download. It's a cloud webapp running in a browser. Which sucks absolute balls because a browser is nowhere near powerful enough to do 3D rendering. Ok, maybe it is. It's probably just me but whenever I tried to raise a wall or something the tab kept freezing. Incredibly frustrating to work with. You also have to create an account to save your projects. Yeah, fuck that. They are probably wondering why people are illegally downloading the Pro version so much.

In other news, my left shoe creaks like crazy and I have no clue what causes it. I think it's something inside the sole so I can't get to it. Drives me up the wall.
Saw the same thing happen last time it snowed so heavily. Poor bastard with his 4 blinkers on, both feet on the ground and shuffling about 5km/h.

But to be honest, it wasn't unexpected. Every weather report and app said it was going to snow a day in advance. 
Is it me or do they look exactly the same?

I've honestly never saw a Miss Belgian who I found genuinely attractive. 
That's human nature for you. Especially when the same patterns emerge over, and over, and over again.  
They already have a dildo of the sea creature.
As I said elsewhere in this thread, I find that quote has very little nuance.

> 24/7 surveillance of anything and everyone everywhere on the off-chance that something does happen?

No-one is watching surveillance camera footage live. It's only used afterwards and if needed. Personally I feel the benefits outweight the "cost" immensely. 

> Personally, I much prefer having the freedom to do and go as I please without some Big Brother-esque system

The amount of freedom to do and go as you please does not change by the amount of cameras pointed on you in a public space, given that you didn't do any weird stuff publicly. Do you feel your privacy being invaded if some random people, who have no business with your life, see you walking on the street?

> Terrorists have won a long time ago.

I can only speak for myself here, but I'm not living my life in fear. Nor do I feel that I'm getting fucked by the government by "anti-terror" measurements. 
(I am in no way affiliated with deathbulge, I just like sexy reindeer with big juicy muscles.)

> I decide whom to share it with and whom not. Someone taking it without consent is a crime, didn't you know?

You are registered in your town hall with your name and address. They know who your parents, siblings, and children are and where they live. Does that bother you? Is that illegaly obtained information?

> So camera's in your house again to reduce taxes?

My house is not a public space, how many times? When I drive my car out in the open road that was built with tax-payer money, I am driving around in a public space. Difference.

> They know more about you, than you do. 

And I really, from the bottom of my heart, honest to God, don't care. It even fills in my tax letter for me, great.

> Democracy isn't there to remove civil liberties. 

Imo this does not remove or limit your liberties in any way. The government knows a shitton about you already. Does that hinder you in any way in your day to day life? Do you wake up in the morning thinking "man, the government is sure fucking me over right now knowing exactly where I live and how much I earn."

> "Those who want to give up some liberty for some security,, deserve neither."

A quote with absolutely zero nuance, nice.
> Why? What happens in your body is also private. Your body isn't a public space. Yet somehow it is entirely justified to you that I will be forced to give up my control over my genetic data? 

How do you "control" your genetic data right now?

> Farmaceutical companies would go bananas over such a database. Insurance companies would be so happy with that data.

By all means, let them have it! I'm all in favour of scientific research and I would gladly pay less taxes if some entry in some database says I live a healthy lifestyle. I would also welcome a black box in my car to prove I'm not a reckless driver it that would result in lower car insurance cost. In fact, put black boxes in everyone's car and auto-fine. Now THAT would be glorious!

> We can see from birth plenty of indicators for heightened risk for various diseases.

Here's the thing though: They're talking about taking your DNA and putting it in cold storage. Not running every existing test on it. And I wouldn't even oppose that. If they can track a life threatened disease of my children at birth I would be very glad they found that for me because of the "obligated" tests.

> Ah yes, because the government never used other things gained through such excuses for anything else. No sir, never happened before. A governmental power grab, perish the thought.

Colour me naive, but a stable Western EU country wich co-founded the UN? I'm going to go with: Very unlikely that would happen.

> Life insurance is a choice, RSZ is a coerced duty. Weird you always need to go to the private, not coerced sector for your arguement.

According to some tinfoil hatters, the government has had access to our landlines, our mobile phones, and our internet for years. What have they done with this information? Absolutely nothing. Nothing is suddenly going to change if they suddenly have some more data.

This is how such a database can and should be used imo: https://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/81do6j/nva_en_cdv_willen_uw_dna_in_databank_critici/dv2vv2v/?st=jeaclzi4&sh=fd3a04da

> Choices are not without consequences. With the state however, those consequences are fines, penalities and loss of civil rights: criminalization of you.

Yes. As it should? It's a democracy, if you don't like the policies vote for another party.

Honestly, some of you people talk as if a dictator is going to take control of Belgium overnight and use our DNA to frame us for murders.
You would much rather live in some sort of Wild West where everyone can just do as they please because "I don't need to answer to the government."?

I illegaly enter your home. Do you officially live there or do I? Who is lying?


This is an excellent implementation of the concept imo.
You people act like the world wouldn't step in if a country suddenly started rounding up all Jews and gay people. It's not 1938 anymore.
> the police usually visits your place before you register at the commune, check in your drawers to verify that you actually live there. Not all of them do it but it’s a right they take for granted (and people find normal)

How else are they going to verify you actually live there? This is to combat fraud, not the government trying to spy on why.

> a business that requires you to enter in a certain area can refuse to provide you service if you refuse to let them make an electronic copy of your ID (with your address and so on). Because safety & company rules.

You are free to not use their services if you don't like their EULA.


> I thought you had nothing to hide? Why suddenly hide somehting? So suspicious.

Contrary to popular belief, I do believe in the concept of "privacy". Not everything is black and white. What happens in my own house, behind closed doors, is private. Public spaces are not.

> Your body is?

If I give my DNA to the government, will you be able to see that? Is it suddenly public knowledge? Besides, there is no-one, literally no-one, even remotely interested in having a look at your or my genetic code. "The government" doesn't see a thing. It's cold data that's stored somewhere and could maybe only be dug up if your name comes up in a criminal investigation.

> Meneer, u hebt deze indicatoren de sociale zekerheid gaat u niet dekken. Je kan toch niet verwachten dat de samenleving boet voor uw genetica. Trouwens we moeten besparen en die huidkankers en longkankers waar u een aanleg voor hebt dat is gewoon te duur.

Yes, that's exactly how life insurance works. Smoker? Kidneys not working as they should? HIV positive? I'm sorry but that's going to be a hefty premie for you. Works both ways too though.

Meneer, volgens uw DNA bent u perfect gezond (as if they can see that in DNA taken at birth, but whatever). U kan zich niet aanmelden voor een invaliditeitsuitkering, niet proberen foefelen aub.

That said, they're not denying people anything now are they? Your example could very much already be in effect today but it's not. Because popular to contrary belief, the government is not there to screw you over. Social security is not suddenly going to dissappear because they have some additional data about you. 

> I can chose to either do or not do that, the government coerces me here. Quite the difference.

Not really. Don't want to do the tests? No loan or life insurance for you pal.
> Why not in your house? To prevent domestic abuse. I mean if you've got nothing to hide? /s

Yes, because LITERALLY everything about my opinion in privacy must be black and white!

My house is not a public space, don't be stupid.

> It can litterally tell you everything about my body and health? Why am I forced to share something so revealing with the government for no good reason. There is no reason to assume once the government has such valuable data it won't use it for anything else. (social security for starters)

They can spot genetic defects, not if you get overweight or have heart issues later in life. You insurance company on the other hand... No-one seems to mind having a full medical checkup, including urine and blood sample when they apply for a loan.
If I get mugged on the street, I would want that on tape. If my children get run over by a car and the driver commits hit and run, I would want that on tape. If someone gets carjacked, I would want that on tape. If someone commits or wants to commit a terrorist attack, I would want that on tape.

This really helps in quickly identifying and catching culprits. 
I honestly would not care. Au contraire. I'm in favour of cameras on literally every street corner. How does your DNA equals your privacy? Your sequence of genomes won't tell the government what porn you watch. 
I, for example, don't even know how to tighten the breaks on my bicycle. I tried it a few times but I always ended up making things worse.

With my motorcycle, the clutch is acting up a bit so I sat down with the service manual took a long and hard look at the pictures and said "Yeah, I'll just get it serviced soon." 

I am not a handy person in that regard. I check the tire pressure and lube the chain but that's about it. Then again, I've only had it for so long. I might actually learn how to do maintenance myself when the garage bills start coming in.

DAE LE PC MASTER RACE???? CONSOLE = POTATO AMIRITE?

No seriously, I play this thing via my Steam Link with my Steam Controller. And yes, absolutely: A mouse is way more precise for FPS situations, but Hitman is not really an FPS game. You can perfectly snipe with the controller, but controller a sniper in fast-paced action will prove difficult.

The PiHole does a lot of caching, so there is nearly no difference in latency. 

The Ubuntu server does pretty much nothing else but Plex and data storage.
Most people are like this. "Fuck religion! Oh, besides those buddhist monks of course. They are chill AF. And the ancient Romans had a pretty sweet religion as well, with all their gods and all. But srsly, fuck religion."
Your dutch is much better than my french. Kudos! 
AC is great. As I said, my gaming PC has a Netgear AC dongle and after I changed my IP addresses yesterday I did another speedtest: 208/21. I pay for 200/20 so.... These results are very consistent. I always get full speed.

On if my PIs is running PiHole, and thus plays DNS server/adblocker for the entire network. The other one is my downloader, which communicates with my Plex server and has Sonarr/Radarr running for series and movies grabbing. The Ubuntu server is my Plex server to which my in-laws have remote access as well. VPN is running on the router itself.

Overkill? Maybe a bit, but I'm definitely not the only one in my company. A colleague of mine even has redundant Plex servers with a load balancer because he frequently has like 8 people watching from it at once. Another one has UniFi access points in his house which is, if you ask me, absolute overkill as well but still cool to have. As far as homelabs go, mine is pretty modest.
JK Simmons was amazing in Whiplash. Great actor.
Such is the way of most people. 
A clip-on mic instead of a desk mic could fix that.
They're not even real subnets lol (muh broadcast domains!), everything is in the same /8. I just like my environment clean and cable as much as possible. And if it has a cable, why not have a DHCP reservation as well? The only wireless things really are my notebooks and phones. And PC unfortunately, because I can't be arsed to pull a cable to to other side of my house. Get my full 200/20Mbps over 5Ghz AC so why bother.

I could also use one of my Raspberries as DHCP server, but meh. I'll live with this setup. 
*Edith: Whoops, I though this was a reply to the post about my router. My bad. Yeah, "gaming" headsets tend to suck bad. 

Same here but when I bought it, it wasn't branded as such. You'll never see me buying their newest Nighthawk "gaming" switch, that's just ridiculous.

It was/is a very decent, and very reasonably priced AC router and does have a shitton of advanced features like VPN, VLAN, QoS, Dynamic IP, etc. etc. I like it, but that's the one annoying thing I found out about it yesterday.
R7000. Looked it up, doesn't allow it. The first three octets are effectively grayed out and putting .255 as the final address yields an "invalid range" error.
We were already living together so luckily had most of the basics.

New table incoming though, because our current one is pretty small and completely lost in our big kitchen. 
[Here](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/routing-information-protocol-rip/13788-3.html) is a Cisco guide I found about the subject of IP addressing and subnetting. Just the first link on Google though, I bet there are a lot more. (Quickly glancing over it, it seems they explain things in a pretty difficult manner.)

I'm currently studying for my Cisco CCNA certificate and I'm reading [Todd Lammle's book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119288282) for this. Very much overkill if you just want the basics, but everything is very thoroughly explained here. It's very interesting stuff imho, if you're into that. 
I don't use this setup myself because I hardly ever need a microphone: But most people seem to suggest a dedicated mic and decent headphones instead of those "gaming" headsets that break by looking at it wrong.
Haha, sounds like hell. I only have my summer leather jacket as well so I put a lot of layers underneath it last week. Luckily I bought winter gloves recently because those perforated summer ones would have probably killed me, even with heated grips.

Massive kudos to you, and congratulations on passing!
You have brought great shame to your family. 
> Slept terribly, as is tradition with first nights somewhere

Can confirm. The first night in our house we slept in the living room on our bedsofa. So many strange, new noises. And WAAY too hot because we didn't reprogram the thermostat yet so it kept going all night long. 

Moving is a bloody pain in the ass. And so is the administration. We moved 2 months ago and only yesterday realised that our water is still on the old owner's name.

But when you're finally settled in: GLORIOUS!
Mortsel: "Oh, dear. It's still freezing and it's most likely going to rain/snow later today. Better put a metric shitton of salt on the bicycle lanes in advance!"

Hoboken: "Great idea! We try to do everything we can to keep the commuters safe."

Wilrijk, their retarded nephew: "LOL? Salt is for fries not for roads!"

URGH, get you shit together Antwerpen. The EXACT same thing happened last time and you got a lot of negative comments about it. Do something!

In other news, my Netgear router is being funny AF. I'm redesigning the IP addressing scheme for my home network. Router is 10.0.0.1, servers are 10.1.0.x with fixed IPs, wired devices are 10.2.0.x with fixed IPs, and I wanted everything wireless (DHCP) be 10.3.0.x. 

NOPE! Despite setting the router's netmask to 255.0.0.0, the DHCP scope is fixed to 255.255.255.0, can't change that. So you can only use 10.0.0.2-10.0.0.254 as DHCP scope. Which is obviously enough for a home network, but it bugs me.
F
This is why I have an app on my phone. It says there is a chance of snow tomorrow, so I'm taking my bicycle just to be sure.
MUCH BETTER
Have an upvote because some people are salty AF and can't stand a joke.

Thanks, Theo!
Oh no, I don't bicycle naked.

Not anymore. Not since... The incident.

What do you think I am, some of kind of weird degenerate? 
So many schoolkids this morning without gloves on their bicycles trying to act though but actually dying inside. Hilarious. 
And I did it without thermal underwear! #REALMEN
-4? You pleb. I bicycled to work in -8. 

/r/gatekeeping
So many people were sharing and defending this on my facebook unironically, it was insane. 
There are tons of parking lots near the voetgangszone. From there it's 5 minutes, max.

But I do agree that Brussels is an absolute shithole to drive around in. Trix is great because it's easily reachable and has tons of free parking literally next door.
Long sleeved shirt, hoodie and my winter coat. Regular jeans and ski socks under my thick winter hiking shoes.

Also put on my motorcycle scarf, a fleece thingy around your neck with something to pull over your mouth. That was a nice to have.

Warmer, but rain though. I don't care much about the temperature as long as it's dry.
Who in their right mind thinks it's a good idea to put the heating that high when it's so cold out? Reminds me of the old trams in Antwerp. Those things are literal saunas when it's freezing outside.
Surprisingly enough, the bike ride actually wasn't THAT bad. Despite being -8. My legs were freezing though, so the jeans did nothing!
I fucking hate Vorst Nationaal. Too bad Fall Out Boy is doing their concert there.

Trix and AB are the best concert halls imo. 
Kudos to all the absolute legends I spotted this morning (quite a few to my surprise) who faced -8 temperatures. 
That's going to suck when you leave tonight. 
Complete reverse for me. I went to Duna and back but can't for the life of me get a plane of the ground.

The fruit in my backpack froze during my bicycle commute. That's nice. So does the padding of my headset, so it's rock hard when I arrive at work.
All Microsoft exams for example.
Yup, already downloaded the Packet Tracer. When I do every exercise from the Todd Lammle book I'm probably good to try again.
And tbh, I'm not even mad about it. I would much rather solve a question where I have to configure VLANs than trying to remember what a UDP header looks like. The former is actually useful IRL, the latter is not.
Glorious. I should x-post that to /r/furry_irl and reap thousands in karma. 
So, the Cisco CCNA exam is euhm... Not quite what I expected. I expected a multiple choice exam so I was pretty surprised when they suddenly gave me a virtual environment and said "Now configure all the routers and switches according to the requirements".

I only read the theory and did not make a single exercise. Whoops.

Despite all that, I did fairly well and I'm pretty sure it was the theory that good me in the end (ironic). Just 12 points (out of 1000) short to pass. Better luck next time I guess.
Stopped buying soda about three years ago. We literally only drink tap water and coffee/tea at home. 

The downside is that you can't offer any drinks to people who come visit. "Oh, what do you have?" Uhm, I have tap water.
Fun fact: you may legally park on the sidewalk in Belgium if you leave 1.5m of free room for pedestrians. And of course, we can take up the full space of a regular spot as well.
I'm liking this Black Mirror episode.
They did this exact thing in Bojack Horseman with Princess Carolyn and Ralph Stilton. (Cat/Mouse)

> I'm just using semantics to be an asshole because your comment gives the impression that you're a judgemental, unsympathetic asshole

DING DING DING. Winner winner chicken dinner.

At least when it comes to shit like this. Not drinking until you end up hospitalized is really not hard.
Don't tell a man how he should be fucking!
Funny. I feel the same way. I have never seen any good yiff of Tigress. At least not a lot.

Maybe it's the way the character is designed? The characters in Kung-Fu Panda aren't really much to look at to begin with.
... You're not a coworker of mine either, are you?
Yeah, I only do it in places I know it's somewhat safe. Which is definitely not everywhere.

Perks of a 10 year old second-hand I guess. Definitely doesn't look brand spanking new anymore.
Yeah, I think you're onto something here. Maybe they could use, I don't know, a popular song everyone knows as a guideline to how much distance you should keep? It sounds so stupid it may just work!
Aah, good old typical Belgian driver behavior. "One car length MAXIMUM!" And I can't even blame some people. Leave more room than that and someone is sure to squeeze in there. 
> Of course I didn’t read the article, but I assume they’re talking about university students who are (to some degree, excuse the pun) not margies by the conventional definition.

If you drink until you pass out or end up in hospital you're pretty marginaal in my book.
Certainly do. "Ne nee hebt ge, ne ja kunt ge krijgen."

Just make sure not to mention the house. I jokingly said to our HR guy "Ja, kijk. Ik heb net een huis gekocht en heb een lening af te betalen dus eeuhh... Goeie reden voor nen dikke opslag he."

He knew I was kidding, and then said that some people actually legit tried to use that as an excuse as to why they should get a raise. It doesn't work.
It feels so incredibly nice just being able to pass all those poor people stuck queuing in their cars. I'm also glad most car drivers are actually pretty friendly and move a bit to the right so you can pass them.
I just analysed my raises again. I don't remember all of them 100% but I think they want like this:

March 15: 6 months after the signing of my contract. Standard raise after "evaluation".

January 16: Yearly evaluation.

May 16: I think I got a Microsoft MCSA certificate there, which we agreed in january would result a in a raise.

November 16: A special meeting with HR and my boss because I wasn't happy with my wage anymore. Had a long and good talk, got a raise and the promise that it would go up more if I got the Microsoft MCSE certificate I was studying for.

March 17: Got the certificate.

January 18: Again, yearly evaluation.
Marginalen gonna marginaal, I guess.
Giving away my salary pseudo-anonymously is one thing. But combining that with specifics about where I live? No thx. 
Mine appear to be salted and don't feel slippery, so lucky me. Reminds me to thoroughly rinse it off later today though.

But I do have to admit that the patches of ice left and right on the side aren't really good for my confidence. 
Go for it.
8k sub 40? That's very nice. Did my 8k yesterday in 45. Used to be able to do it though, but spent way too much time not running due to our moving. 
Went to work with the motorcycle for the first time every day this week. Didn't die. Guess I'm legit now.

But I really do hope my bicycle gets fixed before Monday. Temperatures around 0 are one thing, but -5 and lower is something else.
It's a nice change of pace from the usual "DAE all religion is fucking evil and should be banned?"
Normally we have an evaluation once a year, in january. That yields in an immediate raise most of the time. However, during that conversation it's not uncommon to set some goals that yield an additional raise, like getting a certificate. So when I get that certificate a few months later, I cash in the agreed upon raise.

Yeah, Belgium is a clusterfuck of weird stuff and politics but their motorcycle rules actually make pretty good sense. And from general experience: Most people do respect motorcyclists by keeping their distance and giving room. Belgians love to speed though, so don't be surprised to be overtaken or some people riding pretty close to your rear if you're going the correct speed.

Good to know: you can also only filter between the two left-most lanes by the way. So if there is a lot of traffic on the highway (always) and there are 3 or more lanes that's something to keep in mind. 
... Fuck. RIP Reddit account.
Belgian here. Headlight on is mandatory. Filtering is legal if the traffic goes slower than 50km/h and your speed difference is no more than 20. So if the traffic is going 20km/h you can go 40km/h max.
I don't even take my company car to work. Because I *choose* to commute by bicycle.

Let's take you seriously for a second: What do you suggest? You have to choose something at one point. So do you choose a job, and then a house in function of that job. Or do you choose a place to live, and then a job of function of that place to live? Would you honestly move every few years if your job relocated? 
Why would you think that?
> hometown, job location and comfort are not negotiable.

And why would they be wrong? I just bought a house, I sure as hell am not going to move when I switch jobs. Job location is not always negotiable either. Nearly every IT or Banking company are based in and around Brussel so if that's your sector you're out of luck. And when you're used to a certain level of comfort it's very difficult to take a step down after X years. 
> 1 salary before taxes for every childbirth + when i get married

That is seriously awesome. I got 200 euro tax-free for my wedding. 
I just bought a house as well. Karma and gold pls. 
God damned, I keep seeing you degenerates literally everywhere, on every god damn random subreddit I visit.


^^^See ^^^you ^^^at ^^^/r/furry_irl.
> The positive thing is, I can easy find somewhere else work and earn between 250-500 net more so just waiting for the evalution....

Then go for it. Your current employer is never going to give you a raise that much.
Of course patterns would emerge, that wouldn't really be world-shocking news. 
But you're around 2k netto as well, so nothing to be afraid about to post? 
I've been on a few smaller side-projects to Brussels. If I had to do that every single day I would start looking elsewhere pretty rapidly I think. Now I can be home by 4:30 every day if I want without having to get up at 5 in the morning.
To be fair, when I just started working I probably wouldn't have replied to that thread because my wage back then was well below average. Probably only people who either feel confident about their wage or are just being very open comment there.

*Edit: Confirmed. In the same thread two years ago I did mention my wage, but instead complained about being underpayed. I fixed that.
Yeah, that honestly surprised me as well.
Cool. Sounds like an interesting field. 
You can always get better. But I like my job and my current position is a mere 12km bicycle ride from home. Really not willing to switch jobs. Also pretty sure I'm going to exceed the 3K bruto mark this year so for me that's pretty "on track". 

I also should have gotten a bigger raise this year, but I hadn't really achieved anything professionally in 2017 (no new certificates and whatnot) because my personal life had been so busy (wedding, house).
Call me naive, but I trust them enough not to do that. It's a relative small consulting company with a very familiar atmosphere. 
I showed them some examples and they were like "Fine, sure, whatever, just get that out of my face." Pretty easy tbh.  
Mine pays for the yiff. Can't get a better extralegal advantage than that. 
What job do you do specifically with that master?
Whatever you're being payed as a Sharepoint consultant, it's not enough. 
"Uitdelen" reads as "for free" to me. Never seen free earplugs at concert halls (AB, Trix, Vorst).
Master.
Sure, why not.

I saw the first one ages ago, but I never understood the reference until I saw Brotherhood. But I can't really tell for sure. I only saw Brotherhood recently. 
My ears are happy when it sounds **good**, which it hardly does when it's overly loud. It even causes physical discomfort for me. How some people can stand at the front row of the AB with no hearing protection is beyond me.

This should be mandatory everywhere imho.

The exceptions don't sound too harsh or hard to implement tbh. 
The reference is from Brotherhood btw, so make sure to watch that.

Beat me to it.
Wes Anderson's "Fantastic Mr. Fox" 

Featuring George Clooney as Mr. Fox. It's an awesome movie, in Wes' typical style.
Fuck those star ratings. How many stars is that on your screenshot? 4? 4,2? 4.1432?

Just give it 4, or 5, but don't colour these stars in randomly. 
Everything, and I mean literally everything on Netflix has at least "80%" match for me. I just ignore their weird rating system because before that everything had at least 4,33453 stars out of five.
Had a Combi ticket for Graspop to years ago but didn't set foot to the camping once. We just commuted back and forth by car every day. At least then you get to sleep in your own bed and have a good night rest. The first shows start somewhere around noon anyway so you can sleep in.
In regards to fog on the visor: "Try Dreft, that's a good trick!"

MY ASS. It made things even worse. Instead of a thing layer of fog my breath immediately turned to water on my visor making me see even less. Unfortunately my visor does not support Pinlock, so I've got to get my hands on some RainX or something soon.

No, what I mean is that you can perfectly believing in a Deity and pray to your God(s) while not denying any science. The Big Bang Theory was proposed by a Belgian priest. And AFAIK there are some religious people working at CERN. 
OwO
When are these people going to realize that religion and science can in fact go hand in hand? 
> That's illegal. While striking isn't.

I find that so weird. Why would that be illegal?

> Better than no system at all and schools start acting like companies out for profit.

Well, if it works for literally every other company?
> but I always wonder how good they are for protection

Not sure where you're from, but in Belgium (and I think all of Europe) you must wear a helmet that has a CE approval rating. Because of this, nearly every single helmet sold has this rating. Mine is a Nolan costing about 150 euro. My shoes, vest, pants, and gloves (all obligated gear around here) set me back about 500 euro in total. All CE approved and safe riding gear.
> If the leadership is acting in bad faith, then yes, there is absolutely no other way than doing something that puts their income in danger.

Then just announce loud and clear that they will not be inspecting the validity of your ticket?

> This is why "vaste benoemingen" in schools are so important.

Hahahahaha. "Vaste benoeming" serve no other purpose but fucking over young teachers and protecting the ones that stopped actually teaching ages ago. Thinking there are less political games with vaste benoemingen is naive at best.
I asked myself the same thing when my motorcycle manual advised to use Kerosene to clean the chain. "Oh, sure. Let me just go to the grocery store and pick up a barrel of airplane fuel."
Can confirm. Turned on my heated grips this morning and it was a godsend.

His official name is Moesila, [but we are calling him Moesti.](https://i.imgur.com/eULf7ga.jpg).

Got him from Dieren In Nood near Maaseik and he just turned 4. Super cuddly cat. Always comes to lay on our lap when we watch TV.
Just had a week long holiday. Took the time to clean the bike thoroughly, lube the chain, all good to go. Went on a few rides as well, the weather was pretty nice.

And now that my bicycle is in the shop, I *had* to take the motorcycle to work for the first time. 15 minutes, holy shit. That's an academy record. A bit chilly though.
Back from holiday. We got a cat and we did some prep work in our soon-to-be garden (just a braakliggend stuk grond) at the moment. Did I miss any good 'ol Reddit drama? 
I know, it was just a lame excuse. (As if I needed any)
You can ask, but a hard no is a no I'm afraid. The company I'm currently working for does not allow working from home either. The reason is "Omdat de arbeiders die mogelijkheid ook niet hebben, en dat is niet eerlijk."

Everyone of course thinks it's a stupid and outdated rule, we could all work at least 2 or 3 days per week from home but "a no is a no". (In reality everyone's manager here will allow it from time to time though, "but don't talk about it.")
My high school traject was simply called "Math-Sciences", and it included, as the name implies, lots of math and science classes like chemistry and physics. We used the graphical calculator in math to plot graphs and it was allowed to calculate more complex equations.

At the beginning of every exam though, the overseer would come and hard reset every one of our calculators to make sure we didn't have any cheat sheets stored.
Just to chime in here: I've had a very different experience from my local Harley Davidson dealer. I visited them because I wanted to test drive the Street Rod. I was looking for small bike, and this was their cheapest model. I had already test-driven the Triumph Street Twin and had planned test drives with the BMW R Nine T and Moto Guzzi V7 as well. So I wasn't sure about what to get yet.

The sales guy was a very friendly guy, and when I mentioned the Street Twin he actually said those are "very good bikes indeed". After the test drive I gave him my honest opinion that I didn't really like the way it handled. No hard feelings from his end, "it's not for everyone and I can perfectly understand that". He ended with how I should visit him again to showoff the bike I would eventually get.

So there was no definitely no "us vs the rest" mentality in that dealership whatsoever. I should visit the guy again soon with the Kawasaki I ended up getting second hand.

Edit: I did feel a bit out of place in the dealership though. It was filled with stereotypical Harley dudes and I felt like my beard wasn't nearly long enough to be able to ride a Harley. 
Docker support. Amazing.
They have the toys on display, just tell them which one you want. It's not hard.
Same here. We needed one of those TI 84-Plus Silvers for math and science classes. Cost 120 euro back then, still costs 120 euro now. Literally the same device.
Some phones Mute buttons play a hold tone apparently. Would not recommend.
Why not? SpaceX certainly has more budget than NASA or ESA to fiddle around and experiment with rockets.

I bought one of those fancy leak-proof tires. More expensive but ever since I got them I never had a leak again. Mine used to bust at least twice a month as well.

I bought one two weeks ago. Glorious! Keeps me warm, and I can pull it over my head so I look like Kakashi. Sounds like a win-win to me!
Indeed they should.

But the class councils exist just because they are human and not machines. It would be very easy to let a computer decide: 50+ is A, 40-50 is B, 40- is C.
That may be, but teachers are humans. If you are likeable and have shown that you are a "good student" and shown interest and effort they will be much more inclined to let you pass compared to someone with similar grades but a shitty attitude in class.
That's another thing stopping me from going to work with the motorcycle this week. It has always slept inside AFAIK, and does now. Not sure what sudden subzero temperatures are going to do with the battery and whatnot.

So the raining has stopped, so that's nice. I was pondering about finally going to work with the motorcycle but I swiftly abandoned that idea after slipping a few times with my bicycle this morning... Patches of ice everywhere!

No, certainly not. It's actually pretty bonkers I was able to learn it from my mom whose knowledge of the traffic rules was dubious at times.

And I'm definitely not mad I had to take mandatory motorcycle lessons last summer to get my A license. 
Of course you can't catch everyone. But as the recent media example has shown it takes 30+ convictions before something is actually done.

Right now the chance of getting caught is incredibly low, but the punishment that belongs to it is incredibly low as well. I think most people will think again before getting into a car after one too many if the punishment, even if the chance of being caught is 1%, are absurdly Draconian. 
/r/delusionalartists 
Lol at the person downvoting you for actually giving a source to debunk my claim. Sad.

Appreciate it. It somewhat makes sense of course that a more experienced driver will be better at driving. I just feel that they are focusing their arrows a bit too much on the same group, whereas traffic safety should affect everyone. This is again a "free pass" for those who've had their license for years but haven't got a clue on how you should rits properly and think having one or two beers behind the wheel is OK.
I appreciate their fighting spirit but there is no way on earth they will be able to "ethically" compete with Deliveroo.
National Treasure is like the most safe and neutral movie of all.

If you're sitting at home with the entire family: grandparents, parents, children of various ages,... What movie do you put on? National Treasure.

Oh, I agree. Drunk driving? Texting behind the wheel? I'm sorry pal but there goes your license. Time to redo everything and follow some mandatory classes about traffic safety as well.

We are way too lenient about traffic offenses imho.

No, the thing is: The way I see it, these days there's a war on, right? And, ages ago, there wasn't a war on, right? So, there must have been a moment when there not being a war on went away, right?

Glad I'm not the only one who noticed this recently. First the Oscars are too white, now the Grammies are too male and the Mia's apparently was rather in your face about it? A women won a price, congratulations. Stop making a fuss about it. An artist who is doing a good job won a price, you shouldn't give two shits about what their gender is.

Feminism should be about equality but it's starting to feel more like a "women are better, start dealing with it" narrative.

> Easy for you to say, Matvalicious, you straight white cis male.

I was actually quoting my wife's reaction from this morning to something Coely said at the Mia's.
Yesterday was somewhat ok, true.
I test rode a Harley last summer (Street Rod). I get the appeal and understand why people like the brand, but it was definitely not for me. I had the constant feeling that the bike was riding me instead of me riding the bike.

Honest question regarding the commercial: Are there no laws regarding what gear you need to wear over where this is filmed? No way on earth someone in their right mind would climb on a motorcycle dressed like that. I guess "safety" is not really high up in their "how do we want to portray our brand" list.
Nice one, congratulations.

Going through your posts.

Though I do not agree with your standpoint, I have no idea what subreddit rules you broke that would warrant a ban. Is it because of rule 2 "no bigotry"?

Mods, when is someone considered a bigot?

> Bigot: a person who is intolerant towards those holding different opinions.

There seem to be a lot of people who are pretty intolerant of my opinions in another "controversial" thread from this week. Are they bigots?
I agree with /u/Scarity here, I find empathy from random strangers rather creepy. Especially via social media.

There used to be this "trend" on facebook where when someone died and it got in the news because it was a tragic accident or whatever, dozens of "RIP xxx" pages would pop up. I have always found that incredibly unnerving.

It was allright. In the end it doesn't really matter at all where you studied informatics. Everyone and their dog starts at the bottom of IT consulting anyway and works up from there.
As I said, my rhetoric is not one of "it's a refugee, hence it's not a human so its life has no value."

It's that off "play stupid games, win stupid prizes." My reaction would be the same for people eating Tide pods or climbing electricity poles.

I am not downplaying the fact that there are some serious questions to be raised about the whole situation though. Europe is failing hard with its immigration policy and everyone is paying the price. But that's not for me to fix.
Please don't quote half sentences.
Irrelevant. He could be called Jonas Peeters for all I care and be whiter than mayonnaise. Glad you ignored my example regarding people who get themselves run over by trains though.
It's hard to feel sad for someone who deliberately ran from the police, into highway traffic and probably traumatized an innocent driver for life.

Same way I will never feel sad for people who get hit by trains because they ignored the red light or ran over the tracks.

> Bakery bread is far superior to supermarket stuff anyway .

My baker has absolutely fantastic pistolets, but their bread sucks. When I buy bread from any baker, it hardens within the day. Supermarket bread stays good for at least two.

And nothing comes close to Delhaize's Ardeens brood imho.
Fallen from the lorry, maybe?
French management. Enough said.
Yeah, pretty much everywhere but here I think.
It's been ages since I went to a Carrefour but since yesterday I understand why that company is slowly fading away.

I am used to Delhaize where you can walk in, buy a single item like a loaf of broad, walk to the self-checkout, scan the thing, pay for the thing, and walk out. 5 minutes tops.

Apparently, the "self-checkout" at Carrefour doesn't allow you to quickly scan the items yourself. Instead you have to, get this, get in a QUEUE to hand over your self-scan device to a lady sitting behind a register, who then scans it for you, and you have to pay her. So there is no real added value to the self-scan there.

So there I stood, with my loaf of bread, having to queue for one of the two open registers, stuck behind a bunch of old people who all wanted to pay in small change and then complained that they didn't recognize the two euro piece they got back and claimed it was a fake.

No thank you, Carrefour, I will just get my bread on the way home from somewhere else.
Can we please finally arrive at [CURRENT YEAR] and be able to just ask for a can of tap water at restaurant? I always, and only, drink tap water at home and drives me up the wall I have to pay at least 7 euro for a measly liter which I easily drink on my own.

In the Scandinavian countries you sit down and they promptly put a can of tap water on your table.
What did you get?
People using their phone while driving has always been a pet peeve of mine and there is nothing that drives me more up the wall. When I see friends, family, or coworkers do it (my coworkers like to post pictures on our closed facebook group that were obviously taken while driving) I will always call them out on that.

But as you said. Big mentality issue. Most of the time the only reply you get is "En gij doet nooit niks verkeerd of wa?"

I ride my bicycle to work as well and nearly every single one of the schoolkids going to school is too busy looking at their phone instead of the road. These are the same people who will soon learn how to drive with a car. Very scary thought. 

I once told a woman what a nice example she was for her children because she busy Whatsapping behind the wheel with her two kids in the back seat. Mostly you get a middle finger and a "piss off" in return.

I feel we need utterly Draconian measures. Things that will make people complain how they are "blown WAY out of proportion." You should at least have to redo your theoretical and practical if you get caught imo.
BA 253? They quoted me for 375 so I think they consider age/experience over the bike itself.
I heard good stuff from Materne via the 9lives forum and got a VERY expensive quote from them as well. I was pretty surprised about that.
Do your civic duty and report them.
My wife saw a student being dropped off at school recently in a brand, spanking new Audi Q7, driven by the mother. Family claims they are "unable to pay the school bills".

So yeah, it wouldn't hurt to have a more thorough look at some of those people.
Ok, I'll bite.

Surprisingly enough, they abolished the telegram only last month in Belgium. It is still actively used in France.
Awesome. Good luck!
Now there's a euphemism I have never heard before.
Do we really not have a SINGLE politician that has the guts to propose zero-tolerance for EVERYONE? This really tells you a thing or two about our common mentality when it comes to drinking and driving.

Imo, the punishment for pulling that shit can't be harsh enough.

Also, who in their right mind would hop on a motorcycle after drinking? Maybe I'm naive but I think motorcyclists are a lot more concerned about their own safety to do stuff like that. I am MUCH more concerned about everyone else around me in their big cars, looking at their phones, who've had one too many.

You laugh, but my insurer mentioned there are actually shuldsaldoverzekeringen that don't pay if you, for example, had a wine during diner and then fall down the stairs because of "alcohol intoxication". 
I arrived at the DIV one hour before opening time and got ticket number 8. Not so bad. I was done in half an hour.

But now the plate is being sent to my old address because we haven't officially moved yet... Great!
Actual cop shedding his light on the situation.

Are we going to ignore the obvious solution of not having any illegal drugs on you at all?

I know reddit loves to 420 Blaze It and get its dick hard for pro-legalization but as of today it remains illegal and you should just deal with it.
As far as your motorcycle insurance is concerned, most insurers offer an optional insurance that covers you for injury and death even if you are at fault. (At least Touring, Ethias,.. do). So at least that's something?

If that doesn't work out, it doesn't sound like you are stuck with Cardif for your schuldsaldo (not in the akte of your house?) so you can shop around for something else if needed.
"Oh, you have a hobby that is shared by nearly every Belgian male over 40? No coverage for you buddy."
Damn, those are some harsh conditions. I really should check mine then. What bank is this?
Explicitly? That's weird. Does it really say "You are covered for this and that and everything unless you crash with a motorcycle, then you can kindly fuck off"? Time to check on the details of my own mortgage life insurance then, lol.

Anyway, Belgians love insurances so maybe you can work out an additional clause with your bank to cover this?
There was no targeting involved because they checked everyone equally. If they only picked out the black kids, or the kids with the baggy jeans, that would be targeting.

Also, how insecure are you that you feel threatened or targeted by a routine check? I really wouldn't give two fucks. 
>  The police were actually targetting minors/children, without consent of their parents.

TIL the police need consent of the parents to check on minors.

Sure. Just knock on the door and go talk to him, especially in the context of what happened in Vegas. 
You are severely implying some shit here. Why would I "never again trust the police" if I was part of a routine check. Do you feel the same way if they pull you over for an alcohol test? 
> As he inched forward, he reached toward the waistband of his shorts.

Why would I get angry? Don't pull shit like that when you've got a gun pointed at you.

> It was exactly like this 

Sure, I'm positive they pointed guns at the students and told them they were going to shoot if they didn't get down on the ground asap /s

Going to Architects myself next week.
Which one?
Yup. Guy from Touring said I needed to go to DIV myself with the pink paper and motorcycle documents. Plate will come via post the next day.

But to be honest, I think it's faster if you do it yourself anyway. Just hoping all those horror stories of 50 people waiting at 6AM turn out to be greatly exaggerated. 
Need to go to Antwerp. And it's a second hand vehicle so no WebDiv via the insurer either. I really have to go to the office and hand them the papers myself.
Going to the DIV tomorrow morning before work, please pray for me. Probably going to start queuing 2 hours in advance so I'm one of the first and I can get somewhat on time to work.
I saved even more when I moved in with my girlfriend.
Not sure how it is with cars, but for houses you can put a "opschortende voorwaarde" stating the seller gives you X weeks time to fix a loan. If you can't, the sale is void.
Yes, that's exactly what I meant with "saving as much as you can" /s

I did exactly that, and I didn't skip going out or buying games every now and then. It just means you don't spend 200 euro on drinks every weekend.

And I would do it all again because I am now a very proud house owner. So yeah, for me the house is a little piece of utopia. Utopia comes at a certain cost, and everyone's Utopia is different.
"Bomb-making chemicals" Nice sensationalization by The Mirror there. Every chemical is "bomb-making" with the right processes. 

Is this account a bot by the way? All it seems to do is grab news articles that contain the name of a country and then post it to that sub.
Ask a contract proposal at Touring insurances over the phone. "Great, you'll have it in your inbox in a few minutes."

Two hours later, still nothing. Call them again. "Oh, your system may be blocking our emails. Do you have another?" I give another address, but still nothing.

"Ok, we'll send it by post then." 

Urgh. I find it pretty hard to believe that both Gmail and Outlook would block their e-mails. I spelled out my name letter by letter, so I swear to God if I receive their proposal in the mail and my name/e-mail is wrong...
If you live at home at don't have to give too much to your parents and save like 90% of your wage it is absolutely doable. Start working at 21 for 1600 euro netto, save as much as you can. 5 years later you will have at least 60k.

But that implies you have a plan at 18 and actually realise you need to start saving money NOW if you want a house before 30. My wife has 30+ coworkers who are still renting and complaining about house prices but in the meantime spend about 200 euro per weekend on going out.
I see this with a lot of my friends, but I also suspect/know they have no "financial plan" so to speak. Every euro they earn is immediately spent on random shit. So when the times comes they have to pay something back or something it's "oh, can I do this next month?"

I know a lot of people can't help it or legit don't have much money left at the end of the month but when I see them boasting on facebook how they bought this and that it raises more than few eyebrows. 
Exactly. "Due to the increased terror level, all visitors must be announced 2 days in advance and everyone must wear their badge at all times."

Whooptiedoo, that is definitely going to stop someone from ramming his vehicle into the premises and setting off a bomb.
Yeah, about 80% of our boxes were my wife's teacher stuff as well.
Ethias was 500 something and can only give me a small discount because of our apartment fire insurance. Which is going to end in a few days anyway.
It's amazing how much stuff you have. You don't realise that until you need like 50 banana boxes.
> but at least your car insurance is free?

Yeah, that is true. Too bad our company moved away from Baloise, otherwise I could have scored one hell of a deal.

Going to ask my own bank Argenta, where I have my mortgage and all other insurances, what they can do about the price. If it's not much I'll just go with Touring and shop around again next year.
Are you all right mate?
Moving sucks, but the first day you get home from work and you're just coming "home" and everything you need is right there? Glorious!
How did you get a quote like that in the first place? I'm 27, and the bike is "only" 650cc and from 2008 no less. No idea how they can quote me for 611 with that data.
A blurry picture of games. Paging /r/shitpost
Karma's a bitch. Baloise was going to give me a 70% discount, resulting in about 240 per year, because of the company car.

But get this.... My company isn't with Baloise anymore since a few months. And our current insurer doesn't do company car discounts. FML.
Argenta. It appears that their vehicle insurance team and their general banking team are separate entities because they couldn't give me any discount on the motorcycle insurance. About 650 BA+Rechtsbijstand.
Still waiting on an answer from KBC, but she already mentioned it's probably going to be around 400 because I don't have a car to insure.
Rechtsbijstand I think, which is optional with Touring. Didn't really go over the details because the difference is way too big. 
Guilty as charged, but that's because most Belgian garages are barely big enough to fit a car. So the choice you have to make is "Do I store some stuff, maybe some canned food or an extra freezer in my garage? Maybe put my washer and dryer there? Or leave it nearly completely empty to fit my car?" 

And when there's room in the street, the choice is quickly made.
Yup. Just did. DVV with a whopping 611 euro. At Baloise their system was down but they should back to me this afternoon.

Looks like it's going to be Touring. Still expensive with 315 for just the bare minimum (BA only) though, but much cheaper than everyone else.
Now that makes sense.

All right, same question as /u/Munith then because that seems like the most portable lock if you don't have bags or a space under your seat.
Upvoted for pun.

Related question from me: [How does a lock like thos work?](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1KBWNeqagSKJjy0Fcq6AZeVXaQ/Hot-Motorbike-Motorcycle-Alarm-Disc-Lock-Security-Spring-Reminder-Cable-Red-Bicycle-Scooter-Security-Tool-Car.jpg_640x640.jpg) because it looks like you can easily slide it off or cut it.
Implying I'm social enough to go out with internet strangers.
Seems like the problem just solved itself then. I assume at least half of those people are more than willing to take in some refugees /s
I've seen this "live" on TV when they first broadcasted it. I lost my shit like you woulnd't believe it.

Still regularly quote parts from it with some friends.
Wife and I had a look at the second hand Kawasaki ER-6N this weekend. One scratch on the side from it topping over once, but nothing too bad. Mechanically everything seemed perfectly fine. It immediately started, and drove pretty good. 99% sure going to buy it. And it fits my wife as well, so it's perfect if she wants to get her license in a few years as well. 

Now if the damn insurance brokers would reply to my e-mails from last Wednesday... 
How the fuck is that relevant? Literally any old bum can become a millionaire overnight with the right idea.
The joke really misses it's point with the name blanked out though.
I went to their gig for the preshow, which was August Burns Red. The room was full of scene kids with skinny jeans and colourful hair. Now I don't mind that, to each there own of course, but AA? They just play backed the entire thing. Badly I might add as well.
You are right. They should take their time to load their guns with blanks before firing warning shots. /s
> stop putting refugees on par with people who send death threats and people who attack the police.

He's not though.
Going to look at a second hand motorcycle tomorrow. Did all the research I can to check it for issues and I hope the weather will be nice enough for a short test drive. Going to be cold with my summer gloves though. 

Now if only those damn insurance companies would e-mail me their offers.
I love this. I've got a Moroccan co-worker who is constantly spewing such stereotypical HLN-level "racist" shit on facebook pages as well. It's hilarious.
Listening to it with crappy ANC headphones at work: "Hmm, not bad."

God damned, that new NWS sites is SO BAD. [This is what it looks like. Fullscreen.](https://imgur.com/a/C1Dex). Absolutely zero content unless you scroll and be presented with letters in font 72.

Or... just not drink like some people do? It's not like you need to justify that to anyone. 
There's a huge difference between the right to strike, i.e. not doing the job you are supposed to do, and placing roadblocks on highways. You can't also bomb the airport and claim it's because you are striking. 
I don't commission stuff.
Got Hue since a few days as well. It's a bit gimmicky but nice that I can program the lights to turn on when I wake up and automatically go out when I leave.

Probably getting a Google Home once it releases here officially. 
Bass guitar.
I pray to the weather gods that they don't change the direction of the wind today. Because then I will be home in 10 minutes instead of 40 tonight.

Holy shit, those headwinds were though today.
Only BA and Rechtsbijstand. Weird thing is they only needed the amount of cc the bike has, not the KW, the age, how long I've had my license...

I guess car/motorcycle insurance isn't really their core business, but I still would have hoped for a discount.

In the meantime I've contacted a few brokers and asked them who can give me a discount if I have a company car which is my main vehicle. 
Just over 100 consultants, but technically still a "family business", yes.
Mine does. Getting a new certificate is leverage for the yearly wage negotiations. And it doesn't look bad on your resume imho. I've never heard of anyone getting hired because they had them, but it's nice to collect them.
Browsing insurances for the potential Kawasaki.

650 with Argenta? Even though I have my mortgage and all other insurances there? 540 with Ethias? 800+ with various others?!

Touring is consistently offering me 315 via their simulation. Also contacted DVV to hear them out.
It was quite a few years ago. I'm doing my very best to remember it and digging through my e-mail and calendar appointments but I can't find anything unfortunately. I'd have to ask my mom if she remembers where we went.
The weird thing is that no-one, not even myself, were realizing I was hyperventilating. I never really was short of breath or anything. I think I was just breathing very shallow and rapidly or not exhaling enough or something.
IT here. Still doing multiple exams per year. Gotta get those sweet, sweet certificates. Employers love that.
I had unexplained headaches for years. Not migraine-bad, but pretty bad. And I had them at least 3 times a week. Various scans came up with nothing, until there was one doctor who put some needles attached to a scanning device in my head and told me to just start breathing. After a few minutes the machine confirmed what he suspected.

Turns out I was chronically hyperventilating without even realizing it, causing my nerve endings to become oversensitive. A few sessions of breathing exercises later I hardly have headaches anymore.
You euhm... Need a combi oven/microwave? Selling ours.

You can look up the kadaster online: http://ccff02.minfin.fgov.be/cadgisweb/?local=nl_BE (warning: uses Flash).

If the lot is one big piece he probably can do what he want. If it's divided in multiple smaller lots he can't just expand his lot by taking a piece of another.
Damn, that's awesome. Too bad I didn't know them back than.

Sounds weird. If they are two separate houses, they each have their own kadaster, and you can't just expand your kadaster into someone else's, even if you own both lots.

Maybe forward the question to someone from your local town hall, or huurdersbond. 
Holy shit, what a line-up.

I really hope these guys come visit Europe sometime.
It took about 2 or 3 listens but I love it now. Frequently still put it on.

I prefer Flash Flood of Colour above it because that's so incredibly energetic and full of great songs. The Spark however is such a moving and personal album. Read up on Rou's story and what he went through in recent years and then listen to the lyrics of some of the songs.
Can someone please e-mail this to Groen and see what they have to say to it?
Could you elaborate a bit further on that? Why is she not according to you? She was born and raised here, does pretty good for herself with her studies and whatnot, and speaks our language.
\*Looks up Niken\* 

Oh...
She's pretty small. But a whole lot of "ifs", lets first see if I like it somewhat.
I'm not a tall guy (<1m80), and it would be a nice-to-have if my wife can learn to ride on it in the future as well so for us that would actually be a plus point.
Visited Motors Thomas G. in Stabroek on a whim yesterday because they had a kind of "Salon-opendeurdag". Man, those Triumphs were all looking at me again. That white shiny Street Twin, damn. And that T120 Black with brown leather seat is just gorgeous. 

But anyway, that's not what I was there for. I was there for his second-hand stuff. He didn't have very much at that time, a tiny bit too early in the year for that. But he did heavily recommend keeping an eye open for a Kawasaki ER-6N/F. Already spotted a few which don't look *too* bad, and very decently priced as well. I hope I can see and ride a few of them in person this week.
> Telenet never cared, nobody ever contacted her. So I rang Telenet dealer support and explained the situation. Sadly, Yvette had already changed to Orange - due to her excessive bills

So... Yvetteje didn't care either. She got absurdly high bills, didn't bother trying to contact anyone at Telenet or her family to try and figure out *why*, but instead allowed this to go on for three months before changing provider because "Telenet charges too much".

I'm very sorry, but this one is on her.
So it seems.

I don't get Patreon. People produced content just fine before Patreon, now all of a sudden every "artist" and their dog needs an X amount of money per month in order to get shit done. Some even have the guts to put on their Patreon page "they will use the money for rent, food, and art stuff." I've backed a few Kickstarters to help people get their comic or book published but at least there you actually get the end result in return. It will be a cold day in hell before I throw money at anyone's Patreon, no matter how good their porn is.

What's that saying about a fool and his money? Good for them though. Most of the stuff ends up on e621 after a while anyway. 
Still a bit torn between a rock and a hard place if I should save up for the bike I want, or cave now and settle for something cheaper which I can use for a year or 2.

Besides 2dehands.be and autoscout, which are good websites and/or physical places to browse second hand bikes?
Thanks for the Spotify playlists! Seeing some of my own favourites on there as well as some bands I've never heard of. Going to be interesting. 
I think I read an article a while ago that claimed that having to change your password every X days actually increases the risk of security breaches because shit like this causes people to write it down instead of remembering it.

I have a pretty strong password anyway, which I can remember just fine. But I have to change it every 30 days as well. So far I've been able to just slap a "!" behind it every time.
Now we're getting somewhere!

I really don't like Firefly. I barely made it through the first episode because I was so bored. But I get the appeal, it's just not for me.

> Matvalicious, why do you log on every evening at 9 and only surf to a website which seems to be about monosodium glutamate for some reason?
At the north/east side, during the evening? I'll give it a shot, maybe the neighbours are really stupid. Haven't really met them yet.
The only downside at the new house is that the computer is now in the living room, facing the front window and we don't have curtains.

I used to be able to fap in peace, sitting on the second floor of a building with no possibility to look in. Now I have to either drop the blinds which is extremely suspicious since we don't tend to do that, or I have to take the tablet to the bedroom or something like some kind of weirdo. 

It's a cruel world where a man can't just masturbate in the comfort of his living room without the fear of being spotted and judged by the neighbours for beating the meat to Renamon giving head to Lucario.

I'm hinting at the fact that this is definitly not the first time a thread like this pops up here. And it's always the same: OP describes being in a shitty situation, but some people immediately point out some flaws in the story. When advice is given, it is downplayed or ignored. OP is never thankful. A few hours later, there's usually a thread in Belgiummeta complaining about how right winged this sub is, and how people in shitty situations are treated like social pariahs.

I always buy my stuff from alternate.be. They have a pretty big stock.

But if you know what brand and model you're going to buy it's worth checking Tweakers pricewatch to see where it's cheapest. 
Those are exactly the video's I started watching yesterday.
I would start by upgrading your HDD to an SSD. This is relatively cheap, especially nowadays, and will give you the largest speed boost.

Then you could still decide if you wish to upgrade your entire notebook or not. The SSD is never lost, and could easily be re-used in the new notebook, or in another computer.
I have to agree to that. The interface is a clusterfuck and they explain absolutely nothing. There's an ingame manual but I'm not going to read 300 pages first. After randomly clicking some buttons I just started watching Youtube tutorials and beginner's guides instead.

That makes sense. 
For three years our landlord was very nice to us. We didn't see or hear from her. In return, we were nice as well. We never called or e-mailed for small issues. And for big issues, we always offered to solve it ourselves first.

Our rental contract ends at the end of January, but we are planning to move to the new house at the beginning of January. "Great", she says. "That means I can get some minor renovations done in January so I can place a new tenant in February already. Of course you won't have to pay full rent for that month then."

That was last month. Yesterday we got an e-mail of her stating that "we should pay the last month in full, and the reason the works are being done in January already is because it wouldn't bother us anyway."

Well, that was an unexpected and sucky turn of events. I replied with how disappointed I am in this decision, and that we're doing our very best to make sure the apartment is empty in the beginning of January. If flexibility can't come from both sides, I could very easily say "nope, you're only allowed to begin your renovations in February."

Let's see where this goes but I'm mildly annoyed about this.
Why not? If I understand correctly, the police are overwhelmed with administration work which requires actual trained policemen to do. Why can't administration be done by non-police administration employees? (After a decent screening of course).

Good luck. The government itself can't even make a decent policy about this, or all teachers are unable to get anything done properly. Companies can make up rules all they want, this is still an individual decision.

A lot of people here in this company work lots of overtime, replying to e-mails up to 9PM or even later. The company does not expect this from them, they choose to do so for various reasons. I know one of them thinks she will be able to climb the corporate ladder faster this way for example.

Me on the other hand, I have a very strict 9 to 5 mentality. I don't check my mails after hours, and when I'm on holiday I am in no way reachable. And they know this very well here.

"Just do it."

No thx, it always ends up worse. But my brakes don't loosen that fast anyway. I drop my bicycle off at the mechanic for a small maintenance every 6 months or so and I'm good to go.
Now if you were really concerned about useless packaging you wouldn't buy Gilette razors in the first place though.

Safety razors come by the dozen in a small cardboard box.
Not really. Now you get a nice bonus. If you pay them too little you own them an "unexpected" sum of money in a period that is generally pretty expensive to begin with.
> TLDR: Bike mechanics = waste of money. Just do it yourself. It's cheaper, and you'll learn something from it. 

If I could: Gladly. Wait, let me rephrase that: If I could be arsed to learn how to maintain my bicycle I would gladly. But I can't be arsed.

I tried to tighten my brakes once. Once. Never again. I literally had to go to the shop to had them tightened because I made things worse by making my brake block drag on my wheel somehow. Couldn't for the life of me fix it.

But that said: I don't feel that my bike mechanic is scamming me. Their invoice also lists all parts separately and I always feel his parts are pretty cheap. He also lists his working hours, which is of course always the biggest number but I've never felt like he overcharges or spends too much time on something.
They put signs on the escalators in metro station Groenplaats. No-one cares. I usually just use the regular stairs anyway. MUCH faster.
Very more so than in backwards third world countries, yes.  
I saw more cyclist, including myself, drive on the road yesterday. They were very clear. The bicycle lanes in some townships were not clear at all.
Indeed. Yesterday I saw some cyclists use the regular road because the bicycle lane was just one big ice course. Some asshole with his big Volvo starting honking is horn and shouting at them that the "bicycle lane is over there!"

Boo-fucking-hoo. People are risking life and limb but still choose deliberately to take their bicycle anyway. They are allowed to use the road if the bicycle lanes are unfit to drive on. Fuck that guy and everyone like that with an ice pick.
Of course it remains an individual decision. I'm not saying we should just go out and kill all our elderly (because that's what some seem to be making of it).
> Then I don't think it's too much asked to be taken care of in peace your last few years where you can't do it yourself anymore

What good does that care do if you're too demented or senile to even realise you're being taken care of? How demeaning and embarrassing is it to have a complete stranger wash you and change your diaper? I never want to experience that personally. 

I'm not talking about killing yourself when you're still good of course. I'm talking about when the first stages of dementia start kicking in. Or about the moment you stop feeling like an adult.

> Second of all, I think your children would rather have you move in with them than to ever even have a thought of what you are talking about.

My mother and my grandparents have a very firm understanding about this: My mom will not take in her parents when they become too old to take care of themselves. And she doesn't expect me to take her in either. Depends on how the situation or feeling in your family is about this of course.
The electronic version of "Het exacte bedrag, meneer?"

Nee, maak er maar van wat ge wilt.
Happiness and finances go hand in hand though. Financials reasons is part of it, yes. But even then my main message is: If I've lived my life and I feel fulfilled I should be able to die with dignity. Not waste away in an old folks home.
Not even close to what I said. But ok, I'll bite.

Let's say I've reached a certain age. I have lived a nice life, I have raised children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. There is nothing left for me to do on this planet. Now I can either

1) Crawl into an elder home where there is jack shit to do and every minute spent there is going to waste. This cost a shit ton of money. This money would have to come from my savings account which I would MUCH rather give to my children. Or it would have to come from my children directly if I have no money set aside.

2) Move in with one of my children or grandchildren. Sure, this will be cheaper but I would be a total burden for them.

Why can't I, as a consenting adult, not opt for the third decision? The decision of dying peacefully, with all my loved ones around?

We don't hesitate for a second to kill our pets when they are suffering but our elderly have to live on, sometimes for years, sometimes even against their own will. That makes zero sense to me.

Honestly, I would feel like a selfish prick. Being a burden to everyone around me both physically, mentally, and financially just to drag out those last few years? No thank you. I can only hope the laws become much more lenient in the future, or that I am just in time to somehow gracefully kill myself before I get too demented to pull it off. 
I'm keeping my eye on Poland. Apparently they can into space.
My wife had something pretty harsh to say this morning but I have to agree with her: When you feel you've had a good life and you're starting to feel like a burden to society and your loved ones, you should be allowed to get euthanization. 

I would feel horrible if my children and grandchildren had to cough up money just to prolongue my life so I can stare at a wall for days on end. No thank you, please end it right there.
I'm banned there too but they didn't even have the courtesy of sending me a PM about it.

How is that some townships like Mortsel, Edegem and Hoboken are perfectly capable of clearing their bicycle lanes, yet Wilrijk doesn't seem to giving a rat's ass about it? You could very clearly see where one town ended and the next began.

Meanwhile, "Citizens should clear their driveway of snow and ice! Or you could get a GAS boete!"
1K more "not that much"

this guy.
septante/nonante makes so much more sense for me.

Any reason why the French use "sixty-ten" and "four-twenties-ten"? 
Nothing to get to know your neighbours like a friendly neighbourhood orgy!
Oh, it was fun. The tiny snow drops, being blown into my face by hard wind. Quite painful tbh.

Still beats sitting in traffic for 2 hours, or being stuck behind someone has no fucking clue on how they should be driving in weather like this.
> I've known someone who had it done as an adult and said there is no difference. 

That's the difference right there: Consent.

I am not at all against circumcision. There are some very valid medical cases for it. But doing it to a baby for no reason at all is mutilation.
