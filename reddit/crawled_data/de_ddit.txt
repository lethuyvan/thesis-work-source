Mine actually did get a little better (had a more experimental cross-linking done) though the axis on my prescription is crazy now.
They also have a procedure now where they cut a pocket in the epithelial so you get the benefits of epithelial off without losing that layer of protection completely. Had that done at Clearview in Toronto last year and it's been pretty great so far.
Dude I was scared as fuck when I first found out (eye surgery is pretty much the only thing that wielded me out) but it ended up not being that big of a deal. Plus, the cookies I had afterwards are basically the best food I've ever eaten and I still can't tell if that the cookies or the sedation. Commented a bit more about the procedure [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/7h8hnm/the_thickness_of_my_2200_prescription_glasses/dqpo1uq/)
Hide mine done at the beginning of last year from Toronto. Went through an at the time new procedure called "pocket crosslinking" where they didnt have to completely detach the top layer of the cornea. Vision did improve after that (think the doctor performed a bit of PRK at the same time), though it didn't hit 100% and definitely hasn't deteriorated (I was diagnosed the summer before and it got noticeably worse until the procedure). Ended up being ~$5.2k in total but I think it was definitely worth it (though I still have to spend $15 or so every month or two for lubricating eyedrops lol) and I now get free optometrist appointments for life in Ontario.

I agree, I used to rub my eyes a lot before getting diagnosed just because it felt good. Completely stopped once I found out that might have been the cause in the first place.
There's also a procedure called pocket cross linking where they don't completely take the epithelium off (like the name, they make a pocket and inject the riboflavin into it). I had it done little over a year ago.

> the handheld mode is the only reason I am interested in the thing really

Agreed. I personally don't even own a TV so probably wouldn't have any need for the dock. I realize it's a bit of a weird wish, but it would have been cool if the Switch supported streaming PC games over wifi. We know the hardware is capable (based on nvidia's shield lineup) and those with capable PCs likely wouldn't be buying a multiplatform release on the Switch anyways.

Judging from the current state of things, I'll likely only pick it up (at least in the first year) either for use on vacations or if the community manages to get homebrew/Android running on it.
Serious question, since Mexico was colonized by Spain, shouldn't they be considered "white" too? (Or is it similar to how Italians also weren't considered white?)
Ah, haven't heard this before. Care to elaborate?
AFAIK, they're independent of each other.
70% is a bold estimate.

That being said, it does make things a bit easier (since you don't have to bother with dual booting, VMs, or ssh). If you can afford them, I'd say go for either the Macbook or the Surface Book (mostly because taking notes is much easier if you can write on the slides). If that's too far out of your price range, any laptop is fine really (even a chromebook would suffice if you installed ubuntu on it).

Yup, generally x64 refers to x86-64, which is what is found on PC, PS4, and Xbone. It's theoretically possible to port over a source game like Titanfall 2 over to ARM (has been done by nVidia for their shield lineup) but probably not worth the effort.

My vision is quite bad so it would be hard for me to tell the time on the Onyx but I like the general aesthetic. Aiming for a sub-$300 Canadian price range.

My [Moto 360 Gen 1](http://www.motorola.ca/products/moto-360-gen-1) is dying and I've been wanting to get myself a proper watch for my upcoming birthday. I have no idea where to start, could someone point me to a place where I can browse for watches around the $200-$300 CAD price range? I've mostly just been looking on Amazon in order of popularity so far.

Additionally, I'd appreciate any recommendations at all (first time buying a proper watch that costs more than $50 so I have no idea what to look for). If it helps, [this is the watchface I used most recently on the 360](https://youtu.be/MQTGYdhPwN0).
Yes, but past that, they have quotas so less popular programs will be easier to get into.

It really depends on the job, but in general I would say that you should take 369 and 373 (assuming they're not mandatory for you) because they teach you concepts you'll probably have to apply, including synchronous programming and various algorithms.

I eventually spent a few hours commuting to the one store the website said still had stock (only because I had ordered it when there was a substantial discount). The guy at the store said they'd been out of stock for weeks, weren't expecting new stock, and didn't know why the website was showing the product. I'm assuming that means they cancelled the order.
Good catch, sorry!

 This was on sale when I ordered it. However, it wasn't available at the store closest to me so I went in and placed and order, hoping that they would move one from one of the other stores that had stock. After waiting for around a month (went in a few times and they had no updates), I decided to go in-person to the last store their website indicated had stock. Turns out they hadn't had stock anywhere ("website glitch") since around the time I had ordered but none of their staff felt it was necessary to tell me this during the multiple trips I made to the store to check on status (or when replying to the emails I sent to their customer support).

Trying to move on from a G700 and am deciding between a Deathadder and a G502, any recommendations for either? The G700 has developed a double-click issue after 3ish years of use and though I've taken it apart tonight to fix it, it's probably a good idea to get a new mouse soon.
Do you have to buy the metropass for all 12 months to get the credit?
It could be useful, but I wouldn't expect it to be common. You could always tell the interviewer you haven't taken that course yet, I did that even for a 263 question (did my PEY interviews at the beginning of second year) and still got the job.
He said *during* PEY, so he'd already be past the interview stage at that point. To answer your question though, I found that my interviews did delve into 263 but not into 373.
369 will help you understand multithreading, which may be useful for your PEY. 373 is interesting, but not necessarily directly useful if you're already familiar with basic algorithms. Both require some work though so be prepared for that.
me too thanks
1440p?
Yup, this course feels like a huge waste of time. At this point, I'm only in it because dropping now would feel like a waste. The random mark schemes with no clear comments make it hard to even judge what final marks will be like.
I suppose it's dependent on what "dev work" in this case means, but a dual core (and lack of GPU) can be constraints in some instances.
To be fair, VS Code is more like Sublime or Atom than the regular VS.
>As for windows? It lacks a lot of the terminal based usability of Linux and OSX

I'm hoping this continues to change as Microsoft improves on the windows subsystem for linux. We could really use some more competition for dev-related machines. The new macbooks have basically guaranteed that you'll have to buy at least the 15" model for dev work.
I was thinking the same, though sadly I think the closest we'll get to that is the phase shift ability.
Yes, but the shield tablets using the same (or very similar) tech were of a similar price when they launched (might have been a little less actually).
I've been using that ability way to much since unlocking it in MP.
The issue is that those 13000 are further broken down into server regions so your choice is very limited. This wouldn't be as much of an issue if we had dedicated servers, for example.
PC gamers aren't used to good games? 

I bought it on PC and while it's a good game, it has a serious population problem one day after launch.
Not if you bought an Origin key via third party. So both are right.
Shouldn't hurt your chances, though the credit stuff we were talking about in the other thread is irrelevant in your case.
I agree with math (137 particularly has some interesting proofs not covered by HL math), but would disagree with forfeiting CS credits. I personally found the knowledge (in HL CS) to have been sufficient to get me to at least 209 without missing out on anything significant.
I'd second this, 41 is a great score for admission. You'd also get first year transfer credits for your HL courses since (I'm assuming) you got 5+ on them.
Macbooks are actually quite popular for development.

You can always wait for reviews to come out before preordering if you really want to preload. (Yes, I know there are games with really late embargoes but you can decide if it's worth the risk on an individual basis in those cases.)
How flimsy is typing on the keyboard cover? That's the only thing putting me off of the pro line. I don't want to have to carry a laptop and a tablet to class.

How much battery does the Surface Book give you in practice? I've been thinking of picking one up.
It's really fun when your squad actually uses voice to communicate and play the objective. Too bad it only happens once per a thousand games.
Just tried to contact support and they refused, saying I should ask the manufacturer instead. However, they did offer me a $20 coupon (valid for 90 days) instead.
Ah, I didn't know who the actual writers were in the game (and haven't played BLACK). I realize it's completely subjective, but I've generally enjoyed the COD campaigns more than BF in the years they release together. Maybe it's just that BF seems to take itself too seriously for the premise of its plot, BC2 was fun (again, IMO) *because* it was more lighthearted. I'm still hopeful for BF1 though, they have a more unique setting this time and I really hope they can pull off a truly memorable story. WW1 has tons of truly horrifying stories actually available to us and I hope they can pull off an exploration of its history rather than an action-flick trying to be serious about its story.

>The trick with Battlefield and Call of Duty is that you have two teams. The big team blows 75% of the budget making a story-driven campaign. 

I realize that, and I guess I don't completely understand it. Titanfall was criticized for not having a campaign in part because it was a $60 release, I don't think this would've been as big of an issue if they had priced it a bit lower, at $40 (for the initial value proposition) or added a bit more depth the multiplayer. I guess the real reason for the SP in these games is that at the end of the day, it probably offers a good ROI for them (I'd imagine SP would be a compelling part of selling the game to a new player).

EDIT: To address your edit, I completely agree with your point. A game like Hardline probably should've been marketed without the Battlefield name. I realize that it was done for brand recognition, but the MP fans didn't really pick it up and more may have discovered its story if it wasn't marketed as a Battlefield game. 

>You could rename the Metro games as "Call of Duty: Metro" and suddenly people would be making all sorts of claims about the game's quality.

I'd argue that would be because CoD and BF are primarily MP-focused games and a large part of the audience isn't picking it up for the story.
While I agree with your points, I think the reason a lot of "vocal" fans don't talk about Battlefield's SP (specifically BF3 and BF4) is that the writing/plot was almost horribly bad and completely forgettable. As a fan of the series, I've felt that if they're going to continue to invest little in writers in further games, then they should scrap the SP campaign (and maybe make the game cheaper, but I would guess that BF is relatively price-inelastic among the "hardcore" fans), or at least make it less of a priority. At the end of the day, Battlefield still sells primarily for its multiplayer and those are the players that'll continue to invest in the game (particularly via DLC/Premium, which are completely MP-focused).
Idk about most, bit that definitely want always the case. In fact, Google own apps had some.
A lot of the time, designers and developers do want to follow the spec but users may find that something going against the spec is working better for them. That's part of the reason some apps had bottom bars to begin with (back when they weren't part of the spec).
The permission dialog comes with the API though, unless they have a custom one as well
Oh, I did check that. There's no visible strain on either the slot or the card (the slot itself is steel-reinforced). I was more worried about that having damaged the individual connections on the inside (not sure how a PCI-E slot looks from the inside so I wasn't sure if there were physical barriers between each of the "pins". However, since everything outside of gaming has been fine so far, I concluded that it was probably fine.
>did you check the pcie connector? that sounds a bit painful. 
 
Wasn't sure what to check, so I just set it up and hoped for the best.

>also in the nvidia control panel, you might want to set power preferences to maximum performance instead of the default one, that might help.  

Didn't think of that, will try it out.

FFS, so I posted earlier about Canada Computers not shipping (in-store) an item 3 weeks after ordering and it turns out it's because they decided to order from MSI instead of moving one from one of their other stores that already had stock.
[There's a Surface deal running right now](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-ca/for-students), thinking of picking one up myself actually.
Ordered one last Wednesday and it arrived yesterday. It went from California to BC to Toronto and was delivered by Canada Post.
Ordered a mobo in-store from Canada Computers more than 2 weeks ago now and it still hasn't come in (despite other stores having stock until recently). :/
Isn't that illegal?
They come in stock at Newegg pretty often (actually in stock at the time of posting this).
lol, regrets setting in seeing this. Ordered the non oc strix from Newegg yesterday and the oc version is cheaper here
If Canada Computers has a deal that ends on Thursday, according to their website, will it end at 12AM or 11:59PM?
Similar story here, ordered an item on Tuesday and it was here by Thursday.
Newegg seems to be raising prices. The Gaming X was $560 3 weeks ago and is $620 now.
Yeah, same. I literally saw the price rise every day after it went out of stock but held out thinking it would get cheaper...and now here we are.
Not really a deal, this was $40ish cheaper a month ago
I've been checking ebates from time to time and have only ever seen 1%, not sure how everyone here seems to snag 4%.
Guess I'll be waiting for Newegg stock and will go with whoever gets it first.
looks like they don't have those cards in stock, you'll probably get an email soon if you haven't already
Yes, it doesn't come with a stock cooler and not having one will kill your CPU pretty quickly.
The surface book is also quite good, though it's even more expensive.
Thoughts on shoprbc? I ended up getting tired of getting double minded every time Newegg got stock and ended up ordering the non oc strix 1070 from there

I might just jump on that gigabyte card if prices don't come down soon
Does that version also come with the different modes they advertise (silent below 60C, etc)?
Not sure what you mean, I've been using the TD app for months and it didn't ask me for any special SIM (though maybe by "special" you mean a Canadian carrier?).
Wait, does this one still come with the three modes they advertise on the other one (gaming, silent, OC) or is it cheaper because those have to be set manually?
Does anyone have experience buying a GPU from Amazon US? Depending on how much we actually have to pay in import fees, it [might end up being cheaper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GXOX3SW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) than the [CAD prices] (http://www.ncix.com/detail/msi-geforce-gtx-1070-twin-76-132423.htm).

Well yeah, but I would think that not honoring their revised LWD policy could cause more lawsuits than something subjective like the strike.
I thought the provost had promised not to penalize for LWD due to the current situation.
For some reason, I commonly experience sleep paralysis but have never seen anything horrific. I usually just end up focusing on waking up again.
Is there any way for Pro users to get the Dev version without having to pay again?
> Not flat out- I HATE HUMANITY!!! EVERYONE MUST DIE!!!!

That's exactly what Hatred is trying to be though.
I used to be a huge Battlefield fan but got burned out by BF4's rocky launch. Considering all the praise I've been hearing recently, is it worth picking up again?
> **Why wages? I’ve heard my TAs make $42 / hour; isn’t that a lot?**
Taken out of context this seems like a lot of money. What is left out of the discussion is the fact we 
have about 205 hours of work per year; sometimes much less. After the university skims $8,500 for 
tuition, our take-home pay (when added to our stipends) is roughly $15,000: nearly $10,000 under the 
official poverty line. Once we are past our 5th year we are out of the funded cohort. This means we pay 
full tuition for a few meetings with our committees and a library card. In effect, we’re paying tuition for 
the right to work as TAs. 
Sessional course instructors make approximately a third of what permanent faculty make despite holding 
the same credentials and teaching the same courses as tenured professors.
I got the impression (from the beta) that the campaign will be more like Titanfall's in that it's just a group of more scripted multiplayer games. I believe they said that the outcome of each match will determine how the story progresses.
Does anyone know of a Mexican proxy ip that's working? I can't get Hola or other IPs via Google to work today.
Thanks! I was thinking of picking up the cheapest DVD drive I could find because I don't think they would need it all that often.
[Spoiler](#s "Elise mentions that she knew her father was a Templar and Arno's an Assassin from the start and was raised to follow her father's footsteps.")
I was looking forward to another AC2-type game after the initial setup, which, as you say, seems to be a lesser copy of Ezio's origins. 
I agree with your spoilers, there was zero explanation given for [Spoiler](#s "his appearance is the Assassin stronghold at the end of the game"). 

It also seems that some characters like Napolean where much more emphasized in trailers than in the actual story, [Spoiler](#s "considering the only somewhat important thing Napolean did was to take the piece of Eden") I feel like they could return to Paris/France and develop the story more (and maybe have fewer bugs).
They've removed it from the store after the massive traffic from/r/gamedeals.

Good luck, you could also try to move a finger. I usually "test" all of my fingers and toes to test which one I can move.
You could try [this](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/192147/changing-the-games-text-language-to-english).
Ive experienced sleep paralysis and use the toe technique. I don't think I've ever actually dreamed through it.
You can also just add it to your path variable.
I believe they're using a new engine this time.
They used to last two years before this pack was introduced (not sure about now).
I've been interested in getting Elite for some time now. Is there any indication as to whether it will be on Steam in the near future?

Additionally, is it fun to play with an xbox controller?
You can also download Office 2013 Professional Plus and sign in with your UofT account.
Yes, I forced it to use the GPU via the nVidia control panel.
Just so you know, AC ran absolute shit on my 750m.
The distinction here is that Muslims do not believe Jesus to be the son of God.
Thanks, that's exactly why I was asking.
Just wanted to know.
It lists several courses, out of which 2.5 FCEs are needed. Some of those are 400 level courses.
[Check here.] (http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/course/timetable/1213_fw/step-4-check-your-start-time)
Yeah, I was a little confused about that. Is there any ETA?
I'm going to be a second year student (have already completed most second year courses except stats and anything that requires it). This timetable is mostly based on AI focus, but I also took CSC343 because I have heard that it is beneficial when applying to PEY.
Thanks!
Would this tutorial also enable me to get root in the process?
Awesome, thanks!
Battlefield 4 had a female character in the singleplayer, seemingly for no reason other than to use it as a marketing point over COD.
As would I.
I think he means a violin made of ants.
I know, that's why I asked.
I asked Ubisoft support via 3 different methods and all of them said that it's not region/language locked.
In not in it myself, but you would apply after first year. Coop students have to do s year long course before they can get a placement.

I'd recommend you pick UTSC because it has a better reputation than UTM.
UofT is typically very slow to reply, I got my acceptance in the last possible week. You would be able to switch into coop after first year.
Yes, and I'm saying this from my sad experience (had a 90+ avg but a calc mark of 80).

It varies from year to year though so you might have better luck.
Nope, though you could always switch into UTSG from one of the other campuses if you do well in your first year.

Yup, Origin does tend to do that. I had first asked EA support about the RU version of Watch_Dogs and the rep told me that it's likely only in the Russian language. However, in this case, I would think that Ubisoft is a more accurate source.
I actually asked Ubisoft and they said that keys are not region locked and should therefore work fine in terms of language.

Ah, thanks! There's no concept of summer semesters at UTSC so I was a bit confused.
As someone from UTSC planning on taking 209, does "two semesters" mean that it goes from May to August?
Thanks!
Spoiler tags man.
I have been told that it is likely an event from this weekend's episode.
Happened to me too, but I'm sorta happy that the event in the spoiler happens.
