Hyundai today they stack cars at dealership too! üòÇ
New car, the driver was probably not used to the size where about the bumper.
I‚Äôm feeling like a car noob right now... I have no idea what are you guys talking about. üòÖ
I have been doing that every time I full up at Petro Canada.

However I have recently oil change myself with Pennzoil Ultra Premium 0w20 with WIX oil filter. Very smooth.
Average speed is 80kph 
The computer shows the overall since start of the engine. The accurate one with the one with the bar that moves around or the one analog mpg meter at the front dash.
+ still running on winter tires in 18c temp... like an idiot.

Would I hit low 5L/100KM without all those accessories? My car can pretend to be a Prius.
I use WIX oil filter, same as NAPA probably one of the best filter for Subaru. Proper PSI pressure

OEM is made by FRAM which I don‚Äôt trust .
I don't see UTO2 is required for me, looks like I only need SU2. Please let me know how much is the SU2. :)
I've been waiting for this, I have JVC M730BT running without this for months. I am using another module for music controls that's about it.

- Dynamic Reverse Guidelines
- Volume speed control
- Built-in engine check.

I notice now it needs SU2 instead of SU1. SU1 was so limited in features.
Second of all, no snow doesn't mean you have traction on -1c road surface. Wheel rubber become like hockey puck. People don't understand driving in the winter think they can fly without snow or ice. Even with cold tires on, your rubber is not sticky like in summer.
Yes it is well known, stop right when they say mail you the key. That is 100% scam.
Many reason I love hatchback. I can sit or camp behind.

Updates: It's 400 crashes now.
Plane turns into drift mode then fly away.
Many did but also many don't have winter tires to begin with. When the ice hit the surface, it is an ice ring for everyone even with my cold tires on.
Order food delivery. Come on :)
Yes, don't go out if you don't have to! 400 crashes reported!

Valid, games with smooth locomotion I got motion sickness and to deal with it I have to simulate myself jogging or shake rattle my head as I move.
Yeah I definitely need this. I have so much worry I might throw my controllers and it is also annoying getting on and off with the wrist strap. 
I know hyperblue is still the blue :) not Rally one of course
Where is your second pair?

Curious, but I have CarPlay. Most new vehicles are starting to equip with CarPlay / Android Auto starting 2018+
Pop the cover, wrap it with carbon texture vinyl with heat gun / hair dryer if you don't have one.

Speaking of which... I should do it on mine now... why didn't I think of this until now!
He's living the dream!
Mine doesn‚Äôt have leather. Either burning BBQ on my hand in the summer or it feels like driving with IcePak in my hand in the winter.

My choice is either leather wrap with stitches or swap the entire wheel.
Man, I can‚Äôt imagine stuck in downtown traffic for hours with standard. 
Should always tow to your known car dealership recommendation or insurance recommendation. Never let the guy who tow tells you things and out fears into you.
10min done probably won‚Äôt drain the oil to the last drop. 

I change oil myself and there is a different in term of car performance. If your car needs 0w20 some end up putting cheaper oil or 5w30 into your car for lower cost and put 5000km on it return date. More money for them. My car factory is 10000km per oil change with proper 0w20 oil. 

DIY is recommended since you know what you are putting into your car.
Same problem, I stood in the stadium for 5min waiting to connect. I gave up and continue on my tv series Walking Dead.

Someone did swapped a WRX into XV Crosstrek.

This is probably 2nd or 3rd owners did a swap on XV.
Lastpass switched to Bitwarden, free and it has been much better. $12 for additional feature like Authenticator built right into it.
Pretty much a hybrid built in roll cage but not visible like those on track car.
I‚Äôll buy that fin off you. :)
omg... :c I mean they are lazy enough to rehash old game into VR but lazy on VR controls / tracking support... really?
I have the same speakers bought 6 years ago and today it is still the best THX speakers. I am using it on my TV today for music streaming.
I know this is VIVE sub but does this affects Roomscale in Oculus as well? I was about to buy this game.
Don‚Äôt forget to snowdrift.
Is this run on Steam API for VR?
I think they want to have 24hrs battery life on a single charge.
About 20-30% different, I have 1080 Max-Q here. The only time you won‚Äôt notice if the game decked out at 120hz gsync.
Many reasons now is about $90 at Toronto for oil change I can DIY for $50 with WIX and Pennzoil Ultra Premium 0w20. I have Fumoto 108N which I don‚Äôt even need tools to change oil.

Second, every time I go in dealership to service a warranty part... I have to tell them do not wash after service and they look at me like ‚Äúwhhhyy? It‚Äôs freee‚Äù ... NOPE to that brush on my paint... 
Look up https://tepui.com/

The hardshell is expensive.
OEM Steering and all USB ports are retained. You need the adapters which cost $5-15. Look up http://www.metraonline.com

The lobster claw taillight? :)

Oh you can‚Äôt unseen it now!
Yeah, depends on the area. I have a huge vertical dent line on the passenger side already. Someone just push something against my door but no scratch or paint chip. I found out on the time I clay and wax my car. ;( some people just suck or jelly.

I know that feeling that some lift Jeep almost hit its door edge to my car windows. Lol
It‚Äôs a love and hate thing, got to sacrifice something :) I rather not have door dings.
Not even sure where or who came up Silicone Valley 2.0. I visited Vancouver about half a month ago from Montreal to Toronto and to Vancouver. I will tell you Vancouver is not even close to anything compare to Toronto mega city... Toronto here has been called several time called Silicone Valley North.
Short and why? 
I have similar problem debating if I should sell my winter tires set and stock set to get Method + AT tires because the method set is expensive.
Get JVC M730BT, CarPlay + Android Auto... Forget Bluetooth that is the old school now. Make sure you update the firmware.
I have Asus laptop with 7700HQ 1080 Max-Q and it doesn‚Äôt have iGPU. Smart move Asus
Can‚Äôt wait for Oculasis! Community hub!
Mine filling me in what is binocular overlap?
I saw the movie yesterday too. 
If the HMD got over 110 degree, I would lose sense of real life environment. Like I will even forget I‚Äôm at home. 

As soon I take it off... oh I‚Äôm back to this work life.
Like I said, they are trying to run it like phone business, HTC phone cost $100 to make in China... sell it like a premium at iPhone level.
You can buy a whole setup Oculus + Touch just under $500. Add $60 for a third sensor for roomscale. You're good to go for any games.
Gamers are smarter than consumers who buy $1000 phone yearly. What is HTC thinking? lol They clearly don't understand the gaming market.
HTC... phone company trying to run VR like a fucking phone business. That is not going to work.
For business, you need this license. https://www.vive.com/us/enterprise/

Low sales on games because the library isn't big as flat screen games. Secondly VR requires 1060GPU + power with decent CPU. Not everyone has this $1500 CAD base rig to start with. Most runs on Apple MacBook Pro or just fancy sub $1000 laptop; those can only dream to run VR.


For VIVE Arcades, dev, pro and commercial price is here: https://www.vive.com/ca/enterprise/ VIVE Pro base expect $2000 CAD min. $1600 CAD for VIVE v1.0 already.

The VIVE Pro for consumer + $450, is really for consumers... just no..
?????????????????
It's 35%. The back windows or rear windows can be tinted as dark you want. For example, some van don't even have windows at the back storage.
Same... 


Fuck!

Actually felt bad to begin with, BestBuy Canada charge taxes while Oculus doesn't. I got ripped off with taxes.
A blue lobster... I‚Äôm hungry :)
Very nice but this is classic for me now since I play in VR.
If you order on Oculus, it‚Äôs free shipping and tax free for Canada. I got my Sensor exactly $79 CAD no less or more.

The price is probably included.

I bought my Oculus Touch kit from best buy and I regret it as soon I found out no tax and free ship from Oculus store..... 

Best Buy charged taxes and environment fee on top... dam ripoff.

Bestbuy has the no return policy :(
Look up to disable SPUD in oculus. This will get rid of Mura 
Before I have 3 sensors, I sat on my computer chair to spin around as I play Lone Echo. All you need is your arm movement. Also it helps if you get motion sickness for first timer.
Can we not bash the VR industries, all of them are progressing and innovating. It takes time for tech especially flexible display. We are all under 1% of the maker of VR user... a war already started...

Just enjoy what we have and have fun. 

What it feels back in the day Apple II the only game I play all day is the snake game on the black green monitor.

Curious, if Subaru finally offer Turbo for Crosstrek... I wonder how many of you would trade-in for it. Who's in?
That's a first ... to hear plugging too many USB kills your motherboard. Probably your computer is not grounded properly to begin with.
Running same laptop with Oculus Rift Touch, I have no performance issues and almost games are maxed out. Sounds like misconfigurations and driver firmware need some cleanup and updates.

Do a refresh on Windows 10.
I can't pull the windows out without a [ ! ] square. I am running on Laptop with GTX 1080 Max-Q. Apparently this is a known issue with laptop how it works with the Windows 3D space... weird.
I‚Äôm driving 140kph on a curvy gravel road. ;) anywho I have bad experiences with Android OS
Yes and no but Apple iOS hasn't crash as much as my Nexus 4, Motorola X Play, Samsung S5 Neo that map and etc always crash while I am driving. Can't afford to have map crash out behind the wheel and force hard reboot the phone. I'm done with that, mate. Don't want to put my life at risk.
Guys, where can I find the source of this screenshot or the video? It's not on Oculus youtube channel.


Same, going to push them to get it... friend and family are all far away from me.
Keep it up Oculus!
Well launching VIVE Pro right on tax return season. All your taxes refund now belong to HTC!
I see Oculus model is going to be successful as Apple, all about improving user experiences with innovation in software first. Always design hardware for the software development. Meanwhile HTC all into technical spec but really nothing show that will improve the experiences than just adding cost. Pretty much like Android phones. Well it's HTC afterall... of course.
Wait... are those .. adult diapers?
If trackpad happens, we riot!
Keep it up with tech software development! I love seeing these new stuff than hardware. It feels good that what we have worth every pennies.
Time to invest into dash cam, you will find good ones on Amazon Canada for $99 with rear and front. Make sure you get the one is capacity base instead of battery because we have cold weather here those battery will get destroyed.

Battery is for saving the video as soon you shut off the car.
That never came to my mind... now I will giggle every time someone does it.
Thanks for the correction. 
VIVE price haven‚Äôt dropped over here yet but to be honest Touch + 3 Sensor (360) just under $600 CAD is a great choice and experiences to have. 

VIVE requires a large play space like the size of a standard full size kitchen area. 

Oculus Sensor works in small to medium up to large with third Sensor. To me this is the best choice and flexible setup. It is more portable with built in stand and add selfie stick to extend the height when needed. There is no wall mounting.
Basement is always going to be cold, no matter how much the landlord crank it up 25-26c. Because that is way too hot up stairs floor and above.

My family big house has it set to 24'c basement is still chill 18'c no matter what you do.

Get a space heater, you're only going to be using it in the winter.
Someone fapped too much in the back seats and they did not bother to clean it for years.

I can't say, all come from the same refineries and each brand has it own additive or winter gas.

I tested run with my car with 2 month per brand, this is a 6 months test.


- Esso - Engine rough idle, engine rev slow and I had to push it. Gas range is ~700KM @ 60L tank.


- Shell - Engine no rough idle, very responsive rev. Gas range is ~780KM @ 60L tank.


- Petro-Canada -  Engine no rough idle, small chance dip in RPM, very responsive rev. ~750KM @ 60L tank. (Sunco brand)


The range is calculate on a straight long 600KM trip on Trans-Canada Highway.


I know there is a loyal point system that keep many people to stick with gas brand. Ever since I got a CC with 2% on gas, I could careless about brand point system. Esso phone app authorize pump and payment is very nice but I could let that go.


@OP Costco / Loblaws gas is probably Suncor brand as well.
Let's hope maybe they can give us free ride if we offer them a homemade coffee as long they don't rush us.
Is the new SkyrimVR has free locomotion? I am not too fond of teleportation because it makes it feel like a gallery game.
With the market 0.28% overall VR. Making a move to new HMD hardware to replace CV1 over software / content is not that feasible since they R&D development maybe haven‚Äôt cover yet. And by adding extra cost for a small margin leap in improvement is a no go, I wouldn‚Äôt spend another $200+ for small upgrade to be honest. For new users probably good but 2 years in with the entire market 0.28% the focus direction need to be more on experiences to attract new users. Most newbie 99% don‚Äôt know or care into technical area. Same goes for pc gamer who build their own PC is only small % compare to world computer users base.

It‚Äôs more feasible if they plan to release new VR experiences such as new glove, new tracker for legs or accessories to augment the experiences more. They need to grow the experiences. Maybe develop a new steering mounting for the touch controller for racing. Like Nintendo is doing for the Switch with cardboards. 

I‚Äôm a very technical person, love GHZ, Mbps, CPU speed, 120Hz 144Hz Gsync geek stuff. When I put on my HMD, I could careless about the SDE or resolution and I know it is only make it hard to read some tiny text if the game is on text base. But for games like Sprint Vector, Lone Echo; I take the experiences over technical things. I just want more and more fun experiences as long it track all movement accurately.
Subaru Tank.
I know how that's feels, it sounds like just a chipmunk beeeeep... seriously for the whole time I wonder if they even notice I horned at them.
I like to see the new Ascent with:

- Rally Mud flaps

- Hella Horns

- Add some offroad hella light / lightbars

- Nameless catback exhaust

- Method Wheels

- Giant roll cage

- Lots of stickers

How is your temp on your CPU? I have ASUS GX501 here already run cool 75'c GPU and 80'c with undervolt. Stock I sit at 85-90'c on CPU and 80'c on GPU.

Highly try undervolt your CPU to reduce heat to avoid throttling and no performance drop but you gain consistent CPU Ghz without a dip.

Thanks for the PDF! Glad the industries headed this way. I am really tired of console war and console exclusive. I was scared that VR market would fall into the same world. Which what prevent me from buying VR for nearly 2 years.

I know Oculus market platform is exclusive to Rift but major games on Oculus is also available on Steam or standalone. There is Revive third party enable to play games on Oculus to VIVE.

There is no point segmenting the market where the entire VR market is merely 0.28% lol good luck for making things exclusive; basically you shoot yourself in the foot.
First glance at the title ... it made me think of Oculus and HTC decide to have budget cut on employees and layoff. 
$1000 for Canadian without taxes... so am I looking at $2000 CAD for a full set? No thanks.

I rather spend that on a good PC and spend $600 top for VR. Oculus which it is!
They added High Performance CPU option, you see more interactable physic objects.
I think I need to wipe my firefox profile and start over. Something might have corrupted those files.
Selling base on hardware spec won‚Äôt last, Oculus sell on experiences and creativities is what most people crave for. Isn‚Äôt VR is all about experiences?

Same reason I buy car base on the experience I want from the car lowly 200-305HP. I don‚Äôt give a bat crap about 600HP muscle car that car any go straight without crashing.
If it gets too hot, just pass it to me. I have a cooler here. üòé
I need friends on Oculus world :( - tag: Mito.Zo
Already spent $20 CAD (Oculus Credit) on the duo pack, love Sprint Vector but not too fond of EVE Valkyrie... it‚Äôs nice for some shoot up multiplayer but I rather stick to Elite Dangerous for the long run.

Aside from that I cannot wait for Oculus anniversary, I have many games on wish list... since I‚Äôm only a month ownership of Oculus VR. My library is just a bunch of freebies. I have Lone Echo on day one that got me to get VR. 

I wish Oculus can also design iOS or Android app for their library and store. So I could check it out when I am not home lol

Wish list:
- Arizona Sunshine
- The Climb
- Job Simulator
- Unknightly
They are originate from SpeedLine website ship from Taiwan and made in Taiwan. I‚Äôve been running them for almost 3 years. No burn out etc, good quality!
A lot of VR games are physic heavy now. 
Disable Fast Start?
Depends which vendor, my 8GB GTX 1080 Max-Q is supported.
Battery life is not a problem, it get charged fast up to 80% every time I use my car for 15min.
I'm pretty sure that the door drain, water slip between the windows seals.
$20 for Canadian.

I am curious how would you know if it is a mistake? Are you from Nvidia internal, ranting?
A lot of drivers were going at normal speed and it is hard for them to instantly change lane and run back to help. Let alone adding the freeze of making decision if they can help or too late I passed it.

Check the VSauce on YouTube about people making choice using 1 deaths over 5 deaths accident. People froze and they have no idea what to do. It calls trolley problem.

It‚Äôs a phycological thing.

Yeah... the movement / view and aim all on my left thumb...

Check if you have coin mining malware eating your cpu 
I hope oculus one day start to invest into foldable display that can curve around each eyes to increase the FOV.

The right eye right now can see the left screen if there is no wall at the nose point or the lenses redirect the vision. 

A curve display curve out from the nose point vertically then around the eye radius then curve back to the side of the eye can increase the horizontal FOV dramatically then use a lenses to correct the side display.

Basically each eye has a curve display.

They said the USB 3 controller cannot handle more data long ago. Not sure about today... I have USB 3.1 Gen 2 with Thunderbolt 3 support.
When you place it beside a black leather potato couch. It blends in...
Yes, shopping at Oculus online was easy and fast. It only took 3 days from US to Canada. I love the fact they understand our struggles to keep up with other product users. So much accessories to spend to get the same experiences.
The glares? That's normal... in very dark place with a bright object.
I almost had 360 perfect with 2 sensors, a lot of testing and tweaking. Not just placing them opposite but one high up and one low down.
Colour band is for visibility, people won't accidentally walk into it.
I took my old pair of glasses and removed the arms... stick into the VR with sticky thumbtack. $1 from Dollar Store.
Holy molly details... again holy sh!t... so detailed and sharp! How? I thought I was looking at the Google Map Sat view in 3D next gen.
If you never plan to turn off the computer at night. Best to just unplug the headset USB only so there won‚Äôt be any power because it will keep running the proximity sensor and you can feel the warm touch at the top.
>If you are using an Nvidia GPU and currently experiencing display or performance issues with your Oculus Rift, please make sure you're using driver version 388.59. Later versions may cause compatibility issues with Oculus software.

Quote from: https://support.oculus.com/
Driver issues, old GeForce cards doesn‚Äôt work well with VR not solely because it lack of performances. VR needs a lot of bandwidth.

Right now the beta Oculus Core 2.0 has a performance dip in games . They recommend to keep old 388.xx driver.

SteamVR crash for me as well random time. I could not get to finish playing The Lab, it crashes every time the robot get into the room. 

I have a GTX 1080 Max-Q
Why not consider using silicon to seal those gap where sweat might leak into.
Please make option for locomotion choices. Especially with touch controller we have the thumb stick to move our position instead of teleporting.
Old AMD GPU stuttering issues ah the memories.
Problem some games with no stories are costing more than $30 is a hard deal. Lone Echo with 8 hours story gameplay at $45 CAD is deep. A $30 would have been reasonable.

$60 game of the story can be long as 30hours gameplay like Mass Effect Trilogy series each 45hours gameplay for me on record. Good deal.

If pancake games cost like $50 CAD I‚Äôve seen... Nope
Oculus left has a tilt left issue lol looking at the launch of the game in the video seems like I‚Äôm not the only one.
Check your setup, get rid of mirrors or reflective . Reduce the sunlight into your play space . Get some cheap selfie stick to raise your Sensor height. Look for selfie stick that has bottom mounting point.
I have tons of steam games 200 in my library but only 2 purchased game support VR and the other free pancake Valve free game more like demo. 

90% I pull game from Oculus Home library which is fun and well made games. Content wise for VR is on Oculus side.
Both has pros and cons, to Rift with Touch has more pros. Even adding a third Sensor for roomscale is still cheaper than VIVE. You can add a 4th Sensor for extreme coverage lol. As of right now both VR can add more support for attachment.

I am looking forward for Sensor wrap around my ankle so I can have feet in game to do some kicking in robot recall.
Lone Echo and Robo Recall. I did try bullettrain ar first... my impression was jaw dropping I can dodge like Neo in the Matrix. I have never need to move that much in gaming. Not even Wii.

Robo Recall can be hard lol I wish it has a locomotion move like on controller FPS.
Toronto here also looking for a set. Rift now I am using my old pair of glasses; unscrewed the arms and fit into it with thumbtack sticky gum that‚Äôs hold it for now.
SteamVR is buggy. Crash too much to be playable. Really glad I have Oculus Home. 
It takes time to get used to it. I get fatigue because of the long day at work on top.

YOUSHUDGO, people needs you.
Mine is like... Sea Salt Lake. I actually like this one cover the gas lever... mine doesn't so it gets all the rock and salt stuck inside the level part.
I had the debate and I choose to weight on contents > price > quality > ease to use.

Contents, games I play mostly don‚Äôt have roomscale especially game involve with car, spaceship dash. Roomscale is a plus addition features and I know Oculus needs 3 sensors for full roomscale. It can work with two sensors but you get some jittery sometime.

So looking at the price out of the box Oculus is still cheaper with 3 sensors than Vive. Both can do exactly the same at this level.

Oculus quality has improved so much on CV1 vs DK2. The visual lenses is slightly ahead of VIVE. Both had minimal SDE but Oculus has a lot of glares in dark environments. I don‚Äôt mind too much.

Oculus is easier to setup and Sensor has built in stand without needing to buy tripods or mounting to every building I bring it to. Cost extra here.

Oculus Sensor can extend the height, I just buy the selfie stick with both end attachable screw. $14 per stick not bad compare to $50 tripod.

Oh yeah I don‚Äôt like Facebook, but what can you do? At least they have major fund support for the big business.

HTC phone company. ü§î

+ Oculus Rift, you can play game from Oculus Home and Steam games without needing a third party hack around to run it.
What is Dash 2.0? Core 2.0? 

I am having a lot of issues with Core 2.0 that is causing performance drop in game. Apparently I learned that the Oculus Home is still running in the background while a game is launched. Highly possible the Oculus Home in Core 2.0 is having memory leak if the app did closed at game launch. 
ASUS Zephyrus GX501 get ready to pay up and starve for months.

Day 3 experience with Lone Echo in Oculus Rift + Touch. I am having problem with real life cooperate flat screen. I kept having a sense that I am still wobbling around like in VR... or am I in real life VR? Halp!
Wow, I did not know that. I will try it out by returning back to release one instead.
I heard a lot of problems with USB 3.0 not just sensors. This happened on my mouse and keyboard that they randomly cutout on my old X79 rig. It was annoying and I had to switch down to 2.0 to fix the issue. Something is not right with 3.0 power or controller. Now my laptop has USB 3.1 better but still have some flaw. 

Router wifi 2.4Ghz do affects your USB 3.0 interference. Not kidding on that, Asus router has it own built in USB 3.0 Interference Reduction on the wifi 2.4ghz setting. 

Speaking of that, my laptop actually sitting 1.5 feet from the router... Time to move it to another room.

I just paid off my student loan one shot and I‚Äôm in my 30s. I contribute to RRSP and etc. To be honest focus paying off your loan as fast you can. It‚Äôs a big weight off your chest then you can start investing with much more flexibility and with a better credit score for applications.
Did you damper around the transmission floor (center console area)? For Crosstrek, the noise come from the centre console and the roof not much from the doors.
I don't know about the 2018 if you can ... upgrade the HUD.

First thing, your infotainment system need to have excellent sound output before your speakers. If you put good speakers, your stock infotainment output poorly. It defeats the purpose.

Mine is 2015, I went to upgrade the infotainment to JVC M730BT with stock speakers. I only boost up the bass in the EQ and turn on DSP audio enhancement. The audio is night and day compare to the stock infotainment system. At this point, not worth getting upgraded speaker but a kicker can still consider. 

What I am trying to say, infotainment upgrade alone can turn night and day experience, good speakers can gain only a bit. Kicker can enhance the bass that's it.
Thank you, now it makes sense on mine. I thought it was for phone stand... but it will fly off as soon I make a turn.

You know news are much better on Reddit than actual news website or TV. Total of # redditors vs 10-20 journalists...  we upvote and downvote fake news like auditing the articles for legibility.

It looks like Ontario plate... can someone confirm?
I wrote the same fact on another post with a snowmobile on top lol.

Yes the weight limit is meant for centre of gravity safety. No different than driving a forklift with a load mid air.

Today car can support an impact and upside down of a 2000lbs (Crosstrek) itself...  it make no senses why the roof is rated 150lbs because it will get bend on the rail? The crossbar do have limit, usually a tent weight is spread out to 2 crossbar at 4 points by the design.
I have Gorillaz, nothing wrong with different branding. Gorilla was more available to ship to Canada. RockBlokz isn't available at the time (2015).

Today, the mudflap is still intact, serve very well in mud and snow. Save my pants from being mud up or salt to work. (Yes, my subie meant to be dirty).

I did back my car into a curb and I did worry it would rip it off my bumper... it didn't. It just made some noises.
New subie can hold up the car upside down and on impact as well. The weight regulation is more for center-of-gravity. The more weight you have at the top, you will likely flip that subie on a turn even with boxer flat 4.

It has a big benefit for Canadian winter or fog. Crosstrek fog only turns on with headlight, this is going to change when Spring comes around, going to run the mod wiring to DRL.
I have a line dent vertical on the passenger side door. I found out on the day I clay bar my Crosstrek. I was ... not impressed. But it's really light, barely visible unless you shine bright line at it. I notice how light and flexible Subaru panels are. Unlike my previous car hard sheet will likely get dent easier (like hailstorm).

When we had 10GB for $60. They are still making tons of money. so 1GB for $55 is 100% legit bullshit. Period. BANDWIDTH ONLY COST ELECTRICITY! It has no VALUE! Bandwidth is generated by end users and delivery/receive!

To begin with, bandwidth should be free! Why we pay ISP for data we created? That I don't understand. Because they want MONEY!
Like Avast, tells you have 12GB junks. You know you don't have 12GB of junks if you are computer savvy.

You need a router with QoS traffic management and this requires higher cpu chip.

Also current router can run on DDWRT or Merlin firmware to improve the traffic management. My latency is always 10ms even I am uploading 4K video from my iPhone.
The new wifi router has QoS traffic management. 
If you have low speed upload it will drag your connection down. Even slow your download. 

Why? Home service is not like commercial line that can transmit data simultaneously two way traffic. Each transmission requires ACK, acknowledge data back to the sender when you request a website data to your modem. So when you maxed out the upload, it cause slower ACK.

It‚Äôs not like morning rush hour traffic. It‚Äôs more a underground metro that both end need to move at the same time.

Welcome to the first world internet problems. Today media really need a min 10Mbps upload. 1Mbps is just piece of junk.

Yes, Hi OCD!
I have CarPlay on my Crosstrek 2015 for a long while (aftermarket). OEM infotainment system sucks bad.
Give or take, living in Mississauga rent $1000-1200 monthly + Car & Home $300 monthly. What I just said is the average. $1300-$1600 range to be living in Mississauga right now but don‚Äôt forget gas $100-200 monthly, car depreciation, maintenance and repair. Winter tires... up to $200-500 yearly. (Base on used car)

You‚Äôre looking at $2000-$2500 to live in Sauga... 

If you don‚Äôt own a car and live in downtown close to work. You‚Äôre better off staying there. Because you‚Äôre going to waste 3 hours per day to work commute vs transit top 1 hr?

I can already tell you this... coming from Montreal. Life is tough :/ yo
He‚Äôs just trying to draw a genital part. I must agree why not do it in an empty parking lot?!?

>:(
First... I‚Äôm screaming at the paint scratch as you put weight and move around! Second what if someone out 230-300lbs on that latch? The bolts arent design to hold that pressure on a single point....
Hatchback has a lot of drags. That drags was pulling the car back while you go forward. You won‚Äôt feel it but engine rev higher on long run. When the crosswind hits the rear diagonally;  it sways without spoiler. Similar drag or cyclone effect behind your car. Spoiler is just to break up that tornado  cyclone effect behind your car. Crosstrek rear is light... it bounces easily over parking lot bumps lol. It‚Äôs very easy for wind to push it off the track.

I highly doubt anyone will experience this because they bought either with spoiler day one. Or without one unless they add one later like I did.

It‚Äôs very noticeable for me because my highway to work is extremely windy. 30-50kph wind crosswind. Pretty much my car is like cutting through a 150-200kph wind.

For sedan, I know many said spoiler is pointless unless you go on high speed over 170kph... they didn‚Äôt take in account if you drive against the wind. Not much use if the wind behind you but the wind already help pushing your car forward.
I fix it both is now same feel and no double click on LMB. I opened it and swap the spring RMB and LMB also bend the spring to increase tension.
1Password also recommended.
bloody mess, car tailpipe will end up puking bloods
Same problem here.
Spoiler on the 13-17 did reduce the dirts. Spoiler was added on a year later. That‚Äôs how I know from summer to winter... oh helps against crosswind on highway greatly! I don‚Äôt have to correct steer against the crosswind anymore.
80% brand component with DI in the new Crosstrek 2018. 152HP smoother engine.
2018 is already Direct Injection not for 13-17 models.
swapping wheels aren't hard at all, just make sure you have a torque wrench.
They are just a bunch of holes.
Same I couldn‚Äôt tell.
The CVT has the pin lock. So without it you can practically shift anytime even the car is off... if you‚Äôre careful that‚Äôs good but if you have kids, you really don‚Äôt want them to shift it accidentally or play with it. Must use your handbrake just like manual.
I stopped because I have no one to play with and unlike MMO you have people around to compete runs but this is missing link. I don't feel the urge to progression at all. All gears random drop can do most things already. What is the point?
I wish I have a wife...
I‚Äôm trying to hold my laugh at work... barely.
Traction Off, VDC was still on (buzz like insane lol). Still manage to gas it 4k+ RPM Gear 1 (seq-manual) and lock your steer to get it spinning https://www.reddit.com/r/subaru/comments/7lzdtv/its_snow_day_again/
Of course, this is why I stop shopping on eBay for 10 years. Too many fake products. I am kind of worry about Amazon as well now.
So did you stop in the middle of the highway to pick it up in the traffic?
I did the same.
BlackVue camera is amazing but expensive. It has the ability to keep recording and auto shut down when the battery drop to a certain voltage.

I guess depends the environment. Here in Winter I took it off for easy rinse and clean. My old Honda Civic'01 had that hood deflector and before I sold it; I found out all the crust, rust or salt was stuck in there for years. It was disgusting...
Deflector is to redirect, bugs, snows, sand, rain off your windshield. Rock fly like projectile... cut through winds so no...

On the 13-17, rock can still hit the edge of the hood regardless you have it on. I got rock chip on the side of the hood.

I actually took mine off for the whole year... it didn't serve any purposes.
Merry Christmas to all!
Can‚Äôt wait so I can have more breakfast finally!
Some car fog lights are the DRL right out of the manufacturer. 
Not all fog lights are glare type. Some do have cutoff just like HID. Some people probably aim up or install some LED bulb that reflect at the bad angle. The bulb spot position is important for reflector housing. 

My just shine low on the road nothing above my headlamp would hit.
25ft and aim down 2in mark. DOT you‚Äôre good.
Those people install LED bulb into reflector lamp. This is what happened, glare AF. If they want to use LED they need to get proper projector. 
I actually do that... and at the red light if my side is angle upward. My headlight would blind the other side even if I have auto tilt light system . I just turn it off until I pass the cars.

Have you check the rotor thickness when you take off the wheels? Just advising you so you don‚Äôt get scam replacing good parts. Depends on your driving habit, rotor can last up to 80,000km
How many KMs on your car? You may only need brake pads change, not the rotor. Whoever tells you need to change the whole thing is BS. Rotors can last x3 longer than your brake pads. Unless you bring it to track day and warp those rotors.

I personally change my brakes myself, very easy job.
MPG or L/100km on mine is pretty accurate as I drive back and for between Montreal and Toronto... I used ¬æ fuel one way and that‚Äôs is 560km distance on the road map. My digital dash was stating a range up to 800km. 800-560 = 240km fuel left. Then I was able to keep driving till I have 50km left and with one bar left on the fuel meter.
Close, but you need a bigger radiator, roof rails, wheel well cladding, bumper swaps and 2013 WRX brake caliper sets. Maybe tranny swap... 1500lbs tow capacity.
In the summer, these guys was also at No Frills lot in Mississauga where the old NCIX is. Except it's a green dark van. He pulled up beside my car and I knew the moment he opens his mouth; I want to drive away but the parking lot is jammed up traffic (worst parking lot).

From GTX 900 series started supporting a much better encoding, GTX 700 was mediocre. GTX1000 series remain unchanged I think, as other stated 2x engine but it also has GDDR5X on higher model.

There is no drastic performance impact, it may lose 1-5fps because it also utilize the VRAM bandwidth as well. Unless the dedicated encoder chip has it own dedicated VRAM which is not possible. A shadow play 5min at 1080p eats 1.9GB. So I would imagine 1.9GB would be in the VRAM before saving it into your hard disk.  

The bigger VRAM on your GPU ie. 11GB allows you to record longer and 4K 60fps.

I think my GTX 1080 Max-Q 8GB GDDR5X can only handle 4K 30fps. I‚Äôm at work so I can‚Äôt confirm.

This is the habit I need to check my car passenger side every time I leave shopping. 

Passenger door has a straight line dent and barely visible.

I notice when I wax my car and sudden disappointed and those buttholes either careless about car or jealous whatever.

Since then I‚Äôve been parking beside luxury cars or subies if I can find one.
I removed mine after one year, only useful against bug because it force the wind to push upward as you hit high speed on highway. But I‚Äôve drove through a field of bugs... doesn‚Äôt seem to help at all. Let alone rock flying at you like a bullet.
Please burn it alive...
My main reason I stay behind the line especially in winter time. I had a car that did not have winter tires almost rear ended into me at red light. I was lucky there was enough room to creek my car forward as the car from behind hard braking at me.

This is why I stay a bit behind until there is a car behind me fully stop. 

I understand light sensor won‚Äôt pickup at some intersection.
Crosstrek is group 34? I thought it was 35
What or which would you recommended? Red Top?, I am considering Yellow Top because of camping and running Aux power with engine off.

Last time I ran it, 810km range on 60L tank. City driving down to 580km range 
With the Bluetooth lag, it is not ideal for gaming. Stick to 2.4G.

I‚Äôve checked mine yesterday still have 50% life at 38k km. Cleaned it a bit but I forgot to buy lub for it.
It‚Äôs scary, I don‚Äôt understand people mentality. Jealousy? I‚Äôm glad I live in Toronto where there are much more expensive car like Ferrari, Lamborghini, bimmer, Mercedes. Old crappy car barely seen. Everyone here has money and more educated. So at least don‚Äôt mess with my Subaru.

Crosstrek still have different components due to tow capacity support over Impreza and height.
I've been using Logitech mouse and keyboard with braided cables for years. I thought it was cool and nice durable but huge annoying downside they are stiff and cause my mouse to move bounce back the cable caught on something.

Never again! Love the Steelseries Rival 310 rubber cable, least better than braided.

**GTA V** here recorded with GFE: https://youtu.be/vQHTmei0SBo
Good one lol, I have no family here.
You need to test on games that has a lot of workshop addons like on Steam games. Skyline Cities is one of them, I had 200 assets.

On a regular GDDR5, took 2.5 min to load everything before I get can into the game.

GDDR5X took 45 seconds... I was shocked when I load it on my 1080Ti card. 

Both card memory has the more or less same Ghz but the GDDR5X has much higher bandwidth.

You can measure that, there is an asset to switch out the loading time for Cities Skyline. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667342976
If I hook it up external display. GDDR5X on 1080 is much faster at loading game with big maps, heavy VRAM games. I had a GDDR5 before the loading speed is noticeable. That test was done on desktop. 

The 1070 only has GDDR5.
I just ran more test, Whisper Mode is not effective or needed on Zephyrus laptop cooling design, the GPU barely able to hit 80'c, Andromeda the GPU runs at 60-70c only. The only thing spin up the fan is the CPU going up...

Thanks Intel...
That's the GTX 1070.

I got GTX 1080, and price matched against Amazon.ca.
That is $4500-$5000 range in Canada. It will be heavier due to the Gorilla glass, Windows Home only, 32GB RAM will add cost, odd position for touchpad. Does it have 120hz?

Also I have trust on ASUS reliable motherboards than other brands.

Also nevermind about the Razer Pro 2... $6000-8000 range ... crazy. Oh the 21 X I heard it was $12,000 in Canada. lol

I'm happy to paid mine $3700 CAD after taxes.
Built many rig in the last decade, :) time for a change.
Whisper mode is off.
**I just recorded this: Andromeda**

I am not sure, I did ran some test. It seems to be lock at 30fps on battery. Nvidia has the Battery Boost FPS cap. But it seems like the BIOS lock it down. 

I am still doing research on it but thank you for bringing this up. This is interesting to know.

Update: the lock depends on the game power demand, for example if playing Starbound 2d games. It will push 60fps at the same power draw as other games 30fps in 3D. GFE will constantly change the game setting every time you plug or unplug it before launching the game. It's weird hacky way.
Someone else done it; fps is great and I wouldn't worry about dip fps since it has GSYNC. That's the benefit of GSYNC, it made me to keep my old GTX TITAN since 2011 because all the games still play butter smooth and low latency. GSYNC is like a long term insurance for your GPU (odd way to put it).

MemoryExpress is good as well, I've bought many things from them to ship it over to Toronto.
I have GTA V... but I need to download it 65gb? Going to take a while. 

Got it from CanadaComputers, they have promo for Destiny 2 for free if you get 1080Ti, 1080 and any laptops. I sent mine invoice #... waiting for the code. I'm happy I didn't pre-order D2 yet.
Love the design and build materials of it. I understand the complain about the bottom flimsy when it is on your lap, it's a piece of magnesium / aluminium sheet hence why it is so thin. The laptop is fast, faster with my previous custom desktop with Samsung 850 EVO SSD when it comes to loading, booting.


Speaking of loudness, it is more of less a GTX 1080 Ti blower inside a sound proof chassis. It's like you have your car AC fan on at 20-30% at 2 feet away. It's quiet but it meant to use with headphones or louder external speaker when you game lol. I wouldn't game on built in tin can speakers.


Games, PUBG (Player Unknown Battleground) I died #5 spot first time playing on this laptop! Of course, I did better #2 on my previous desktop.

Going to try Battlefield 1 now. I am curious to see.


I can also give you some bench base on Final Fantasy 14: Stormblood. Max setting, fullscreen 1080p test bench.


- 3930k 4.6Ghz + GTX 1080 Ti (Stock): ~18500 pts (CPU: 50'c, GPU: 85'c)

- 6700k 5Ghz + GTX 1070 (OC): ~16000 pts

- 7700HQ + GTX 1080 Max-Q: 13270 pts **(CPU: 85'c, GPU: 65'c)** (Intel please... it's hot in here.)

- 3930k 4.6Ghz + GTX TITAN (vanilla + oc + water): ~11000 pts (CPU: 45'c, GPU: 40'c)

Nvidia is about right on GTX 1080 Max-Q, it's 20% less than the GTX 1080 non-Ti. Against Ti probably 25-30% depends on the games.

Still faster than my GTX TITAN zombie firmware v1.3 1200Mhz clock.
CanadaComputers in Mississauga.
There is .0 and .4 not .2 one. Maybe the .2 is the overclocked version.

.0 is Matt Antiglare 60hz

.4 is the Glare 60hz
Tell us about your build. :)
A lot of people think I meant "portable" it's like bringing the MacBook Pro to school without needing to plug it in to charge. 

Well that just different perception, I am not in school and working full time for years. Different purposes, it's my desktop replacement at least I don't have to come home facing the same wall for work and play (move to different room and windows. + visit family over thousand of KMs or at workplace laptop won't look ridiculous like those bulky big ones. This is why I don't really case much of the battery but doesn't hurt to have more.

15" 1440p 120Hz IPS would be nice, but I am not sure if that exist for that spec. Basically, we are looking at PG279Q in IPS cramp down from 27" to 15" format. The resolution on readability is going to be bad, I would rather have 4k from there so it can scale properly.
https://imgur.com/a/sgSfi
I saw the controversial about it on some forums and websites. This is actually a revision 2.0 according to the information on the box and manual and the date was built at lease from week 32 of 2017. I saw it somewhere, I ran a benchmark the only thing that is hottest is the CPU. It could be thermal paste was poorly done and I usually redo the paste on every GPU or laptop I get including MacBook Pro.

Bench: GPU 65c and CPU 85c

Everything will get outclassed. GTX 1080 Ti was actually too powerful when I got it for my 1440p screen for what I play and do. ‚ÄúNo such thing is too much power!‚Äù
I know right. We need GSYNC on phone one day!
Yes, after open box I skate on it across my driveway. ;)

/jk

It‚Äôs industrial design surface. Laptop chassis is made of magnesium/aluminum something along the line. I believe the only part that is plastic is the keyboard facet keys.
wow...
Yup
True, but I sold my GTX 1080 Ti custom computer. I need something portable. 

Of course I can get multi 1080 ti with that money, but anyways I didn‚Äôt pay full price. I got some discount here and there. ;) wink wink
I‚Äôm picturing mountain of fallen leaves and drive through it...
Most local stores has the only model but not in stock, Canada computer has it in stock. Check the stock page.
Very compact but the spacing is just right compare to traditional keyboard. The keyboard I dislike is the Logitech G910 and some Alienware laptop has those shortcut side keys. Those are very annoying that my pinky kept on hitting them.
Keyboard feels natural thanks for the width but the height is a bit squished down to get used to it. It comes with the wristpad, just for long term comfort if you plan to use it all day.

Since I am so used to Cherry MX keyboard. Going back to rubber dome does feel indeed weird. I wish those keys on GX501 when you press at the edge of the key, it become uneven pressure. I would prefer MacBook Pro keyboard tactile feels to be honest.

The trackpad is narrow but it's a multi-touch glass trackpad. Or multi-gestures are fantastic to control the volume, back and fore track and pause/play since the keyboard doesn't have a media key controls.
Ok, I am not clear why the website no mention of IPS.

The screen is definitely IPS display running at 120hz GSYNC sRBG 100%. 

I can tell since I used to have PG278Q 144Hz ROG TN + IPS 27" display with 1080Ti. Different is night and day.
This is the NA model (Canada). Right out local store in Toronto:

- BIOS v300 (out of the box) - disable manual fan control and some thermal optimization...
- Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7 7700HQ Processor
- Windows 10 Pro
- 16 GB DDR4 2400MHz SDRAM
- 15.6" (16:9) LED backlit FHD (1920x1080) 120Hz Anti-Glare Panel with 100% sRGB IPS with G-Sync
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 with Max-Q Design , with 8GB GDDR5 VRAM
- 512GB PCIE Gen3X4 SSD
- 4 x USB 3.0 port(s) Type A
- 1 x HDMI, Support HDMI 2.0 
- 1 x Type C USB3.1 (GEN2) Thunderbolt
- 1 x Microphone-in/Headphone-out jack 

The only thing I don't understand why this laptop needs a 230w power brick... that brick is huge... bigger than Dell bricks lol.

edit. I think I know why, it's has the ROG overclocking.
I don't think I am going to sleep tonight. 
$4000 CAD mousepad is awesome.
Same but how odd when one of the unboxing video shows it come with a mouse. I‚Äôm thinking depends on the model that was sold to the country.

I am, I have JVC M720BT model has both world CarPlay and Android Auto. 
For the H&K speakers, I know they are wonderful brand but to be honest they aren‚Äôt much different from the stock. Major improvement if you upgrade your infotainment unit and add amp but again the 2018 model is a new story. I wouldn‚Äôt bother replacing the stock infotainment since it has CarPlay and Android auto built in. Maybe add an amp with kicker  
I have them and they are super useful. Especially when you camp under the rain or resting in your car with engine off. If I don‚Äôt crack my windows open with engine off either in the summer gets hot or fog up. No ventilation if you turn off your engine, I know you can run on ACC but battery will drain out.
Or are you all thinking I got a cat stuck under the hood?
$500 USD? Jeez, rather stick with proper CarPlay + Android Auto unit future proof. For that price can swap install on other cars but I know most car will have built in anyways. 
Kinda of useless too on my XV... just gig gadget... I would know my tires slip at the wheel. 

Fun thing you can see where you steered your wheel at. 

Display kind of making feel like I‚Äôm driving a car in TRON.


Looks like KIA dealership is among them?
Im pretty sure it was tow with dolly, that would be the quickest way.
They come from the carrier ship at the dock so it does come in large batch along with other new owners across the country. I am not sure where in US but in Canada, I know Subaru unload from Vancouver dock. However  I don‚Äôt know what transport they use for inland. Train, airplane? I doubt they use the truck for long distance inland.

Is your keyless push start or traditional key? Traditional key just use the old way turn open your door and turn on your car as usual. You just loose the remote unlock and lock.  Nothing more.

The transponder chip has no battery. They work just like our credit card chip NFC. Near Field Communication

As a new driver, I wouldn‚Äôt be worrying about those under power. As daily driver myself (I‚Äôm in my 30s) the car acceleration is fine and it‚Äôs not a race car like WRX. 

It is still quicker than Honda Civic I used to drive. AWD give better acceleration across the board in general vs FWD on the same power. Even better in rough weather. You don‚Äôt have a dead wheels to drag in a FWD car. 

In winter time, AWD is the quickest car around the block. Not fastest but quick; both are different thing. If you want fast, you need to be a fast driver yourself not the car. üòÖ

As you described, Crosstrek would be a perfect car because it is shorter than my old Honda Civic believe it or not; so parking made easy but has lot more room than Mazda CX-3 and Honda HRV. Mazda and Honda are part-time AWD after adding $2000 option for it. 

Mazda does not have roof : side rail, I think Honda ones don‚Äôt either. Application and accessories are limited. This is why I love Subaru, can install any kind of rack and mods for camping or off roading.

You can decide manual or auto. Both can have control on gears for up and down hill. Auto is sequential automatic, basically you have shift paddler to control just like manual gearbox except it‚Äôs CVT with 6 speed. It is not gimmicks, it is functional and I use it in urban and rural. Choice is yours.
Can you jack it up and retight those wheel nuts 96 ft lbs? If doesn‚Äôt work rotate tires. It could be defective tires. 

This happened on a WRX STI 2018 owner brand new.
Quebec has the no fault as well basically everyone pay up attentional cost on acquiring your car license plate to cover the no fault. So the cost for the insurance is not heavy as Ontario. Quebec I would pay $900-1200 yearly where in Ontario is $2000+

Oh if you are retired in Quebec with clean record, your car insurance is about $300-400 yearly.
Nice sky line shot, mate! That‚Äôs an odd looking tree.

30 times in 20 second? LOL you got to have fast hands to do a click in split second.
Best to have a separated set on steel rims and ignore the sensors. First save time, avoid damaging the tire wall and rim every time they  swap remount, your summer all season and winter last much longer. Maybe long until you sell your car after 10 years+ 

My old civic after 15 years still on the original OEM Tire‚Äôs because in the winter I have another set.
 Need to do mine as well. The plastic on the rail has some stains.

Tip 1: Sit-up.

Tip 2: Put in reverse.

Tip 3: Put hand behind passenger headrest.

Tip 4: Check side mirrors from left to right.

Tip 5: Check rear cam make sure there no short people behind.

Tip 6: Lean and turn your head to look behind as you reverse.

Tip 7: As you approach near car or obstacle, check your rear cam yellow green lines for he distance.

Tip 8: Don‚Äôt use 100% rear cam as you backup. In parking lot some idiot will be blasting by 30-40kph.

I know how you feel, that is one reason I went with Spotify but I spend more time in my car on daily driving. Spotify in CarPlay was crash fest and not sure why. I did refreshed my phone and it is still happening. 
Spotify never fix or improve the CarPlay functionality and forever bug crash CarPlay every first time connect to CarPlay. I had no issues with AM with CarPlay. Spotify most of the time won‚Äôt play a song even hitting play and it just freeze there. This bug has been complaining for years. You won‚Äôt hear much on everyday because majority of the driver still don‚Äôt have CarPlay yet.
$530 for 2 years?!? I think that is rip off. 2 years almost 4 oil changes. That is less than $200. There are not much maint in 2 years car to be honest.

Mine is 2 years, so far just oil change and self rotate tires... 
I don‚Äôt have HK, you can always ask for test drive at dealership. Sounds system, audio headphones and etc are really personal choice no matter what product.
What is the secret sauce in Subaru... not the first time Crosstrek keep beating other brands in the segment.

Also there is an old ads German wish Subaru is made by German.
Where can you buy those to reapply?
It looks like software issue, zoom in photo, bunch of vertical lines like an old CRT screen.
Actually I‚Äôm on the same boat since you mentioned it. I am not sure if it is by city.

CBC Marketplace already crack down on these tow truckers with the police. By law 100 meters from accident and you cannot just hook up someone victim car without consent and request. 

Tow trucker put fear on you to get your car tow. Don‚Äôt fall for that! You will get charged $600-800 to get your vehicle released by some shady depot.

Call your insurance and let them get you a proper tow trucker.
Looks really good, no need to spend $300 on gimbal?
Apple Music cannot play or download. Stuck for trying to play a song. Wtf is going on?!?!
You mean the stang owners (others)? :)
XV Top is hiding...
How do you take away its virginity once you got it?
Depends on the games you are pursuing. If you keep playing the same game like most MMO for years. Then you don‚Äôt really need to keep replacing it.
Yuck
Interesting read but I am not sure about Apple lightning cables. Mine is an aftermarket infotainment system and it has an extension wire up to my center console then additional 4 feet lightning cable. I think total is up 10feet in length. 
DI engine requires a bit more maintenance than non-DI. You will have the clean the valves with sea foam etc at certain mileage. Carbon build up is more prone to DI engines.
Your doge approves.
My family is all into Subaru. Something special about subies... what substance they put into those cars? 
Nice truck.

Is the kangaroo okay?
I upgraded from the stock iPhone 5w to 12w since I bought a Smart Battery Case. The charge rate is night and day compare to the mini 5w.
I‚Äôll be honest when my internet is back I‚Äôm going to wipe and restore. iPhone 7 here been running. Hot random time and I have a Smart Battery Case.

One thing I get crash is app random freeze up and I cannot do anything except exit home and force close it.

This also end up crashing my CarPlay.
Thanks, I can never view Peebee the same again.
Omg I would spend and camp there.
OPTIPLEX GX620
I have a Pentium D sitting here. Dell all in one.
Where I live apartment don‚Äôt even have those bin. Just garbage or recycle.
I think I should do that too. I was running iOS 11 beta before GM release.
Crashed on me when I am trying to download all the playlists. Running on Wireless to my router, 60/10 Mbps perfect connection.
Same problem here in Ontario vs Quebec plan. Lucky to have family address in QC 7gb for $54 CAD but in ON is over $100.
Was able to keep all except mic and no volume change depends on speed. I think it needs a special module for that. 

I don‚Äôt mind the extra mic built in noise cancel. Most aftermarket won‚Äôt work with the stock mic.
Turn this into baja, ;)
Man I was the bystander there, I would chase after them badly. 

Is the parking lot well lit? Best to park under a spotlight.
You will have to file the plastic of in the inner plug before plugging them. They are tight fit and can warp the plug in odd ways. 
That‚Äôs where I got mine too for crystal pearl 
I want to barf...
Same problem, a lot of single releases and small artists aren‚Äôt on Apple Music. You will fine a few of them and they are major release on YouTube, SoundCloud, Spotify before hitting Apple Music and Google Music market.

Find them on YouTube by the channel:

- xKito Music
- MrOtterMusic
- Spinnin‚Äô Records

Love it, animation sync well with my music. ;)
I‚Äôve been going back and fore both Spotify has better unpopular songs selection than Apple Music can give me all the published released songs and very META when it comes to music.

Personal choice, most of my artists are unheard and only known from YouTube artist. 

Spotify has it all but major problem, Spotify is buggy on CarPlay. 

Apple Music iTunes is bigger when you click the like button with the heart; sometime it doesn‚Äôt register and only show up half heart.
I wish I have bought Shield instead of Apple TV 4. It makes my life easier without having to run my pc rig 24/7.
Finally a side by side, I never realize how small those lights were from the first gen. 

Hey it‚Äôs me your friend!
Loud in your carbin but not outside. Bystander won‚Äôt notice much unless you have a muffler delete... 

I do notice CVT whine or droning . But that is normal. You can always invest couple of hundred on sound proofing your car. Aftermarket soundproofing > factory luxury car sound proof.
I cannot contain my laugh.
I was looking for it as well but so pricey end up pulling my center console it and wrap it with 5D , that silver trim under sunny day is blinding.
Cat‚Äôs favourite spot.
I would get smaller wheel fit just right to brake calliper. Prevent snow and ice getting stuck inner your rim. Cheaper, you don‚Äôt want expensive for winter salt. Narrower tires cut snow easier.

I mean I‚Äôm Canadian here. I‚Äôm just yapping my gum.
Yup.

People said noisy because Impreza doesn‚Äôt come with roof rail. So mounting the tower right in the pillars transfer the vibration to the hollow metal.

I got fairing 40in 
Yo
I thought best job in the world is the coast guard for coral reef in Australia? 
You have AC on? 
Isn‚Äôt that the same effect if I roll my blanket hotdog mode on my bed?

At that age you should not be driving. Even after 65, let alone 76... WTF. Bus company should be held accountable for this endanger many lives.
I never thought Monday would be this interesting.
That is the steering lock anti theft. You need to steer where it steer to harder then turn the key.

If you don‚Äôt want this to happen accidentally, don‚Äôt use the steering wheel as leverage to get in and out of your car.
I thought it was a diaper. /joke
I am sorry, complaints about what exactly? I‚Äôve been out of this Reddit Logitech for a while. Been owning Logitech products for the last 20 years.

There are quality problems but those are OSROM switch problems mostly I encounter. Not sure if I got the name right, sorry. But those switch is wide problem across any manufacturer uses them.

Also you must aware there is a surge of customer try to use other customer serial to request warranty lately. I tried to put one Logitech product on Kijiji then all I get spammed asking for the serial then I soon realize they try use my serial to get warranty. The business customer support became suspicious on every email or phone call for service.
Used it on Mac but don‚Äôt have a Mac or iPad now 
Affinity Photo by Serif Labs
Really wish that is available in Canada 
I when from iPhone 4 to 7.
Your phone quickest charge is at 2.1A anything more wont give you quicker time. iPad are at 2.4A.
You don‚Äôt need a 29w. I got the 12w $12 used. As long it output 2.1A or 2.4A. It‚Äôs all about the amperage output to your phone.
/r/subaru
If if send you side shot mine, can you pixelate mine?
Spoiler is 50/50 look and functional. It reduce crosswind on highway. Means almost no swaying in high windy day and near trucks.

Mine came without spoiler drove the highway for 6 months. I get push to the left every morning to work on windy day. Then added the spoiler, 6 months driving. I don‚Äôt remember I need to constant steer against the crosswind. Ever since I got the spoiler. I kept my steering light touch and straight. So it did help cut down the crosswind on a hatch car.

Not meant for downforce to be honest. Crosstrek has a lot of drag without the spoiler. It explains why the hybrid has an extended spoiler.
Yes it will fit lol. I fitted the entire IKEA KLIPPAN into my XV.




... hatch half opened.
I‚Äôm waiting D2 on pc :( 
I know right? Need some more digits in front of the zero. 
Looks like Ontario plates? Driveway meet anyone?
Google will try to find anything against Apple. :) irony
Some advertiser doesn‚Äôt know other way to advertise. Some company rely on word of mouths that gain a lot more trust. Subaru, Apple, etc they do announcements ads but don‚Äôt spam like freaking GM cars ads posting price and get it today crap.
When you get boxed in for 2-3km beside a truck and the car not moving any forward.
Buy chalk that use at school for the board. Draw lines around the entry points. It will mess up their pathing.
Just curious are there any shops accept trade in good condition winter tires for something else?
Prolightz has them. Just cut it on your own. Nothing that hard as cutting construction paper in school.
I think your car would prefer on your dashboard just as always sit in front of your computer screen.
Mine Gorilla Mudflaps same as RB, they are stiff and ran it for 2 years with 1 winter. Ran over some rock or went over some divider on the side. So back into the curb that would likely tear it down. Nope still intact. 

Only I hope it doesn‚Äôt tear my entire rear bumper down. Otherwise my car would feel like someone just yank my pants down in the public. 
LOL
Beyond those speed is merely acceptable anyhow. I would agree if I am on fast lane going 120. Would stick but if the right lanes are clear. Why not stick to middle.

I‚Äôm talking about people driving 80-90km on fast lane without rush hour traffic.
I really don‚Äôt want Canada to drive like in Russia, or other world crisscross driving all over the places. Seen too much liveleak videos or accident videos.
Hogging the passing fast lane on the left while the other two right lanes jams with 18 wheelers. 

End up boxed in, flash and honk at them to move ahead and out of the way otherwise I will miss my exit. This on 401 going west... every dam morning. I end up running middle lane passing by cars on left most lane like wtf. 
I drove behind so many distracted drivers and slowing down the dam traffic swerving side to side on the straight lane. Like wtf... honked the f... at them and flash them like they had no idea what is going on. Holy shit... drove by it. Driver‚Äôs head down looking at the phone. This happens like 10 times in one week.

Almost time for me to invest into some Hella horns. Or train horns :/
I thought the dot means Mario life left each time I drop my phone.

Entire notch at the top basically. Shrunken Mini Kinect same as the Xbox Kinect.
That looks like mine stock in Canada. lol do you have gauges on it now? So I have WRX components in my car as stock. XD
Was it 100,000 km for CVT fluid?
There is only four screws behind the grill and then you have clip you can just pinch it out from behind.
Yes your carrier sim can kill your battery. For unsupported network. A colleague fixed the problem switching carrier and no more battery drain. 
iPhone 4 (old) 

Nexus 4, Moto X Play, Samsung S5 Neo all crash madness for the last 6 years of Android.

Back to iPhone heaven working fine.

So no the meme doesn‚Äôt apply to me.
I‚Äôll be honest if I can get a yellow. I‚Äôll take it. All the cars in Toronto are silver black grey dull. Zzzz
This happen to me when I do full lock turn. This car can turn right as Mercedes.
I freaking love unheard artist and remix. I am tired of the meta music these days. 
Heat gun. Look up on YouTube wrap heat gun. Super easy.
PUBG always jump scare me because we all force volume high as F to hear footsteps but forget about shotgun next to your ears in your headphones. 

I‚Äôve gone deaf.
I wrapped mine, so I don't have to deal with plasti-wears off over time between winter (ice) and summer to remove bug and tar.. it also removes the dip. 

https://imgur.com/a/9PxuR
Is it me or all the Subaru brake pedal travel is deep compare to other cars? Nissan rental, that travel distance is about 2 inches before it bottom out. Highlander rental, about 4 inches. My Crosstrek takes a foot travel distance. Same for the Fozzy 17' XT.
If there a pink Crosstrek, I would take it. Manly color.
I do... I was thinking to get something to seal it. I don't really want it to suck all the heat from the engine and dirt if it can leak beside the filter (if you have charcoal filter delete)
How is your signal from your carrier? Could be your SIM card has been killing iPhone. There was case on this. Change your SIM card.
How would Face ID works for me in a car that won‚Äôt have CarPlay and mounted on the vent for gps. What if the phone lock itself after a while. I have to lean my entire torso just to get face id unlock it? That would cause people swerve the steering and accident. 

How would it work for drive-thru payment? I have to lean my entire torso out of the windows to tap pay with my face for Apple Pay?
Check your iPhone cable, try another one. Check your iOS update.

CarPlay and Android Auto works like a secondary monitor projection. There are no CarPlay app inside the Subaru head unit. 
It looks cozy, you don't mind if I can just snug there in your trunk?
If you plan to buy stock OEM swap. Serious you rather spend $600 on aftermarket one with CarPlay and Android Auto. With all radio features. Some unit requires a separated module for SirusXM cost about $60
It‚Äôs not copying, stop this theory. Would all car company go electric because they copy each other? This is about future technology, we are moving on. 
Waiting till the day phone unify control my car, house lights, doors, oven, microwave, etc etc.

I mean we have it now but it‚Äôs all third party brands and some are cheaply made or crap.

Your phone is your supercomputer wherever you go. The power in your very own hand can also launch some... dammit. NOPE
YES! YES! YES!YES! 

Sorry I need to calm myself, I've been waiting for this fix for decades. I'm just freaking out now!
To answer your title. Drive through Hurricane.
OH GOD  I can‚Äôt begin to think with the pain of glue in the blood vessels.
What about I need to go to bathroom?
Awesome, I see you have the entire radio tower mounted on the rack. How is your MPG? 99L/100km?

/joke
Yakima roll bars with fairing still manage 7L/100km on highway. 

The tower cost the most but they are the most important part of the rack system. OEM is not suitable for heavy loads over 130lbs per bar? 

My Yakima is rated 150lbs. It‚Äôs really pay what you get.
I would rather drive and flee to higher elevation. 
Mine is working... the new shadow play now use multi channel recording. If you have it turned on, the mic audio is in 2nd channel. To access it you need video editing softwares or media codec player Media Classic Player able to select a diff channel
Spotify lack of innovation in coding to move away from flash base audio player under the engine. Spotify CarPlay always have issue booting up to play music. Just no sounds and I had to force close it on my phone to relaunch it. Love the algorithms but hate the comparability with Apple. 

Always need to hack around to get it working.
That‚Äôs how you start a Subaru family. :)
You‚Äôre right that is going to be the biggest threats in the history!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For a 60Hz, 1070. 1080 Ti if you have 120Hz or 144Hz monitor without G-Sync. If you have G-Sync, 1070 should be good as well. 
You can do it without going anywhere. Donuts in the dirt.
Bug splats really tough to get rid of when you cook them under the sun for very long in the hot summer. 

This is a good idea if you want to keep your clearcoat untouched.
Awesome, it came with a cat too!

Honestly, sometime I love the old dashboard style in old cars. Classy feel when you drive them.
"F"... 
Then we have Hydro to deal with unless you are using your neighbors electricity. Solar panels takes a long time to charge.
I guess this is your very first time driving a car? This is normal for all the cars.
The differences is the tow strut length. Most are compatible and I wouldn‚Äôt worry much. 

Some owner prefer to sit flat 90 degree at the front. Mine just slanted. 
Oh look the Hulk!

If you don't even go plan to go off asphalt. I'm probably looking steel plate / road sign to replace the flimsy plastic. 
Some people can‚Äôt judge the distance between their bumper and the curb. For Crosstrek is a bit under 2in the side mirror sight from your eye level. (Depends how high you sit also)

Or use your foot on dead pedal judge your wheel size.
Well I am not sure but a long pc gamer here, the time I press the mouse trigger. I have the habit to drag the mouse toward me as I am used to recoils in almost every FPS games. Muscle memory now. 
Yeah, the sound options are lacking in the setting.
Really? This is default included in Canada even the lowest trim...
Switch and button always control the relay, not the direct power to light. You don‚Äôt want to jam xxx Watts on your switch. That would melt it.
Just T-Tab slice. Crimp the tab then done. Click the link photo, desc is on the imgur site.

Have you tried another android phone?
I rather leave it as reflectors, they are designed if you parked your car in the dark, people headlight from distance can get a reflect that there is something there. Passive safety. Not all headlights are bright enough to shine a clear view if you have a car there and some headlight aimed low below the bumper.

Question is, are these would work as reflector when it is off?
Thought mine was a polar bear until now.
So much braking power...
Drive up to Jeep car meet. I like to see how they react. c:
Might as well sue the carrier for allowing SMS/MMS/Data.
Holy shit so many shits on your shit.
My father got the highest trim Foz, basically he got a WRX but rooms for family, he likes to sit high up to see traffics and storage.

Every time I come visit him, I say ‚Äúnice WRX you got there‚Äù
Omg much Breaking Bad
Also stay away from American brands... quality is sh!t. However the Pontiac Aztek was rated pretty good thanks to Japanese engine but that is one hell of a ugly car.
/r/XVcrosstrek/

Subaru resale value is sky high compare to other cars. 2017 model should have incentive now and on special due to the 2018 new global platform which is a much better overall crossover. Also, they are known for best car for winter + winter tires.
Oh gosh, I rather just look up instruction and torque them in. If you have the torque wrench, you‚Äôre good for life for anything on your car.
Being robbed but the person is still alive / uninjured by large chance, if guns are reachable by anyone; you will have both parties injured or death by a large chance.
Stay out of the street at midnight till 6am. Have a friend or family walk with or a large dog if you have one. Streets are horrendous dark with those energy saving LED in Mississauga. LED diode lights glow but doesn‚Äôt shine far enough. Perfect environment for smugglers like anywhere.

This goes for all cities lol stay out of the street at night if you can. It‚Äôs not safe as you think especially Mississauga polices are MIA...  I‚Äôm from another city in Canada, moved here and Mississauga is stupid dark at night.

Late night coming home, take a cab or ask for pickup (friends or families). 

My place has a street LED lamp right in front can‚Äôt even shine far enough to reach the yard doors. It sucks.
15 / 16 / 17... can't decide... Would this 15" clear the brakes? I know Method wheels do.

Depends your need and budget. The best bang of the buck is the Yakima Round Bars low cost and strong. Won‚Äôt bend a bit like those Areo. Because they are round... 
Your car is such a tree hugger.
Well here goes my Internet cap for the month.
yep, you missed a spot!
Nope, mine just sit pretty on the driveway.
It is terrible, I have the same year model. I swapped it out as I can but budget problem until now. KW-M730BT
Both, more functional for outdoorsie rainy days you can keep windows open for air, especially if you have pets and leave windows crack as large as the visor when you‚Äôre at mall.  Keep things flying into your cabin on highway lol. 

If you sleep in your car camping, crack window open for air without a worry about rain storm.
I have to agree! I‚Äôve experience my tires do follow the road groves / patches and slanted highway tend to drift off. 
Agree, the Crosstrek is so light it flies sometime going too fast on some uneven roads at the intersection. /almostfeltlikerallycarflyby 
The dial tone was used by the apple map voice as well, i cannot lower that volume and also it ignores my audio fade and positioning completely. It plays on all speakers all the time.
r/battlewagon is more rigged up from stock for rough roads. More for r/XVcrosstrek

holy shit that isn't cheap you got there as a gift... wow that is $400 CAD for that cooler!
LOL, just a cooler bag instead carry a heavy plastic cooler or cheap lunch bag.
Highly you should get dashcam to fight it. Aim the view up a bit. Depends on your dash memory size. Should download weekly to your computer in case something like this happen. I‚Äôm sure the ticket in the mail will take weeks or months.
You have android auto as well on 2018 both world.

iPhone uses CarPlay 

Android phone use Android Auto

Built in navigation if you plan to go off the grid.
Check wires and hoses... they chew on them. Hope the parts aren‚Äôt costly.
CarPlay uses data from your phone for the map but it consume if you go to place that you haven‚Äôt been much.

Built in navigation works better if you are off the grid completely.

In city I stick to Apple Map or Google Map
I have not seen one in person, is the orange is now Pearl mix? Any Pearl paint will show shade differences on different materials.

It can be removed but you are going to leave out all those gaps bolt location., might need to get Impreza liner parts or the black strip.
I had one on my trunk, weird I know. I think someone accidentally poke the paint during the license plate installation.

I thought it was brake dusts, anyways, touch up pen, grind it out with the fiberglass end and layer by layer. Really recommend a toothpick out of wrapper to touch out. The pen tip too much paint in general.
Solution, you can install aftermarket tailgate strut adjustable. Would be the best solution.
I wonder how much smaller is the roof now.
Clay bar the glass, guarantee any delicate sticker will stick forever and jet wash proof. I had sticker peeled off by jet wash lol because I didn‚Äôt claybar the surface of the glass.
I‚Äôm curious is the skybox already at the most forward position mounting?
At the back of the seat lol
You know it‚Äôs a joke the last part.

Why The Division in DX12 still runs like piece of potato? Constant FPS freeze every 5-10 seconds.
There is pen holder too, card holder bottom of the arm cover. Also bottom of the console tray if you have one. There are storage space under your seat and also there is a secret pocket on the passenger side. There is also tool slots in the spare tire area. Also there is a space to store secret key in the bumper buttplug.

Never been through a coin-wash, can you just skip other feature just use water jet and etc. even paying the same amount? Like I don't really want to use the bristle brush on my paint...

TekSavvy was great until it was expanding too fast. They are eating more than can handle for their customer services.

After 10 years with TSI, I switched to Start Communications. Uptime is better and no DNS issue like TSI always had from time to time.

DNS is Dynamic Name Server, pretty much like a directory phone book when you look up an address on your browser. So, put it better analogy, you need to go somewhere and the Google Map or Apple Map froze on you; you stall.

Same for the Teksavvy DNS sometime goes down, your Internet stall but not disconnected. Just nothing loads; then you wait...

All my steering, USB + AUX under the armrest works with just the adapter made for subaru 
Should go for harnesses, since you can return to stock easily.
I have the similar or same issue, JVC M730BT. The map volume is the only volume I cannot lower. It is loud and it ignore the audio positioning if I set it by the JVC sound setting. Other audio follows the sound setting.

Map always play on all speaker no matter which cross fade or position audio I set to.
This COULD be a good thing finally! With guidelines, allow third party to standardize for CarPlay experiences. Otherwise there is not point on creating guidelines / training for designer. 
I gave up on mine entirely. Just aftermarket swapped it. I am much a happier guy now.

https://imgur.com/a/UrLks

JVC KW-M730BT

I had one issue with the map guidance being too loud. I just drove to JVCKenwood headquarter last week in Toronto and show the guy who work there the issue. Pretty sure this can be fixed by a firmware update.
He's trying to protect the rear rims from gravel.
Thanks Subaru.

Hello Ontarian! Good job I did the same about a few months ago, now I got bird dropping on mine and it was pain in the arse to wipe it off. My car is waxed but dam stupid birds went on diarrhea on my car.
Spotify is way better than Apple Music, song selection are more accurate to my taste and the feature integrate between my Apple TV, Windows 10 and my CarPlay is like seamless. My iPhone controls where I want it to play.
About $650-700 USD with the whole kit. If you self install. Plug and play.
I rather have mud on my car than bird shit. I have bird shit on the rear and front. Gosh dam birds.

Sorry my morning rant going to work.
All functional, the screen dim if you turn on headlights etc
For that price, I went for JVC M730BT (CarPlay + Android Auto) + Best Audio Output Unit on the market.

Been using A118C, it doesn't have those fancy on going recording like BlackVu which is crazy expensive.
Not CarPlay, basically its own android phone embed. Will have to tether to your phone for data
You trust dealership mouth? Should read your manual, it said here if there is a break in. All the subaru manual written.

Always always always follow manufacturer instruction. Not dealership, they rather have you break your car to get $$$ repair.
Keep pouring gas into fire...

Look at the front bumper, 2016-2017 has the hockey stick foglight.
Platform is the same, I agree but I can't speak for 2018 model Crosstrek vs 2017 Impreza.

The last gen, Crosstrek has 1500pound tow capacity, bigger radiator, bigger disk brake, lifted, etc etc.
lol no, that's 2015 or less.

This is why I never really went to any **small** afterwork meets, I am in Toronto GTA area. 10min from Subaru Headquarter of Canada. For Canada Hypermeet is different, we are diverts here and I've seen a varieties of model in the grand meet.

They asked why you have a scoop? Sounds like they don't know the history of Subaru after owning one. Sounds like new kids never seen a cassette player. I feel like people these days are for show but nothing under the head. Much same for ricer mods, non-functional mods like glue a scoop, fake side vent and fart can.
The new orange... is making me thirsty.
I think I need to contact JVC, if other brands work as intended.
I did they don't do anything with the HUD.

There are different type of spoiler lol don't judge spoiler equal downforce and racing.

XV spoilers are not downforce. Hatchback car has a know issue without spoiler behind it. A drag vacuum behind because of the drop off from the pressure.

The spoiler on Crosstrek helps 2 things these are spoiler to reduce drag at higher speed 100km+ hence reduce the vacuum behind the hatch. Second it breaks the crosswind.

Crosswind will push your car off the track line on highway or for example passing by a 18 wheels trailer.

Mine did not come with spoiler and in GTA Toronto on highway is very windy plus tons of trucks. My XV always steer or sway off the track from the crosswind and it was annoying. The sway was from behind the rear.

I had the spoiler installed for 6 months now. As far I can tell you, I barely need to deal with crosswind anymore thanks to the spoiler that break away the winds. It did improve my car handling again high windy situation.
Very nice, enjoy. Only 4 miles on it... that is fresh shiny new car smell.
Should restore the paint a bit and fix the dents. That would be a classic nice looking subie.
What news?
2 years... I don't have that... I have Gorilla mudflap protect the doors.
Same problem, I am upgrading to aftermarket this week. CarPlay / Android Auto
Lifestyle and simplicity. 
Omg you guys lol made my day - awesome derail 
CVT is fine you have shift pad if you want some sequential manual. I have only driven a Hyundai manual. Can't speak for STI
Retrofit time if you have the budget. Maybe be the first 2018 XV retrofit?
Can't see any XV, is that lady floating above the beautiful lake?
Because lack of gov support for the company who is going to hire interns. It cost time and money to train newbies. Without half salary support by gov the company aren't willing to spend 100% on the intern. 

I had to work 2-3 years after my 3 months of unpaid internships back in Montreal 2009 from college. Then after I continue on in University and still manage to work full time 40hrs + 3 classes per semester. After uni I would still be working since I have plenty of experiences already.

Don't take this as the best way, there are many ways. My sister did. It work and jump straight to university then switch program and university twice. No work experiences but she was lucky to manage to get hired by friend recommendation .
I don't have this problem. 
I'll take that skyjack any days.
Well no wonder why all these road signs are missing lately. :)
Fuck... would have shat myself.
Hot day 30c + with AC ... acceleration is completely Plummer down lol feels like I am driving a 100hp car. My throttle was at 75% according to the HUD.

Wish XV is at least 200hp

By the way have you try to accelerate with AC then turn it off? Feel the boost haha
eGPU, external GPU. Game is also CPU intensive because of the simulation.
Look at Toronto and mississauga road system on google map 
I would go with AEM dry filter vs oil base one. Oil can cover up the oxygen sensor over time that you might need to buy some MAF cleaner to clean it.
Lightbar 5D $60 CAD + custom lightbar mount by me $30. Lol

3000km with it on my car now. No issues.
Awesome username! 
Interesting, might also get yourself an OBD-II reader on Amazon in the future.
Dam... I wish I have time off or super long vacations. Working all my life sadly. Can't go far by car.
LOL I know right, the more I scroll down... I see repeat phrases.

There is a Crosstrek Competition Platform a few weeks ago in Toronto Hypermeet 2017 for CRC: https://icdn-9.motor1.com/images/mgl/kZxpY/s3/tsc-hypermeeting-2017.jpg

Months ago I bought off an IKEA KLIPPAN love seat couch from a lady and I was able to fit into my Crosstrek but I had to hook my hatch down. It was half opened only.
Easy swap but I don't recommend since it creates glare and it doesn't shoot far as halogen it just glow bright the surrounding.

I had them before I did a complete retrofit which is much better.
If you are coming from luxury cars, you will find it more noisier.

Are you guys all testing straight computer LAN port to modem? Speed drop can result of a crap router CPU not enough to process the data.
0 to 3mph rocket power clip part what he said, that is accurate. During traffic jam I had to rest my foot on my throttle to prevent a sudden drop rpm when I am going really slow.
Computers are not car these days. They have self protection from overheat if you don't dust your computer regularly from laziness. Computers can last for ages until you feel it is too slow to run the latest application. 
Accidentally update one app, done for the month. 100 MB is a joke

Nice plate lol, Ontario vanity plate cost an arm... $310 CAD for a set.
'15 did not have oil consumption issue, I heard they did remedies the issue with the piston rings.
Waiting for my OEM Geolandar to wears out first. lol

I am curious how good are these in Snow/Ice for these Geolandar ATS
$20 touch up pen from dealership. That pen comes with 3 steps. Check your car safety/capacity plate, it should have the color code. If not, it would be on the passenger side one. ie. Crystal Pearl White is K1X.
Safety practice even wears from weigh shift (braking, torque split). Front will tend to wear faster than rear.
Really depends by how cold it is (if below 20'F, it is recommended for cold tires). AWD won't help braking job and its the cold tire will help the frictions on the cold slick surface roads. If you slam the brake, it's the same effect for all the cars today with ABS.


I've seen plenty of SUV AWD rear ended other other cars, because they have summer tires and they think they are invisible with AWD. 


Think of how hockey puck on ice.

~fellow Canadian driver.
Oil change interval, check your last oil change receipt from her. Every 6 months or 10,000 km

For Canada, dealership program the middle HUD as reminder. Of course you can set it yourself as well.

Tires rotation spring and fall.

If you care about paint:
Hose your car to get mud off, hand wash microfibre with 2 buckets technic, rinse your car. Clay bar your car and check for paint chip if need to touch up to prevent rust. Apply wax, let it dry up under the shade for 10min. By hand Microfibre wipe the excessive wax and polish it. Done. Do it once a year, other time just rinse and wash.
Been 20 years on internet, you seriously haven't switch? 20 years experiences I will tell you this now.

There are many new ISP, similar level as EBOX today. Go on DSLREPORTS (google it)
Rofl I love redditors commentary 
That tiny engine is more powerful than my Crosstrek.  /s
It's okai, you can admit your car likes to sniff those stuff.

Honda Civic SE 2001 to Crosstrek'15 here. Because Subaru retain similar feel to hydraulic steering even it is electronic today. I test drive many other crossover/SUV none come close to hydraulic classic responsive and feel of the car. I'm old school c:
I heard iOS 11 will have it soon by default for long exposure shot?
Took it from Toronto Hypermeet 2017?
Yeah, could be very subjective. I have a 144Hz at home pretty can tell a different from 60Hz.
The 12.9 (2016) vs 12.9 (2017)
Engine is 80% new materials on the 2018. I saw a lot of review they compare to old model. The responsively is slightly better due to new 7 speed in CVT and new programming. I assume the low ratio is a shorter jump and quick high RPM plus new engine direct injection with extra 4HP over the old one. The old one is not direct injection.
The same reason and opinion as you, the current model 2013-2017 on highest trim doesn't have a true projector HID even they said it is HID. It's just a tar brighter but nothing compare to my retrofit after a few month of driving it. https://imgur.com/a/1rvys

Ignore the center round beam of spot light that is coming from the lightbar but for retrofit that is a sharp and wide light on the ground. Retrofit is custom and obviously would void your warranty on your headlights. I am not worry since all the original sockets are just unplug and straight setup power to the new sockets. So I can always get the original housing back to stock.

There is one aftermarket full swap headlight but I never seen them in person.

For 2018, new on the market if I were you I would probably just opt for the lowest trim with projector. It is known that Subaru put very low lumen bulbs in their production cars. If it is the case, just swap the bulbs.
Time to reapply thermal paste.
That is out of factory customization. Not mods.
Came factory like this on every subaru not the dealer drilled them. I had those hole plugged with the same paint. Bumperplug 
I am on the verge to delete it if it was not for some app auth to login. Regret I should never tie app login to Facebook.
CX-3 is too cramped and no roof rail!
This is why don't recommend the OEM crossbars. I went with aftermarket Yakima Round Bars . They are study and strong as hell. Basically a round steel bars .
You got some ketchup on your elbow.
Actually it did not, some DDOS going on in California right now. I just checked with DSLReports.com
It was one of the email causing some problem with the interface. I deleted it. It fixed it.
Man... how do hold this phone anymore with hand one. Got to be hard not tab anything at the bottom
Ever since I had GSYNC I forgot about stuttering gameplay. I went back on non GSYNC ... I can't stand the stutter anymore.
I had a lot of trouble mounting device on this car because all the controls are in the way. Haha and I did not like the idea of having suck a mount suction on the windshield and leave a dirty ring mark.
2015 here, I haven't broke 29k yet
@bioware please look up on YouTube NoClip documentary for FFXIV, a game major failure to major success. There are no game developer done better than the producer of FFXIV. 
The 3TB Seagate one? Mine is dead, it's a known lemon HDD. I got quoted long ago in another province for $1000. ouch.
Did they fix the issue with Andromeda that it starts recording at 1080p instead of the 1440p / 4k? Because how Frostbite engine boot up 1080p before scaling up to native resolution. During the boot up it made GFE think the game will run at 1080p.

So whatever I save the recording, I was disappointed it was stuck at 1080p. I had to turn off and on the Shadowplay to re-enable the 1440p res +
The hinge where you see the tube, you can use some string or wire to hook that cable through it. You will have to pop the quarter panel. Very easy.
I always thought that was a sandstorm out of nowhere.
For electric turbo...

/saltonwounds
Those strap... you when see they loosen them up the car suspension raise up.

Imagine how much tension they put into that strap and... poor paints on the A pillar and the front bumper.
We also have to understand to the state of the game the old contents are falling way behind that can actually it is very hard to keep people going back to old contents. Especially the ARR. No one wants to do that in 5.0 or 6.0... lol
Don't we want all or more people to run you dungeons especially DPS is now having 60 min queue. Bringing more people into the game potentially increase tank and healer as well. More 24/7 people around to run the game.
It was probably the farmer and gold seller bots. I blame them for flooding server.
Nice but I still love my 2015 buggy
Have you look at the one from WellVisors?
Canada is going to change that. Thanks CRTC
After E3 2017 lots of folks are getting ready for those new games.
1440p
My 3930k at 4.7ghz is already bottlenecking my 1080Ti.
Don't forget count non-steam users.
It's 2017 people still discovering 60hz these days. Let alone anything higher.
144hz and 165hz. Stop laughing at us!
Massive user interface reset ... need to redo all for hours
None.. but I should

It's a different TOP, Sunny Orange I think. Actually a brighter orange.

I do have some rust tiny spot at the rear trunk and that explain why my Crystal White Pearl car is no longer white... beige now lol
I read that but I mean tech said no water damage by the indicator so I assume water did not seep in much.
I wonder what caused the home button to break then.
One of the main reason I went back to iPhone from 5 years of android is that iPhone now has the best receptions amongst other android phone aside from the iPhone 4 antennagate back in the days.
Someone revamp that trailer with actual gamer voice, please. Occasionally multiple version for jokes.

There are some services out there to bump those dents back out. "dent repair"
Full speed + boost = our reaction: wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwhwhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 
You can also take advantage of Nvidia Ansel
Either forums or Reddit. Most people post when they have complaints on social media. Reddit seems like the best place to gather data and votes on the issue. Also the fact of you search the problem on google, Reddit is likely come up on the first page of Google result. Same when you made a new post on Reddit and search your own post on google. The result is instant.
Plastisol did not work even 8 coats over 1.5 year winter salt and summer rock and bugs. Those dip melt as soon I use bug and tar remover lol acts like goo gone. Well I had to get those bugs off they do stick like glues. 

I went for wrap + heatgun. Much better.
Very easy to catch scammers, they ask for your full name and etc. Means they don't have that information and how they are giving you this letter? Think about it. Oh @gmail.com lol red flag.
Card quality and chip bin is different in every card out of factory. Same brand, same model all will have different overclock wall. You can't copy paste from someone setting. Person A can clock at 2100mhz doesn't you can too. Why? 

The person has different system you have to consider too and different PSU how voltages are handled . Motherboard as well a lot of things can factor in to render the card unstable. 

I had once swap a PSU because I could not get over certain overclock. Once I swap to a gold plus , my oc sky rocket. Also your Windows how it handle errors factor in. Back in the days Windows will just bluescreen out. Today it's just the game crash, things got easy now without tearing down your entire system when crashed.

It's not too late, Andromeda felt short (yes, I completed the game). Hopefully by the next sequel, they give themselves a more realistic goal, expectation and time. Do not overshoot and that is what screw up with everything.

Trying to catch and compete other games while still in pre-production. Like trying to keep ahead of Robert Space Industries, No Man Sky etc. That is what end up throwing all ideas in all direction and at the end they figure that won't work in the engine what not. Too many bug, drop the idea and wasted so much time.

One major cost, relearn and changes on new engine that did not support RPG mechanic; it creates incompetency across all team. It's normal, new engine and you don't know what it is capable of and the limitation. You only find the limitation at the end. So then, regret and frustrated.
