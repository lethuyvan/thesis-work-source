Hey thanks for saying so
I just deleted it I dont wanna risk messing up another persons experience. Wasn't even close to a good joke either tbh. I should seriously know better I posted a single comment about the axe in the god of war discussion thread on day one and the first reply was a comment spoiling the ending. 

Good luck with your finals for sure btw!!
Fuck fuck fuck I'm sorry. I can't take back you reading my comment and now I feel bad I'm deleting tho. I know that doesn't help you but at least know that I consider myself a bigger piece of human trash now than I ever have before. Still see the movie tho it's amazing and what I said is only a 1 minute piece of it. 
Everyone needs a union tbh
Man now I'm just sitting in this lobby thinking about an Avengers game developed by Sony Santa Monica. 
    `SPOILERS BELOW`

just based on the previous trilogy and how the pacing of this one was set up I'm thinking it will be Thor in the start and end of 2(that final scene when you go home oh man I want that fight RN)and then Odin and the rest of the gods in 3. Compete specualtion on my part tho
Vanaheim and Svartonsheep seem like great places to add a DLC if they wish. Asgard def won't be seen till a sequel and that's fine

Westworld is also def worth your time. They eat all the fucking rich up in that show and it's carthatic af. The hosts are the best form of Posadism I've ever seen. 

Oh heres you're @ btw don't tell me what to do with my time
Yeah I gotta agree. The trump stuff really pulled me out of the  narrative and tying the Trump election to whiterose surely wasn't in his plan back in season 1 or 2 and it showed. 

If Esmail falls on the political spectrum where I think he does season 4 may just be r/The_Mueller in TV show form and that would suck ass tbh bc season 1&2 were greaf and some of the best anti capitalist tv for normies(ugh) that I've ever seen.

Very sad that I can imagine this headline so vividly and easily. 
Kids do get covered ether through their parents employee insurance or through the state(Medicaid)if their parents don't have coverage. It's def something good but it could be so much better.  Thankfully at least it seems our big issue in the upcoming elections is getting medicare or an equivalent single payer system in place for our citizens. Being the richest country in the history of everything and having a system where people can't afford to get their teeth pulled is the height or bullshit. 

I agree that UBI would def increase quality and it is ironic. Is there a lot of talk about automation and what people are gonna do for income afterwards I'm Europe. Over here in America I haven't had one irl conversation about it and that's worrying. 
His dap game strong af. I'm so glad he looks so GD vibrant and healthy too 2020(well 2019 anyway)can't get here soon enough to.

The mandated coverage is payed for by you and your employer. So things like doctor visits, prescriptions, etc are all covered to a point after that you pay the rest. They also take money out of every paycheck to pay for it.  The last time.i had employer insurance it was a crap plan that took 18% out of every single one of my paychecks and I'd still pay out of pocket if I had to use it. Infuriating tbh. Some companies have amazing coverage to be sure and some have coverage so atrocious it's not worth using. The insurance industry gets their money either way and they're gonna e the biggest problem in our fight for universal coverage. It's a fucking mess and a half friend


Talking about UBI is a good thing people need to understand where we are heading. I'm a millennial and I thoroughly believe in my lifetime that most of the jobs available today(truck driver, burger flipper, factory worker)will be completely automated. Just America alone easily has the money to support our citizens but we'd have to make sure our corporate overlords pay their fair share of taxes and that's a big ask rn. Would def also help if we stop buying fucking jets at a billion dollars a pop but I digress

*3) pee is stored in the balls
Yes we have OSHA(workplace safety)and Labor Laws but after 100 years of being eroded by neoliberal policies they are weak af. Paid leave is on a company to company basis so some are good and some are awful. 

Im pretty sure there's no law regarding max hours you can work. Minimum wage is $7.50 an hour so even at full time you're still gonna be slap ass broke all the time. Breaks are supposedly law as well but I've had quite a few jobs where you can't take one(kitchens mostly) so youleat standing up or just wait till you clock out.

Healthcare is a whole other can of worms. We have mandated coverage yes but you need to be full time to get it. When the law passed basically all the low paying jobs won't let you get more than 20 hours a week so they don't have to offer you insurance. There is also state healthcare but it's on a state by state basis and nearly all the Republican lead states dont offer it.

I could go on and on and on suffice to say the aboslutely disgusting balance of income in our country(and the world) is.totally fucking fucked and something has to give one way or the other and SOON.

The recent teacher strikes I pray are a vanguard of this. Politcians are owned completly in this country(minus a very few good ones). We need worker solidarity and direct action to actually make a positive change in our lives and hopefully more and more people are seeing that is the way to get results.

Solidarity Forever!

Oh and [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/4/16/17243026/amazon-warehouse-jobs-worker-conditions-bathroom-breaks)is an article about Amazon workers(in the UK ffs) having to skip bathroom break while at work. A few quick searches will yield even more horror stories that I don't have the energy to read rn. Thanks for chatting about this friend
For me I think the trade-off would be worth. Better than working full time at an Amazon warehouse not being able to take a bathroom break and still needing food stamps so you don't starve 
Healthcare that won't put me in debt, real privacy laws, fast ass internet, and no president dril. I'd come over if I could for sure.

Love to live in a democracy where the only real way to keep your viewing choices private is to steal anything you watch.

For real tho after everyone got digital boxes for TV I always figured they knew but wouldn't say. No idea they just outrigh state that they keep all your info. 

No cable sub for me either but I watch on Amazon US once the show is posted there and always try to have my relatives DVRs set to record this and Mr. Robot. Jus trying to help get these numbers up. 
You get get "forgets" lol I get a bunch of "freaking s" on sci-fi.
Directv,Dish,PSvue,and I'm sure comcast and other big cable companies absolutely know what you watch live and what you watch on your DVR. So yes watching it live or recorded if you pay for TV def fucking counts for something.

Fox News staging a fucking car chase would barely register on my radar at this point for real. 
Same here friend. My first game system was a yard sale Atari. Console gaming on a TV has always just felt more "right" for me basically. It's just a lil mental tick I know but it really does make a world of difference.

You probably know this but it's Hella easy to use your Dualshock 4 with steam. So couch gaming+pc gaming if you will
Got a PS4 at launch and sold it last year after finishing Horizon and Persona to buy a school laptop. Plan was to build a decent budget rig with my measly tax return this year BUT with the spike in graphics cards, ram, etc I just couldn't swing it. Picked up a used PS4 and got steam refunds(PSN NEEDS THIS STAT) on the games I'd been hoarding to play but couldn't run yet. 

Not even disappointed really tbh GoW and Spiderman are gonna be amazing. Played through Bloodborne and The Witcher 3 again. Paying for PS plus after using steam, origin, etc for the past year is really my only complaint. 

I still have my integrated AMD laptop graphix for things like Civ V, FNV, and CK2 so I guess I'm kinda a half and half gamer now.

So from 79% to 60%. I wonder how that shakes out compared to most other fast food places. It certainly denies the standard corporate response of "we will literally go bankrupt if we pay a living wage". 

I'm gonna have to spend some time tomorrow looking at stuff like this. 

Thanks for the legwork all I can offer in return is another upvote to add to the many you've previously gotten from me. Have a regular one!
JFC did she steal the idea from season 1 of Hannibal? He did this almost same exact shit to will.

[I'm at a long red light here's an off the cuff attempt]"Folks the only way I can come on the air every day and give you the truth about killary and the deep state is this. Me and the prez need a message boi with attorney client privilege. If we didn't have that obummer would shut it down instantly". 


Ohhhh and it'd be cool if hannitys kink turned out to be waterboarding and that's why he can't do it on air 
Didn't even notice that till you posted tbh. Fucking brain worms can spread over the interwebs now welp. 
Ive been reading since I posted and there are two things im thinking.

1) sean used cohen on some payout for whatever gets his dinky up so nbd there

Or

2) sean and trump used cohen as a go-between for media talking points with the bonus of attorney client privilege. So yeah not illegal, looks hella bad in the court of pub opinion tho thats worth jacksquat currently ofc. 

At the very least imma tune in via ublock/vpn and watch hanndogg melt down tonight. 
I'm so fucking owned rn good god
Oh you better fucking believe I'm praying 
I was more worried about fucking administrators and mid level management fuckwads tbh but you are right too.

I did talk to my mom's dr last month about single payer and he said he would prefer it to dealing with insurance companies not wanting to pay for this and that and pharma reps up his ass all the time. That's just one dr sure but hopefully that's a widespread sentiment among them. 
I'm not quite dead(ikr fucking sucks) but I am full of self-loathing for the me who used to eat this shit up

I know the entrenched insurance and insurance adjacent industries will fight tooth and nail against it but fuck them for real. We have the numbers and goddamnit we can do this. 


I'm hopefully thinking the leftist to conservative aging effect is mostly dead due to how much of a fuck capitalism is now.


Like my stepdad was a dem most of his young life but when he got a house, stocks, etc he turned gop. Nowadays me and the 30 yos I know(smol sample size yes but still) are broke af, drowning in debt, don't own a thing and we are all staying steady leftist. Idk I hope I'm rigt for fucking sure tho.

Can anyone lmk what "extreme droite" translates to in English? 
Ill grey wolf for a year if this happens.
A year(I know it's been longer shut up) of this shit has made me numb to it but surely between the cash payouts Cohen made, the nightly cheerleading of Hannity, and just the general dumbassery of Trump surely mwans there's something illegal here right? Conflict of interest at the very least. I mean I know nothing matters anymore and this shit is hella funny regardless but maybe just maybe they goofed up big time this time.

Yeah I mean it came out like right after the 360 launch right. I remember I couldn't afford the console and game so I bought the strategy guide and drilled over it for a month. Good times 
HZD was so good, tore through it a week cause once I started it nothing else interested me.  The story may seem db to some people but it really pulled me in. Totally plausible that our Earth could end up just like that and tbh I would mind living there. The only thing the Witcher 3 beats it in is character building and giving you tons of interesting shit to do.

If Bloodborne didn't exist HZD would be my personal pick for best PS4 game(Spiderman may scramble these ranks) rn it's
1-Bloodborne
2-HZD
3-Witcher 3
4-Persona 5
5-tie between UC4&TLoU

I really wish I could play HZD on a pro now too. 
Oblivion is mostly fucking awesome with just a few tedious parts like the gates. Shivering Isles is still one of the best expansions Ive played to this day too.

I'm gonna get around to playing MorrowBlivion(sp?) pretty soon now that I finished my FNV run I need a deep af PC rpg to suck up my time. 
Im gonna have to check out Banshee then I see
Waiting on my friend to finish Zelda so I can borrow hers and play that and Mario. Both looks fucking amazing and haven't touched a nintedo product in so long it's almost a crime.
I gotta redl that. Got stuck on some late game mission and gave up but damn it was fun gettingthere for sure. Still playing the long war mod for 1 occasionally on my scuffed ass laptop

Man when they got to the ocean I legit thought I wasn't sober anymore. Everything had that shimmer(you know I had to do it to em) and melty wax looking feel of a good trip. Really enjoyed the movie but I'm not sure if I should watch it tripping. The lighthouse scene would surely fuck me right up.

Ok I'll be serious. Maybe burning it down woulda been a dumb idea but reconstruction was a gd mistake too. After the war we should have hung every slave owner and confederate officer and paid reperations immediately. Letting traitors go home to their land after their bitter defeat lead to nothing but sharecropping, the kkk, Jim fucking Crow, and endless "the south will rise again bs". Sure it would taken the region longer to recover but fuck you can't tell me it wouldn't have stopped or greatly slowed Church bombings, lynchings, the death of emmit till, and way too many other acts of terrosism I don't have time to list. The past ~100 years~ of backwards ass kowtowing we've had to do for my lovely neighbors is a.massive waste.

>	Removed from the literal aesthetics of the game environment, Bloodborne depicts a society built on colonial theft, using a broad spectrum of violence and complex justifications of that violence to create and maintain a system of hierarchical power.

Damn thats a good ass article. I thought the PaleBlood hunt write up was something special but it didn't make me think near as much as this one.

 Miyazaki is so damn good. His story about about his neighbors taking turns pushing each others cars up the road in the snow has always stuck with me for some reason. Cant wait to see what he does next. Same goes for Kojima and Taro Yoko. Stone cold geniuses the lot of them. 
If Spryo is done up like the recent Ratchet&Clank redo its def worth my time. Just pure fun. Never even played the originals tbh  that was my younger siblings games that took away from my Madden time. Yes I was dumb still am most likely.
