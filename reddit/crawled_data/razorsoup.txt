What chat function?
My name is pretty common and there's at least one fairly famous person that shares it. The first page of Google search results for my name is mostly stuff about Vsauce.
The order of your first comment made it seem like you were saying it's easier to get hurt on a backyard trampoline.
> I agree on the tell, I've been meaning to put in a sound or a flash of particles to indicate battle has been engaged.

Please make it visual instead of audible. The only times I have to play games on my phone require me to play with the sound turned off so games that rely too heavily on audio are difficult for me to play.
>And automated playlists / recommendations (daily mix, discover weekly, release radar)

Which is rendered basically useless if you have small children and you play music for them from your account. At least GPM allows me to switch profiles relatively easily. My kids' music poisoned my recommendations from Spotify making all of those features pointless.

>And social connectivity (collaborative playlists, facebook, user searching, friend activity, playlist finding/sharing)

And since none of my friends are on Spotify, this feature is moot for me.

I really want to like Spotify. I had premium for quite a long time but it just doesn't work very well and the devs seem uninterested in fixing the issues that do exist.
I have my phone's font size set to where most things are comfortable to read but I found the font in QK to be either too small or too thin/light.
Just checked it out and it looks pretty good. I would like more options for customization though. Things like font size and color (I found the text on the conversation list to be difficult to read on my device) and I would love the option to have each contact be a random color. And hopefully the ability to have the message bubbles be outlined instead of a solid color.
> it's still kind of a great way to die.

It sounds like a terrible way to die to me. But I guess to each his own.
Since March of 2015, apparently.
King of the Hill is the only reason I knew the Tom Landry question.
> In the U.S., it's pretty hard to avoid football.

I live in the US, in Texas, and I couldn't even begin to guess who is in the super bowl this year (assuming it hasn't already happened). I don't even try to avoid football, it just never crosses my attention. So, I wouldn't say it's hard to avoid football.
I had no clue what offsetting penalties or an option play were. I did know about fair catch and the Cowboys. I don't really follow any sports at all.
Would it be significant if a person already had low testosterone?
I would've expected the gothic arch to be more black.
...what if those others in your phone book don't want their numbers in Facebook's database? Or Google's?

It's becoming more and more important to remember that when you share your number with someone, you're really sharing it with the companies they sync their address book with. All of my contacts get uploaded to my Google account and end up being uploaded to Facebook as well. I fully expect that my number has been uploaded by others as well.
If I could install the Google dialer on my phone and drop the LG one, I would. But that's the only nonstock dialer I would install.
The main story will have a handful of times where there is an enemy to fight. Before those points there will be a dialog popup with what is basically a "skip the upcoming fight" choice.
Yep. I get traffic updates to a job I don't have. I should try manually setting the address to a place I do go regularly just so it'll be a little useful but I'm not certain that it won't get changed automatically.
I've tried that. It didn't work. Google just changes it back to where it thinks I work.
Google Now keeps deciding that I work at random places around town even though I am unemployed. No matter how many times I manually delete the work address, Google insists on filling it.
This should give you some ideas.

Personally, I would use [mp3DirectCut](http://mpesch3.de1.cc/mp3dc.html) to do this but that's mostly because I've used that program in the past.

I first knew it as the Digg effect.
Just came across a link to an article on businessinsider.com that I couldn't open.
awkwardmom.com works now but the other two still don't.
Seems to be just external sites. And mostly just stuff posted by the "Awkward Family Photos" page. But not all of the posts by that page are affected strangely enough. Links to awkwardfamilyphotos.com, awkwardmom.com, and someecards.com seem to be affected.
I'm 5'11", 230lbs and definitely fat.
Facebook likes to tell me that I need to enable Messenger to view messages even though I already have Messenger Lite installed.
Yep. Also works in Friendly for Facebook so that's the app I'm currently using but I would prefer to use Swipe because I like the overall UI better.
Some links still don't work for me. I can't open them no matter what I do. Interestingly, links to awkwardfamilyphotos.com never work. That's been the only constant I've been able to discern so far.
I'm noticing the same thing with links not always opening and notifications not being marked as read.
I just noticed this as well. Glad to see that at least I'm not the only one. I'm wondering if something changed on FB's side?
I'm not certain but are you saying he killed himself?
It's not so much that Snapchat "purposefully uses a low quality camera setting" but rather that instead of actually taking a picture it just takes a screenshot of the preview. I'm guessing the devs just didn't care enough to actually figure out how to take a proper picture on Android.
You're assuming that you masturbate more than they did.
Or are a woman, My wife gets a ton of surveys and I get maybe one every month or two.
Randall needs to be nerfed. He's too op, imho.
Dream Theater agrees with you.
You misspelled "worst, most overrated".
Subreddit styles remind me so much of the old Myspace days.
Mine doesn't vibrate when I unlock the phone. So I'm guessing there is a setting somewhere but I can't find one that makes mine vibrate.
You can't share pictures from your camera roll without reenabling storage permissions. Other than that I haven't found any side effects.
You mean the xposed module Snapprefs?
It's a pain in the ass to switch between two accounts though.

OMG, thank you! This is literally my only complaint with this phone so far. I'm going to go change that setting right now.

It's definitely not all since candy can make me feel full. But it doesn't last as long as something more nutritious.
I've actually tested this before. Your username doesn't update. So the people you are chatting with don't know that you changed your name.
All this tells me is that I need a better way to separate my actual music listening from my children's music. Either a more convenient way to toggle private session or an easy way to switch between accounts.
Re: bananas

There's a level called "The Chef" where you can trade steel bars for partial bananas, partial watermelon, and partial grapes. The return rate is pretty good too. It a few screens past where you first start getting bananas though so if you haven't gotten that far, you're out of luck.
Thanks. Yay for late nights binge watching Parks and Rec. Did you get my DM about the other issue I ran into?
Sure thing. Here you go. https://imgur.com/yQeTvkr
Okay, thank you. I finally got to 2500 spins and was trying to unlock the next spot and couldn't find where to get the hammers from. I'm glad to hear that I'm not crazy.

Edit: just checked the play store and the patch is indeed there. Yay hammers.
It is entirely possible that my Pixel Blacksmith save is bugged. I had to transfer it from my old phone and ever since then I've had some minor issues. I can send you the export if that would be helpful.
Looks like I got 90 Bronze Bar, 90 Bronze Secondary. My Pixel Blacksmith save is at prestige level 9 and level 205. Does that sound about right?
Settings > Display > Display Size

I have mine set all the way to the left (smaller icons and elements on screen to fit more). So far I haven't noticed any issues at all.
I still can't unlock the LS993 version right?
Nothing that I've noticed so far. But I may not be pushing it enough. I mostly browse and play games like Puzzle and Dragons.
I haven't had any issues with heat on my G6 yet. So far my only complaint is that I can't root it.
Thanks!
Thank you!
What is FFBE? I'm trying to find out about new games I might want to check out but when you use acronyms like this it's hard to know what I'm looking for.
Wouldn't they need to be advertising this fact for that to work though?
There was a plot twist?
And caused me to get banned. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
It worked for me for a long time on my Nexus 6. Unfortunately I'm on an LG G6 now and I can't root. Currently banned because I tried to use Casper without this method.
I love Emojione's look more than any other set. I'm sad that I can't root my G6 and use it anymore.
Yeah, using emoji switcher on a rooted phone or just manually replacing the file makes it systemwide, not app specific.
I still don't like them. When I had a phone that I could root I always replaced them with the Emojione font.
If you're rooted you can. But for non-rooted that isn't currently possible because the font files (including the emoji font) are system files.
Different platform's emojis are supposed to be just like using different fonts for text is. Doesn't change the meaning but just the aesthetics. If a particular emoji doesn't convey the intended meaning, then it's a failure just like a font that doesn't properly render the letter "e" would be.
Mario Run wouldn't show up for me either. My wife's phone (same phone, same Android version) showed both FE and Mario Run on the Play Store. I figured it was because I was rooted. Didn't realize this is a recent development.
Personally I'm currently using Yaata. I used Textra for a long time but just couldn't ever get it to look right for me. Yaata has the flexibility to look the way I want it to. I tried Pulse for a while too but so far Yaata has been the one that has kept me happy.
No lock icon. Check out the Dragon Gloves and Steel Gloves in this screen shot to see what I mean. http://i.imgur.com/yXU1f15.png
Having the super upgrade "Buy All From Market" enabled prevents the restock button from showing up when all vendors are sold out.
Is the grayed out item supposed to be locked? Because I get random items grayed out like that all the time and have no problem still selling them. There doesn't seem to be any consistency to which ones are gray either.
I haven't found a trader that sells bowls of water either.
Thank you!
Thank you. Follow up question, is the R4i Gold still the one to go with? That's what I seem to be seeing recommended most.
I just got a9lh+Luma on my N3DS XL thanks to the updated guide. I'm currently working on converting my cartridge games to cia's (yay, no more swapping cartridges) but noticed that my older DS cartridges seemingly can't be converted. My research indicates that I'm going to need a flash cart to be able to play those particular games. Is that still accurate? Or is there another way to do it? I'm currently on firmware 11.3 if that's important.
Thanks. I might be attempting this sometime soon. 
How would one go about writing the do nothing program? 
I had him for Calc I and really wished I could've taken him for Calc II. His accent is a little difficult to get used to but in spite of that he is a fabulous professor. He seems to really care that you understand the material. 
Only a week? That seems short.
What keyboard you are using is going to be key. Google Keyboard seems to have the best emoji support surprisingly. 
I have two daughters. One of them loves blue and red, the other green and blue. They both love Paw Patrol, one loves Ghostbusters, both love every Disney movie especially Frozen, both love gymnastics and dance. They like what they like and as long as they aren't killing each other or something I really don't care what that is. Some parents though get really ridiculous about those things and teach their kids to do the same. 
Everything works? Saving, unlimited viewing, etc? 
Which beta version have people had the best luck with? I'm currently on build 52 and it seems to work pretty well.
Haven't gotten a survey in two months. Location is on. :(
> Christianity has its own macabre appearing things.

All those examples and you didn't even have to mention that we turned the symbol of a torture/execution device into a common piece of jewelry. Just imagine people wearing electric chair necklaces because their religious leader was executed that way and you'll understand how strange a cross necklace can seem. 
Most days I say yes. On Tuesday I would've said no since Spotify decided to randomly delete all my offline tracks and I didn't have Internet at the time. But it usually works really well and saves quite a lot of data for me. 
> The limit is around 3500 songs.

3333 songs to be exact. Not sure why they chose such an arbitrary number. 
Thank you. I know there have been at least two threads here asking for a module to replace the FB emoji with system emoji. 
Unless there's a way to automate that it's going to get tedious and I'm going to end up not doing it. Right now I'm using [Smarter Playlists](http://smarterplaylists.playlistmachinery.com/go.html) to automatically create a playlist for my daily commute and Tasker automatically opens Spotify before I wake up so it can download the new songs on the playlist.
Good point. I have mine set to normal. Since I primarily listen through my car stereo I figured a higher quality wouldn't make a lot of difference but if OP needs the higher quality that is something to take into consideration. 
I have a playlist with 900 songs that I keep downloaded for my daily commute and Android reports that Spotify is using a little over 4GB of storage. I'm using a 32GB Nexus 6 and honestly pictures have been more of a space hog than any app. 
> 1) you can't mark it as "Download" to use offline which kind of sucks.

That's disappointing. I have a playlist already that serves the same purpose that I download for offline play for my daily commute (thanks Smarter Playlists). 10+ hours of streaming a week eats through a significant amount of my data plan so not being able to download the daily mixes is going to severely limit their usefulness for me.
I still don't have it. I have force closed the app multiple times and it still isn't showing up. :(

edit:
Finally at about 10:30am (CDT) I have the new Daily Mix.
What do the various columns mean? (e.g. SecurityMode, IsBackground, IsBrowser, etc)
I'm using Disa.im as a replacement for Facebook Messenger for now.
Not much. This one seems to have more items and I'm not sure if the 'recipes' are different or not. Basically they seem to be pretty much the same. 
That's a different version of the same basic game. [This game has its own app.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sometimeswefly.littlealchemy)
Personally I think they're ugly too. I wish we had the same option on Android that [iOS apparently has.](http://www.idigitaltimes.com/how-turn-facebook-messenger-emoji-company-adds-1500-new-emoji-latest-update-not-538169)
[Since I requested the same thing two weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/xposed/comments/4ux6yy/), I obviously support this request. I didn't go through the trouble of installing the EmojiOne font on my phone just to have Facebook's shitty emoji in my messages. Until there is a way to disable FB's emoji you could use Disa.im as a replacement for Facebook Messenger.
Well that's funny, I just found Leafpic yesterday on F-Droid. I really like it so far and really only would like one other feature. While I appreciate the ability to exclude folders, I would really like the ability to specify which folders Leafpic searches for albums. There are only two main folders that contain pictures I care to see in a gallery app and it would be easier to whitelist those two than to exclude/blacklist all the ones I don't want to see.
What I want though is to give some people view only access and other people edit access. And as far as I can tell, that still isn't possible to do.
Is there a way to allow my wife to add pictures but restrict relatives to only view? Because unless/until that's possible, the shared albums are basically useless for me. 
According to Google it's a term for an extreme case of sunburn.
Sounds kind of like the Buffy episode "[Normal Again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_Again)".
Wouldn't Emoji Switcher (from the play store) accomplish this? I used it to install EmojiOne and that's what I see in Google Keyboard.
"Degrade" or "demean" could also be used as synonyms to "dehumanize".
I crafted 1 and my inventory shows I got 2 while the stats only increased by one. So I'm not sure what's going on. I'm guessing the stats are actually correct while the inventory count is artificially inflated. 
Thanks. I think there may be a bug. I created another collection,  my stats say I crafted 11, my inventory says I have 14. Is the 2x crafted items super upgrade giving me extra collections? 
> 1.7.4: Fixed crafting multiple collections not updating stats. Fixed being able to apply more than max super upgrades. Minor UI fixes. Fixed Spider adventures. Reduced hero cost to 1/8th current, and minimum visits to 5. Added adventure success % to button. Fixed gem + powder helper tool quantities.

My stats list my collection count as 10 while I currently have 12. I think I created all (or at least most) of my collections after 1.7.4 but I could be wrong about that. Is there a way to refresh the stats so it properly reflects the collections I've got? 
Yeah, I thought so too but I never get the option to stop asking. I thought maybe I was overlooking something or maybe there was another way to accomplish that.
This is the dialog I see. http://imgur.com/dw9MRdd  It never gives me the option to not ask again.
Also, those of us who turn off custom styles in the preferences don't see it.
Are you sure he isn't?
[You're right, it did used to be an issue with worker tools.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelBlacksmith/comments/4iuype/bug_with_workers_prestige/)
That did help. Thank you!
I'm probably being dense but how do I actually select a hero? I paid the gold to unlock the slot on the heroes tab but I can't seem to actually select a hero (tapping the "Select hero" button does nothing). I'm guessing I need to unlock heroes somehow but the in-game help didn't seem to address that.
Looking forward to seeing that.
It's cats plural, so it can't be just one sore cat.
Shrug emoji. Nexus 6 with the newest version of the EmojiOne font which includes Unicode 9.0 emoji and I forgot not everyone would be able to view it.
Because WhatsApp is also Facebook, so we hate it? 🤷
No problem. It was my mistake, a misplaced tap on the screen. Thanks for the help.
I made the mistake last night and saw this morning that the game had updated so I was probably on 1.6.4 when I loaded the old game. Was the confirmation added in 1.6.5?

The save I accidentally loaded is dated May 24. I don't know what version that is but I've mostly been keeping updated so it should have been whatever was the current version that day.

The only thing I know for certain about the game I lost was that I was prestige level 6, level 348, and had 3 books completed. I think the books were the black, brown and yellow page books.
How about a confirmation when you try to load a save? Just accidentally loaded a level 8 save with no books completed over a level 348 save with three books completed. :( And now I'm getting crashes any time I try to open the stats screen to make sure I didn't also lose any prestige levels.
Thanks. I'm currently at prestige level 6 and level 348. I'm trying to decide it I want to prestige again to experience the game from level 1 with the new nerf but am a little worried that the xp reduction may be too much at prestige level 7.
According to the leaderboard you are at prestige level 11 or so. How's the newest version with the prestige nerf play at that level?

Thank you so much.
In your original post you said there are 5 wall designs. I'd like to see examples of those if you (or someone else) can provide a screenshot. I unfortunately can't download the world file because I am a console player.

Also, these builds are amazing. I'm thinking about trying to duplicate some of them in my world.
If the only people who use things like end to end encryption are the people who need it, it makes them stick out more to the organizations that are monitoring. You should use it even if you don't think you need to just to help the others blend in.

Having something to do with the food would be a nice addition. Consider me a vote in favor of a food tier at the furnace.
I would recommend crafting one ring with each of the gem types for giving to workers. This will give you another source for the gems you need. Also, I'm not sure if you know this or not but red enchants are not related to powder. You use the rubies for enchanting.
I'm on 1.4.5 and I don't see anything new in the upgrade screen. Could you maybe post a screen shot of what I should be setting, if you get a chance?
If somebody else posts about it in that sub, it's not self-promotion. ;-)
I'm not sure the rarity is too much of a problem. If you wanted to keep them really rare but add another source you could add a very small chance of obtaining them via an existing worker tool (eg when collecting gems have a 1% chance of also collecting a visage)
That's what I thought. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't overlooking another source. It's the one thing I seem to always be hiring for.
> 8. Hm, that's a good idea, using total value to balance visitor rewards. I need to think a bit more about this, I like the idea though.

I like this. Maybe make it a percentage of the value of what you sell to the visitor, with a bonus for selling them items that match their preferences.

PS: There is a typo one of the visitor messages. It says "AThe visitor leaves, minus...". Should just be "The", not "AThe".

Also, in the statistics screen, I'm showing 50/56 slots unlocked at level 149. I think it isn't counting the slots unlocked by being premium in this stat.

I'd say optional adverts is a good way to go. I like the idea of watching an optional ad to either restock the merchants for free, or for a gold bonus boost or to dismiss a pesky, too demanding visitor. 

Also, you should at least mention premium somewhere rather than having it hidden away in settings. I found it early on and bought it and I'm sure there would be other players that would do so if they knew about it.
> Fixed upgrades not being reset on prestige.

Aww, This makes me sad. I realize it was supposed to be this way from the beginning but upgrades not being reset was a pleasant surprise for my first prestige.

Having been playing for about 5 days now the only substantial feedback I have to offer is that the ability to sell from your inventory (instead of to visitors) should probably be nerfed or  disincentivised in some way. I don't know how casual or difficult you intend the game to be but being able to buy ore/bars from traders and craft a ton of daggers to then sell from inventory for a decent profit and exp boost seems like it runs counter to the intentions of the game. My suggestion would be that selling from inventory should not allow gold boosts from upgrades/prestige and should at most allow you to recoup the cost of the materials that went into the item being sold. It should probably actually be at a net loss instead of even at cost.
Just found an xposed module that seems to enable the suggestions in all text fields. It's called "Always Correct". So if you're rooted with xposed installed check it out.
Between this and the fact that I've grown accustomed to not having to type spaces after punctuation, I'm not sure I'm going to stick with Google Keyboard.
Does anybody happen to know if there is a way to have the keyboard always show suggestions? For some fields (like Firefox's address/search bar) Google Keyboard doesn't show the suggestions while SwiftKey does.
No problem. Just thought I'd mention it in case it wasn't already known.
When you unlock all the slots for an area, (eg anvil) you no longer seem to able to see how many items are queued.
This update supports emoji skintones and the new emoji from Android N (even though I'm only on 6.0.1 but have the font installed). Is this new? I've been on Swiftkey for a while now.
>No one wants 1000 small genre playlists so at some point a decision must be made "Do I put this into this genre or this other genre that is really similar?". Of course if you controlled where the simplification is yourself, you'd find it much less disagreeable.

Unfortunately, when it comes to organization of my music library I suffer from a sort of decision paralysis. So I was hoping there was some way to do it programmatically and take the decision making out of my hands.

Hmmm, I've found spotify to be one of the better services with regard to data usage.
So far this month Spotify has used 60 bytes background data and 1.28GB foreground (10+ hours a week streaming). I'm not sure why yours is using so much. Is this iPhone, Android, or other? Have you uninstalled and reinstalled? Contacted support to see if they can give an explanation? I use Spotify over Google Play mainly due to it being about a fourth of the data usage but if mine starts using too much like yours I'm not sure what I'm going to do.
Some initial feedback :

1. Personally, I don't like FAB's and the one in this app is no exception. I realize I'm probably in the minority there but I'd like an option to just not have it. 

2. I would like the ability to open a link directly without first opening its comments page. I usually do open the comments first but for some posts I want to open the actual content before the comments. RIF was able to solve this by making what opens dependent on whether you tap the thumbnail or title.

3. I'd like the option to open links in my external browser directly instead of first opening them in the internal browser.

4. I prefer dark backgrounds in my apps where possible and appreciate the option for night mode but I wish the contrast between background and text was a little higher.

Other than that, it seems pretty good so far. Text size seems larger than RIF and I don't know how that will work out for me. I'll have to use it for a while and see. 
This is the first time I've ever had gold. I feel like I should celebrate somehow.
Did he say "not enchantment?" It's been too long since I've played; guess my memory's a bit fuzzy.
Landon Rickets? He's actually involved in four missions in Mexico.
Possible very minor spoilers: My favorite is when you find him alone in a room, surrounded by dead darkspawn, and covered in blood and when Sandal is asked what happened his response is "Enchantment?".
Just tested, Snapchat still seems to detect screenshots. 
Blaine is a pain and that is the truth.
Spotify might but if they do they do a much better job than Google. It seems I'm going to have to stick with Spotify for now since Google's data usage is so ridiculously high. 
Radio.
Yeah, I actually tried that for a week but in order to download a good selection to cover what I may want to listen too required a lot of storage space. I may just have to stick with Spotify since it seems to be much lighter on data usage.
I think the "cache music while streaming" option saves the song it is currently playing to your device. From what I've read, Google Play Music downloads several songs at a time while streaming music and this is what ends up using so much data with no apparent way to prevent this.
Thanks, but I already have the quality set to it's lowest setting and it still eats data like I eat Oreo cookies.
> "if EVER I find a song..."

"If ever I" is another way of saying "whenever I" or "any time I". So basically mrckly is saying that whenever he finds a songs he likes on Discover Weekly, it gets saved to his playlist.
Fowl Language has a book coming out but I kind of doubt that's what they're referencing. 
Not OP but how would Minecraft run on the i7 Surface Pro 3?
> My usual reaction is "oh. Yup, sucks."

This is probably the best possible response. Similar in how I would respond to someone telling me they had cancer or diabetes or something. People who have been diagnosed with cancer don't need you to tell them what to do about it. Similarly, if I tell you that I have been dealing with depression for 15+ years, I don't need you to tell me what I should do about it. If I ask you what you think I should do, then you can tell me what you think I should do. Until then, just be sympathetic like a decent person.
But only if you actually mean it.
To be fair, there is a system in place for such cases that OP didn't use.

I kind of really wish this was available on console. Looks good. 
I'm glad you answered before I could because I would have gotten that one wrong. Guess it's time to read up on derangements.
Odds of getting them all correct at the same time should be about 1 out of 620,400,000,000,000,000,000,000. Assuming the left half of the list would stay the same, there would be 24! ways to order the right half. Only one of those is the correct order.
So I've been told. I'm actually kind of curious if going into it already knowing the story (and twist) would affect my perception of the movie at all.

There are a lot of movies that are immensely popular that I never got to see. The list of movies I haven't seen is surprising to a lot of people.

As far as I can tell, each item in your inventory seems to take up 5 bytes to store in the save file. 2 bytes for the item ID, 2 bytes for the quantity, one byte for the modifier. At least this is the case with the console version which is more or less the same as the PC version 1.2.2.

The console version is more or less at the PC version 1.2.2. So anything added after that is not in the console yet. As far as the Living Loom goes, that is added in 1.2.3.

I've used TEdit in the past to edit maps for the Xbox 360 version. I do not have the PC version at all. When TEdit loads and wants you to point it to the install directory, just pick anything and it will continue on.

That being said, to edit maps for the 360 required a map converter to convert between the 360 and PC versions so TEdit would read the file. I also had to use an older version of TEdit (one that was closer to the terraria version number that the console was on). And unfortunately a recent (or recent-ish) update added encryption to the console edition so the world converter no longer works and I can no longer transfer worlds between the 360 and TEdit.

Grey stucco doesn't paint well unless you use the deep paint. Green stucco is somewhat better while red and yellow stucco seem to paint pretty well.

The argument about tipping I never understood is that servers don't get paid much ($2.13) so they have to rely on tips. But

>An employer of a tipped employee is only required to pay $2.13 an hour in direct wages if that amount plus the tips received equals at least the federal minimum wage, the employee retains all tips and the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips. If an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages of at least $2.13 an hour do not equal the federal minimum hourly wage, the employer must make up the difference. [source](http://www.dol.gov/elaws/faq/esa/flsa/002.htm)

So a server shouldn't ever be making less than minimum wage ($7.25/hr), right?

“With each deed performed, for better or worse, a power is granted, a blessing or curse.” The problem is, I'm pretty sure trying to take over the kingdom counts as a curse-able deed so I don't know what Cedric thinks he's going to accomplish.
Both? He is living in the shadow of his father, Goodwin the Great's success and knows he cannot possibly live up to that. He is mostly a momma's boy but unfortunately his mother, Winifred the Wise, encourages Cedric to do the wrong thing to succeed. So when the amulet shows up he sees an opportunity to become as powerful as his father and given his mother's influence is not afraid to be bad in doing so. It's never really explained how the amulet is supposed to help Cedric take over the kingdom, though.

Beetle armor is not yet available on the consoles. But the turtle armor is and is pretty great for melee.

I don't think that's right. The Turtle Armor gives you an effect that is basically Thorns x 3 (i.e. Thorns reflects 1/3 damage, Turtle Armor reflects full damage). Also, I think wearing Turtle Armor is supposed to make enemies more likely to target you but if you're playing single player, I don't think that really has an effect.

I had several theories proposed to me. What I've settled on is that either there was just nothing interesting enough for my brain to bother remembering/recalling or there was some trauma/abuse that my brain refuses to recall. Given the relationship I have with my parents and a few things other family members have said, the trauma/abuse thing could be a real possibility but I've also heard that the brain usually doesn't suppress traumatic memories but rather fixates on them (e.g. PTSD). But you would also think that since when you are younger, everything is new, that there would be things that would have been strongly etched into my memory. So I really don't know. Maybe I just have terrible recall. I'll know in a decade if that 12 year mark has moved to 22 years.

> As for the Hamdrax, they changed the way the tools worked in 1.2, making the Hamdrax not make any sense. Had to change the name to Drax for that reason, since it couldn't work as a hammer and drill at the same time.

I still would like a tool that will remove both walls and foreground tiles like the Hamdrax used to. I understand they changed the functionality of the hammer and felt the need to remove the hammer abilities from the hamdrax, but I still miss having that all in one tool.
The console version is currently at 1.2.1.2 so every time I see an awesome build here on reddit and look to see what materials they used, it inevitably uses something introduced in 1.2.3. So that bothers me. The console needs an update so I can copy other people's cool builds.

Also, I wish an equipable light source other than the mining helmet existed. Preferably as an accessory. Making shine potions and using them every 5 minutes gets tedious, and the wisp is nice but tend to fly through walls and terrain leaving me in the dark.

Edit:
>PC: The Hamdrax was awesome for clearing out an area quickly since it removed blocks and walls at the same time. It'd be nice if something similar could be brought back (not sure if that's possible, though).

No, not really. One object, in this case person, can have multiple labels that identify it. Using any of those labels instead of another is not necessarily lying. If I say "I'm Razorsoup", I'm not lying because Razorsoup really is a label that identifies me even though I have another label/name given to me by my parents. Now, if you use that alias to do horrible, horrible things, than those things might be sins, but the alias itself is not.

Two underlines before and after text makes it bold. So this '\_\_test\_\_' would show up as '__test__'

To avoid that you would have to escape the underlines by putting a backslash before them.

*note: my first example had a backslash before each unscore to allow the underscores to show up instead of affecting the formatting.

*other edit: Three underlines makes it bold and italic, like yours is. One would make it just italic (not bold). These also work with asterisks instead of underscores. [Here is a good source for Reddit formatting rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cw70q/reddit_comment_formatting/)

That was not meant as an insult to you at all. Rather it was just a observation of the fact that the basic plot of that story would do nothing to make me want to read it but the fact that Stephen King wrote it overcomes that. Basically, I'm just saying that I believe that Stephen King can make even the most mundane sounding situation or story interesting.
If I didn't know that was a Stephen King story, your synopsis sounds like a stupid and boring story. Knowing that it is a Stephen King story I assume it was done really well and ends up being creepy as hell. Now I need to go find it and read it. I hope my professors will accept "I was reading a Stephen King story" as an excuse for why my homework is late.

Congrats? For what? I didn't get one, my account is only 1 year old. I've got ten years before I get to collect that particular familiar. KoL is not particularly forgiving to completionists.
It's a familiar, the [Miniature Sword & Martini Guy](http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Miniature_Sword_%26_Martini_Guy]).
What rumors?
Looking at the [highest scoring post of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/), I calculate 23950 upvotes and 2082 downvotes (score = 21868 and percentage = 92%). Looking at a cached version of that page, it used to show 26755 upvotes and 4878 downvotes. Unless my math is wrong, that seems to mean approximately 5600 of those votes were probably from vote fuzzing and/or spam. That's 17.7% of the votes that were displayed.
In your example of a comment with 15/-4, the only thing you can be certain of is that there are at least 11 upvotes and eight other votes that may be real or completely fabricated/spam. With the new system, you can still be certain that there are at least 11 upvotes. The only thing you are losing is the information about how many other votes there are. But unless there was a way to tell if those votes were actually users voting or just spam/vote fuzzing, did you really lose much?
> And who cares if 4 downvotes are from vote fuzzing?

I presume you might care since you said that

> there were no discrepancies about how 15 people upvoted and 4 people downvoted

My question is, can you actually be certain there are no discrepancies with the data RES was showing given the admins constant statements that reddit fuzzes those numbers?
> You're just using factors of 100, no fucking duh the percentage won't be the same. Voters don't divvy out in fucking hundreds, that's stupid to assume. Numbers could be anything.

Please provide an example of what the numbers could be to provide a score of 69 and percentage of liked of 84% with hundreds of votes as you claimed there are. I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume my math could be wrong but I just don't see how it is. So perhaps you could provide an example for me?

> RES was not wrong about the numbers, especially in small subs there were no discrepancies about how 15 people upvoted and 4 people downvoted. The admins, specifically Deimorz, are spreading that shit lie to give reason for the change.

But even in a small sub, could you be certain that those four downvotes were from actual users? Could you be sure that the 15 upvotes weren't really 11 real + 4 added by reddit's vote fuzzing to counteract bots downvoting the comment? Or that the downvotes weren't added to counteract people using bots to upvote comments? When the admins have said for a long time that those numbers are not reliable, what is it about small subreddits that makes those numbers more reliable?
> This post is much higher than just 85. There are hundreds of votes but we can't see that now because of the fucking new changes in place.

Let's assume you're right. Lets assume that this post is actually at 169/-100. That would put the percentage at 63% liked. Or at 269/-200 it would be 57%. In fact, the higher the number of votes and closer to zero the score is the closer to 50% the percentage is. So if you are correct, then either the score or percentage is still terribly wrong, or the assumption I made about how they are computed is wrong.

> As someone who didn't use RES you don't really know how it's affected those who did use it, and clearly you don't realize how many people actually vote on shit.

My not using RES doesn't really have any bearing on the changes with posts since AFAIK, RES only changed the way comment scores were displayed. But from my understanding, the numbers RES was showing previously were wrong and basically completely fabricated anyways weren't they? So how is this change such a big issue for RES users? I honestly don't understand how being lied to less is so upsetting.
> You can't view this for comments or else I wouldn't care.

Most users never could view this for comments. Those users who were using an addon to view this information were viewing false information. I'm not entirely sure why people are upset that reddit is lying to them less now.
For what it's worth, this change doesn't bother me at all. I don't use RES or any similar add-ons so comments haven't changed at all for me. And the false information for posts was just pointless since it had no real bearing on reality.

This change may actually make it easier to determine the number of upvotes/downvotes a post has. If one can assume that the score on a post is equal to the number of upvotes + the number of downvotes and that the percentage is equal to the number of upvotes / the total number of votes and both of those numbers are fairly accurate, it's fairly trivial to get an estimate of the upvotes and downvotes. For example, this post currently has a score of 69 and a percentage of 84% liked. From that, I estimate 85 upvotes and 16 downvotes have occurred. Of course that can only be confirmed by an admin and I may be wrong in how the score and percentage are calculated or just completely wrong altogether.

 Dear ACC Faculty, Staff, and Students,

First, I sincerely apologize for the changing notices.  The weather and road conditions changed quickly, and unfortunately, exactly during the morning commuter period.  ACC, along with the city, county, University of Texas, and numerous school districts had decided around 3:00 a.m. this morning to operate on a regular schedule due to favorable weather reports and after frequent conference calls with meteorologists, emergency management officials, city and county transportation officials, etc.  However, conditions have changed, and the roads are not good.  ACC campuses and centers will be closed for the rest of today.  ACC Police Department officers are at all campuses.  If you already are at a campus, please go inside and stay until it is safe to return home.  The roads are heavily trafficked with delays.  We anticipate opening tomorrowon a regular schedule.  Please check the ACC homepage for the latest information.  I will continue to keep you updated.

  I take my kindle with me to school to read between classes and at lunch. Now of course you could take a physical book with you to do the same but I currently have approx. 100 books on my kindle. So if I am reading a book and decide it's just not worth finishing I just go pick another one to start. Also, the kindle is smaller and lighter than most books I would want to take with me, so it is easier to haul around.

  As far as reading fatigue, I haven't noticed any difference between my kindle 4 and a paper book. I read for fairly long periods of time on my kindle and haven't had any eye strain issues.

  Personally, I would only recommend the kindle for novel type books. Books that you would want to flip back and forth between pages (e.g. encyclopedias, religious texts, textbooks) can be a bit of a hassle and I feel paper books are still the better option here. But for books you just plan to read straight through, it works really well.

For NV: I bought the Complete edition for less than the cost of all of the DLC combined so look into that before you buy individual DLC. My ranking and thoughts on each DLC for NV are: (I tried not to spoil anything, sorry if I did anyways)

1. Old World Blues: By far the most fun of the DLC in my opinion. Story is pretty crazy, characters are fun to interact with and this DLC includes my favorite sniper rifle. You can bring anything you can carry into the DLC, cannot leave until the DLC is finished but can return anytime after the DLC is finished.

2. Lonesome Road: Provides a lot of back story for your character. I don't really care/like any of my companions but this DLC made me actually care about one of them. If you thought the Mojave was desolate, the Divide is worse. Quite a bit of radioactive areas. Finishing the DLC rewards you with my one of my favorite light armors. You can bring any gear with you, can leave at any time and return at anytime.

3. Dead Money: Interesting story, the cloud provides an different challenge, ghost people slightly harder to kill than your average enemy. You cannot bring any of your gear with you, cannot leave until the DLC is over and cannot return after you leave. This DLC can be quite rewarding materially if you put some effort into it.

4. Honest Hearts: I did not like this one at all. I'm not sure why but it felt more like a slightly longer quest than an expansion to me. But this DLC does include my favorite pistol. You can bring a limited amount of gear with you, cannot leave until the DLC is over and can return after you leave.

Edit: Gun Runners' Arsenal adds some great weapons and weapon mods. 

Courier's Stash (which is basically all four pre-order DLC) adds some weapons, armor and other items but most of the added content is better for a low level player/earlier in the game. The Vault 13 canteen is probably the only non-consumable item that you would keep for most of the game.
Hmmm...I haven't had any problems with the inventory reseting. I'm on the Xbox, fully patched, all DLC. According to [this](http://www.falloutwiki.com/Talk:Sink_Central_Intelligence_Unit#Maybe_it_does_restock) it may depend on how many caps he has.
Buy ammo, step outside on the balcony, wait 4 days(has to be in the Big MT but not in the Sink), go back inside The Sink and he should have restocked. Repeat as needed. That's about the only advice I can give for purchasing ammo. That or you could cheat with console commands or an inventory editor.
Why is the Sink CIU useless in this regard? He sells ammunition and repairs equipment to 100%.
On a scale of 1-10 asshattery, that would probably rank about 6 or 7. But I'm not an expert asshat, so take that estimate with a grain of salt.

No. OP seems to have submitted a link to the front page instead of a self post.
Which Courier's Duster? There are 4 different ones you could get.

Personally, I like Ulysses' Duster w/ the 1st Recon Beret. Total weight of 4, DT of 13, and +10% crit chance. I would use the Elite Riot Gear but with the Travel Light, Light Touch, and Tunnel Runner perks, I seem to be better off with light armor.
That's what I'm a little worried about. Would it definitely break the expansion? Or could he just "coc NVDLC03TheSink" back to the Sink and continue the OWB quest from there when he's ready?
Diet did have caffeine. I'm 99% sure of it.
Are you playing on the Xbox360 or PC? 

If you're on the PC, you could try to [open the console](http://www.falloutwiki.com/Fallout:_New_Vegas_console_commands) and use the command "coc Goodsprings" which should/might teleport you to Goodsprings. What I don't know is if that will cause any issues with OWB when you are ready to play it.

If you are on the 360, the only thing I can think that might work would involve editing your inventory to give yourself an [item](http://www.falloutwiki.com/Big_Mountain_Transportalponder!) that you're supposed to get at the end of OWB that allows you to travel between the Mojave and the Big MT. Again, I'm not sure if that would affect the story for OWB if you were to do that. This process would involve a USB flash dirve, [Horizon](http://www.xboxmb.com/horizon/), and [FalloutNVVE](http://zeropair.com/falloutve/)

Or you could restart your game.
I finally figured out how to move items in FO:NV on the 360. I'm about 80% through my first playthrough. I never really had any reason to move anything so I never really looked to see how to do it but I accidentally discovered how the other day.
Hold down the button you use to call up the pipboy. It will turn the light on instead of opening the pipboy.
I am currently playing through Fallout:New Vegas for the first time, almost finished, and I am enjoying it a lot. I played Skyrim and Oblivion before playing FO:NV and really enjoyed both of them as well.

If you decide to play New Vegas, I would recommend getting the Ultimate Edition that comes with all the DLC. When I got it, it was cheaper than the cost of the DLC so you should save some money by going that route. And DLC is definitely worth playing (at least the three I've played so far were fun).
There is one in Fallout:NV. IIRC, it was a badly damaged door, in the open position, locked and the hallway beyond the door was blocked by rubble.
That's not cheating, that's called strategy.

[I built this one in my world](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xICgwXqrOYY). It took me a few tries to actually get it built but when I finally got it right, it worked great. This one actually pauses until you mine the cobblestone so the pistons don't get jammed.
Ah yes. That is actually a fairly common problem since obsidian is made from lava & water. The [wiki page on obsidian](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Obsidian#Safer_mining) has some methods on safely mining obsidian.

>I think I need to somehow get under the lava and drain it.

You are right that you need to deal with the lava underneath the obsidian. The best way to do this is to use water. Basically, you place water in such a way that when you mine the obsidian, the water will fill that hole. If there is lava underneath, it will be turned to more obsidian before the one you just mined drops in and gets destroyed.
>...but that's because I can't figure out how to successfully mine the obsidian.

You have to use a diamond pickaxe to mine obsidian. And it takes approximately 18 seconds to mine each block.

This is exactly my views of the books as well. I really liked the first one, but had a really difficult time with the second one.

Personally, I would say if you didn't enjoy the first one, you probably won't enjoy the series as a whole. If you enjoy the first one but the second one isn't as enjoyable, give book 3 a try before giving up on the whole series.

I'm not sure, really. I'm also not sure that using a gold hoe is actually any faster than just using your fists. Mining stone with a hoe results in cobble not dropping. So far the only blocks I have tried that have worked are dirt, sand, gravel, and trees. But trees take a while for the hoe to mine, so I don't know if there is really any speed benefit to using a gold hoe over your fists.

I deleted the post because I realized I should have done some more testing first before I posted but you apparently replied rather quickly and before I deleted it. Sorry about that.
Well, it's pseudo-random. A specific seed will always give you and everybody else on the same Minecraft version the same world generation.

That's true, the directions for Simply Sleep state
>Adults & Children 12 years and over: take 2 caplets at bedtime if needed or as directed by a doctor 
>Children under 12 years: do not use

If your 10 year is having sleep issues severe enough to warrant giving them Benadryl as a sleep aid then you really need to see his doctor.
I've never taken more than the recommended dosage of Benadryl. I have taken it for both a sleep aid and for allergy relief. I have not ever become dependent on it as a sleep aid though. But I am only one person with an anecdote and one anecdote is not the same thing as scientific research.
That's interesting, those two articles seem to be slightly contradictory. In one they discuss the rehabilitation of a patient who is abusing Benadryl and in the other they find that Benadryl use doesn't exhibit symptoms suggestive of drug dependence. I wonder if abuse is more a psychological issue and less a chemical dependance issue.
That's true. Habit is a very broad term, where addiction is a lot more specific. My friend actually works in addiction medicine. He explained to me one day that my "addiction" to caffeine wouldn't actually qualify as an addiction because a key factor in addiction is the inability to quit in spite of adverse affects of the behavior. Since there are no adverse affects to my caffeine use (at least currently) it wouldn't really be an addiction. It is a strongly ingrained habit though.
Oh, I agree. Which is why I said
>I think he should take the advice of the posters who said to consult with his pediatrician to see if there is a medical reason for it (which I highly doubt) and to then seek some legal counsel.

The reason I doubt there is a medical reason for it is because they also give benadryl to the dog. That's just a big red flag to me.
I'd be curious what a doctor would say about using Benadryl for longer periods. 

It's not Benadryl but I take Omeprazole pretty much daily for acid reflux. The packaging says to take it for two weeks and then wait like three months before taking any more. I asked my doctor about that since he was the one who suggested it and he said it's basically a liability thing. If you are taking an OTC medication to treat something that doesn't get better with treatment, it could be a symptom of a larger issue that needs medical attention.
Oh, I seriously doubt OP's son needs a sleep aid. I think he should take the advice of the posters who said to consult with his pediatrician to see if there is a medical reason for it (which I highly doubt) and to then seek some legal counsel.

I was just curious if ironyCurtain had a source for their claims since they are in direct contradiction to advertising and everything I've ever read on Diphenhydramine.

FWIW, a doctor friend of mine has told me that melatonin is the best sleep aid to use, when it works. Unfortunately it is not effective for everyone.
Yes they do. Don't sleep in a bed in the nether.
>Benadryl...may be addictive....not intended to be a sleep aid, though it can make you drowsy.

I'm curious if you have a source for this as Benadryl (or Diphenhydramine) is often marketed as a non-habit forming sleep aid. Take for example [Tylenol Simply Sleep](http://www.tylenol.com/product_detail.jhtml?id=tylenol/pain/prod_ss.inc&prod=subpss)
http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Tree_farm

Here you go. When building my underground tree farm, this is the resource I used the most. I made my roof 8 blocks above the floor to limit the height of the trees that grow so I can harvest them from the ground. Glowstone in the ground will provide the light needed for the saplings to grow. You don't have to put any light sources in the wall or ceiling if you don't want to. Just have to have a high enough light level at the saplings for the trees to grow.
I just saw this episode on TV a few minutes ago.
This doesn't work on the Xbox. :(
Yeah, a number of years ago I was looking for a wallpaper changer and I tried just about everything I could find. John's Background Switcher did everything I wanted at the time where everything else failed on some point or another. Unfortunately, it isn't OS but that wasn't a requirement for me. I'll have to check Wally out again sometime and see if it does what I need and see if it does it better than JBS.
The overworld map is limited to 864x864. You'll notice the coordinates at the top or your in game map only go from -432 to 432.

Unfortunately since the nether is 1/3 the size of the overworld, this means that the nether is limited to only 288x288. I think that is the size constraint that will really be limiting to future updates.
I started 2 three times and all three time my save file ended up getting corrupted. The game was decent but not good enough to warrant trying a fourth time.
I've been using [John's background switcher](http://johnsadventures.com/software/backgroundswitcher/) for years now.
The Xbox version limits the overworld size to 864x864. It also changes the ratio of the overworld to the Nether from 8:1 to 3:1. This means that the nether is effectively 1/3 the size of the overworld. In other words, on the Xbox the Nether is limited to 288x288.

You could travel to the nether to collect lava. There's usually plenty of lava there.  Also, I don't know if this still works but according to the [wiki](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Lava#Infinite_lava_duplication):

>In the ported Xbox 360 Edition, lava (as of 5-20-12) can be easily duplicated with a glitch in the following manner A 2x1 depression is mined out of dirt, and a bucket of lava is poured against the back "wall" of the depression. Once the lava begins to glow, it can be scooped back into the bucket. After a few frames, the lava will reappear in the depression while also being in the bucket. Both are source blocks that can be placed and collected. It should be noted that occasionally this method just destroys the source block.
My computer doesn't have audio and I'm not very redstone proficient so I have one question. What's the purpose of the clock under the floor?

Based on that, I would expect a bug fix patch in August and an actual update in September. But of course, that's only if they hold to the same pattern that they have been.
The in-game map. The X and Z cords only go from -432 to 432. I was surprised when the update that included the cords came out because I thought the world was 1024x1024 but it seems to actually be a bit smaller.
Yes, you can put glass blocks over a chest and still be able to open the chest.

It gets changed in 1.9pre6. Until then, mining a stair block will yield the stair's source material. It sucks, but that's the way it works. On the plus side, the materials we can make stairs out of are at least renewable.

Hmm...I tried using something like this but I couldn't get it to work. I'll have to try again later. I suck at redstone so I probably just messed something up the first time.
I've been trying to find something that works but no luck so far. Everything I've tried so far ends up burning out the torch or it's too slow to work. I'm not very good with redstone so I might be missing something obvious though.
Yes it does. I imagine it'll get patched eventually but it works for now. I hold down the left trigger while facing the lever and out comes the sand.
[Sand and Gravel generator](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBsoOx8sYeE) - I built one of these in my world and it works perfectly. All the sand I could ever want. And since sand is used to craft sandstone and glass, I also have an unlimited supply of those as well.
I was so glad when I found out I could do this. My current spawn doesn't have nearly enough sand, but now I have an unlimited supply of it.

That doesn't work for the Xbox version. The [wiki](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Lava#Infinite_lava_duplication) does have a method that may work though.

>In the ported Xbox 360 Edition, lava (as of 5-20-12) can be easily duplicated with a glitch in the following manner A 2x1 depression is mined out of dirt, and a bucket of lava is poured against the back "wall" of the depression.

Since you haven't told us what model it is, you could also have the owner give you that information along with the books that are on it. Just one more piece of information to help confirm who the real owner is.
Saplings just need a light level of at least 9 in the block above the sapling in order to grow. Any light source will work. I just use glowstone because I'm less likely to destroy it while harvesting the trees. I would end up knocking half the torches down each time and putting them back up would get old. My tree farm is just a repeating pattern laid out like so: (S=sandstone, G=glowstone, T=tree)

    SSSSS
    SGSTS
    SSSSS
    STSGS
    SSSSS

I used to have the trees closer together but I kept getting glitches with leaves not displaying but still blocking the path. So far, I haven't had that as much with the current setup.
I made a grid of glowstone and dirt in a room hollowed out from a mountain. There are eight blocks of air space from floor to ceiling. Since trees usually grow with two levels of leaves at the top, that means the tree trunks are all 6 blocks or less tall. Just high enough to be able to mine the whole tree trunk from the ground. The glowstone provides the light the saplings need to grow. It has worked for me so far. And I am never in need of saplings because the decaying leaves drop more than enough.
This has been up for at least three years now. If they are collecting data, how much longer would it need to be up?
Pretty sure the world is only 864x864. I can only get to +/-432 according to the coordinates displayed on the map.

Are you playing on a console or PC? If you are playing on a PC, there are mods that will fix the messed up leveling system in Oblivion. Unfortunately, I don't know which ones to recommend as I am on a console myself. If you are playing on a console, you should read [this wiki page](http://uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Leveling) to understand how leveling works and how to best level up.

I'm currently playing through Oblivion as well. Here are a few things I've learned that may be of use to a mage character.

Armor will decrease your spell effectiveness. When you become a master of that armor class, your spell effectiveness will still only be at 95% if you have any armor equipped. Clothing does not affect your spell effectiveness. Unfortunately, there is only one enchantable piece of clothing that you can wear on your wrists and that is the wrist irons.

If you equip a shield and either a two-handed weapon or no weapon (i.e. hand to hand) you will still benefit from the shield's enchantment without the spell effectiveness penalty. You also won't get the boost in armor rating from the shield, though.

When choosing clothing, wearing a separate shirt & pants instead of an outfit or robe will give you an extra slot for an extra enchantment.

Shield enchantments will raise your armor rating. So enchanting several pieces of clothing with shield enchantments can give the same protection as armor. Using elemental shield enchantments (fire, frost and shock shield) will raise your armor rating and offer protection from those elements.

You might want to check [this out](http://uesp.net/wiki/General:Differences_Between_Morrowind,_Oblivion,_and_Skyrim) for more of the differences between Skyrim and Oblivion.

To me, the article seemed to say that these categories don't cross but that doesn't seem logical to me. I would think something could be both "sophisticated" and "mellow" at the same time. But maybe I misunderstood the article.
While I appreciate the support, I think brerrabbit has a valid question. Most people who say they like "anything but country" have never really listened to jazz, classical, celtic, blues, etc. Asking about specifics can help to narrow down what they really mean.
There's just a quality to country music that I don't like. I can't really describe it. I'm not denying that there are/were some really talented people in country music. I just don't happen to like what they do with that talent. 

There is one Johnny Cash song I like but it's a cover of a NIN song so I'm not sure if that really counts.
I must be odd because I like classical, jazz, instrumental, rock, punk, metal, and a very small amount of rap. But I have never heard a country song I like.

I got it in late December, put 300 hours into it and when I finished all the quests I was at level 80. I only had two skills that weren't maxed.
It's like life. You think you have all these "choices" but in the end there is only one ending.
Yep. Finding something to disenchant was a pain though. Only thing that took longer to find was waterbreathing.
I actually prefer to custom enchant boots with muffle. That way you get full muffle instead of just half. I use the Worn Shrouded Boots with muffle and fortify sneak.
But they have super hearing so muffle is a necessity.
I have 8 so far and they're all essential. I've finished the quest with Frost already. And I can't disable the clones because I am on Xbox 360.
1. Save game.  
2. Kill shopkeeper.  
3. Load save from first step.  
4. Because of odd caching stuff, shopkeepers inventory will be reset even though it was empty when you saved.
The four missing students are found scattered around Skyrim. 

[Yisra](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Yisra) was a Redguard student enrolled at the College of Winterhold. Her charred corpse can be found in a circle of scorched earth east of Dawnstar, along the shore immediately south of Yngvild.

[Rundi](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rundi) is a dead Nord found near an altar at an unmarked location east-southeast of Winterhold.

[Borvir](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Borvir) is a mage found dead at Journeyman's Nook, killed by a Bandit.

[Ilas-Tei](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ilas-Tei) is dead in the arctic reaches between Ysgramor's Tomb and Septimus Signus's Outpost, next to a Shrine of Talos.

Homesick was the first thing I thought of from reading the description. I understand that you can feel homesick without leaving the country. I do agree with Syke042, 'culture shock' is very similar to what you describe. But according to jipijipijipi, dépaysement seems to be more of a positive thing, something you'd seek out, so like a positive culture shock.
So it's a positive feeling? I did not get that sense from the article. They should have let you write the description of 'dépaysement'.

Edit: write/right typo

I would use the reddit FAQ over a Google Doc, personally. No real reason except that we are already on reddit, might as well use the tools they offer.

Since you created this subreddit, what were you hoping it would become? I think it would be good to include some sort of description in the sidebar of what kind of posts we are looking for or maybe a definition of what "Selftracking" is.
I have found Firefox to be as fast as Chrome, uses less memory and is more capable of doing what I need. I have wondered why people say Firefox is slow and bloated and Chrome is fast and light since my experience has always been the opposite.

I actually remember reading that exercise is more effective at treating depression than medicine. I don't remember where I read that, but I'm pretty sure it was on reddit.

It is possible that the horrible physical health is contributing to the anxiety. I'm not judging, I also have horrible physical health and I suffer from major depression. I am starting an exercise regimen to hopefully help alleviate the symptoms.

No, you don't need counseling. You are entitled to like whatever you want.

Why would you want to hide your comments? It seems to me that that would defeat the purpose of commenting.
Edit: Apparently I did not read the question closely enough. I did not realize you were talking about r/all. The following is not relevant to your question. 

1. Go here: http://www.reddit.com/reddits/mine

2. Find the subreddit in question in the list.

3. Click the red button labeled "- frontpage" to the left of said subreddit. That button should turn green and should now be labeled "+ frontpage"

You should also be aware that it is possible that [random subreddits will be shown on your frontpage if you are not subscribed to at least 50](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/gl0d4/display_all_of_my_subreddits_in_the_my_reddits/c1od5s5).  I've never been that low and have never seen an admin comment on that so personally, I'm not 100% sure it actually works that way.

One profile specifically states that it is the alt of the other. And they are both in the same group. I know some of our members have caught some flak for having multiple alts in the same group but I didn't know if we wanted to actively keep track of other characters doing the same.

GK/PKers are easier to spot and keep track of so it would probably be good to limit to that.
Edit: Should have finished reading the thread before commenting. Just realized someone else already made this same point.

The part that seems a bit silly to me is the fact that having two alts in separate groups doesn't actually prevent you from still sharing that information. And if both groups are pro-survivor, then both accounts will still be working for the same goals anyway.

I'm not arguing because I want to have all of my accounts in one group (I only have the one) but rather pointing out what seems to be a rather silly reason for having this restriction.

This is just the first example that comes to mind as I ran into this at work once while trying to get support from 3ware. These addresses used to not forward and were still different. I assume 3ware was bought out by LSI, hence the forwards now.
I played the original on the N64. I could never get used to the control scheme and hated every minute of playing that game. 
I have played Goldeneye. It was crap. I never understood people's obsession with that game.
http and https do not necessarily have to point to the same page or be the same content. for example:

For most cases this would be okay but there may be a few fringe cases where you would be wrong to assume both addresses are referencing the same thing.
"Least worst" to me usually means all of the options were bad so I went with the best of the terrible options. It's a quick way of conveying that while I went with the best option, even that was terrible.

That's actually why I want to find one. I'd like the option to repair those buildings when I come across them. I have the construction skill, might as well use it to it's fullest potential.
It wasn't my original intention to get those skills first but the situation called for it at the time. My plan is to get the first aid skill next. I have the construction skill which helps with barricading but I haven't found a toolbox yet. That'll be the next thing I need to find. I could also use some more FAKs. We always need FAKs.
No, it explains why you're not worried about it, not why you didn't know about it. You didn't know about it because you don't use OpenDNS. I think this may be why people are downvoting you.
I am currently alive in Shore Hills. The only useful supplies I currently have are 2 FAKs. Roftwood seemed to be pretty active when I was there but the wiki shows that it currently is at a very dangerous level.

As far as group planning goes, I vote we use [/r/reddit_survivors](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit_survivors/) to do our planning and strategies. Since it is restricted we won't have to worry about other groups finding it and seeing what our plans are. Maybe I'm a little too paranoid though.

I think we should keep [/r/reddit_dead](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit_dead/) available for any redditors who want to play as dedicated zeds. Right now it does seem that most of us prefer to be dedicated survivors but that may change in the future.

And I agree with xOMutleyOx. We do need more communication. Would reddit be a good place to do that communicating or would it be better to try to use in game tools to do that?

I was infected. Luckily I was 2 blocks from a hospital and I was able to find a FAK. Was also able to find an axe in a nearby fire station. I should be good to go assuming I don't die while sleeping. I also found two radios. Are they actually useful for anything?
I was dead, just got revived at a factory in Roftwood. I may be infected but I'm not sure. How would I tell?
I don't even use Greasemonkey. Never found anything important enough to install it for. The DSS Satellite Phone may be the thing that finally convinces me. Maybe.
There's simply nothing about it that makes me want to install both Greasemonkey and RES. Nothing against those that find it useful, I just don't personally see any need.

I had considered doing fewer running segments and adding more in over time or running on a treadmill to force my pace to be slower. I hadn't considered shortening the running segments. Thanks for the idea. I currently walk for 30-60 minutes, three times a week so week 1 should be doable. It's my lungs that can't keep up. By the time the next running segment comes up I'm still struggling to breath.
Allow users to vote on which is the better title, the one pulled from the article or the one supplied by the user. Possibly have this vote affect karma received from the post.

There is Reddit Enhancement Suite that Neoflare mentioned.

There is also a [bookmarklet](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/related/aq8ak/bookmarklet_to_show_all_images_on_a_reddit/) that could help.

The Android app for Running Ahead (Handy Runner) seems to be a lot less accurate than Runkeeper. A 1.5 mile route was measured as [2.04 miles by Handy Runner/Running Ahead](http://www.runningahead.com/maps/06a363b67a0648359c08ee0dfcc2bfdd?unit=mi). The same route as measured by [Runkeeper is 1.67 miles](http://runkeeper.com/user/razorsoup/activity/39408331). They both end up being longer due to the errors caused by inaccuracies in the GPS data but Runkeeper seems to be able to minimize that error better. I'm guessing they do some sort of smoothing of the data where Running Ahead probably doesn't.
You can export a gpx file of your runs in Runkeeper.
In case it still isn't clear, he would prefer small subreddits with a few high quality posts instead of large subreddits with a lot of crap.

That's what I thought. Never feeling that feeling again just might be enough reason to try keto.
>...sometimes people refer to the craptacular feeling you get when your blood sugar is dropping

If I go too long without eating (more than about 6-8 hours) I feel very weak and shaky. Is that the "craptacular feeling" you are talking about?
I always use April 31st as a fake date. It seems to take people longer to figure out that it's not a real date.
I started playing about a month ago, died within a few days and have been a zombie since. I haven't seen very many survivors and [the suburb map in the wiki](http://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php/Suburb) seems to be perpetually dominated by orange and red.

Inception. I watched it with my wife and two of our friends and none of us could hear the dialog clearly. The music/sound effects were too loud for us to turn the volume up any more so we were forced to use the subtitles.
I have an android phone and I usually use my pointer finger.

Okay, I was trying to figure out what I was missing here. Thanks for clarifying.
>an average of 28.9 hours/day

I'm sorry but how is this possible. I think there are only 24 hours/day.
I'm not sure it really matters as long as there is cancer, kids and animals involved.
My wife works in fundraising and she quickly learned the three easiest things to raise money for are kids, animals, and cancer. So the absolute best thing to raise money for is kids w/ pets w/ cancer.
They won't know which one to focus on so they'll focus on none. This plan is brilliant.
I wasn't expecting that. I saw something totally different in that image.

AFAIK, you will always have fifty subreddits on your front page at a time. If you are subscribed to less than 50, the system will add some of the larger subreddits to fill out the list. If you start subscribing to more subreddits these others will no longer appear on your front page.
I kind of prefer [this one](http://i.imgur.com/oNWww.gif) that was submitted about a month ago. It just seems a little easier to read and understand to me.
My wife has this same problem. We have watched some pretty terrible movies but there have been very few that we didn't finish. 'The Constant Gardener' was one of those few.
There is only one CU in the town I live. They have more fees and higher fees than my bank.
Either these are getting easier or I'm getting better.
Not saving them to Google is an option? My phone doesn't give me a choice. It saves all contacts to my Google account. 
I transferred contacts from my old phone to my new Android phone via bluetooth. You might check to see if that's an option. 
I'm not sure I understand how this applies to the current discussion. Could you elaborate please?

I find that contrast bothers me more than anything. I typically go with dark, low contrast wallpaper.
Could be except that I don't smoke so it doesn't explain my case.
Also, in your preferences there is an option named "don't show me sites with a score less than X". You might want to check to see what that is set to. The example link you provided currently has a score of -6 (2 upvotes, 8 downvotes) so if you have that set to something higher you won't see the link.
Would this help explain why I close the reddit tab, open a new tab, type reddit.com?
I had 13 misses in a row today. At 25% hit rate there is only a 2% chance of missing that many times in a row. Kind of frustrating. And before anyone asks, no, I do not have any alts in the same suburb. I don't even have any alts at all.

Edit: Just had six more misses. Now up to 19 misses in a row. That's a 0.4% chance of happening.
The original [Gravitee](http://www.kongregate.com/games/FunkyPear/gravitee) was a golf game. I believe you are thinking of [Gravitee Wars](http://www.kongregate.com/games/FunkyPear/gravitee-wars).
I'm going to have nightmares now. Thanks.
I always make sure to return to my safe house before running out of AP. I can't find any non EHB resource buildings so far so I have resorted to attacking zombies with a cricket bat for XP. Not that effective but it's something.
Thanks. The only VSB building I've found so far is the bank I spawned in. Right now there are three of us in here but two of us are complete noobs. If I understand correctly, healing would be a great way for me to gain XP but I can't seem to find any non EHB resource buildings in my suburb so I've resorted to attacking stray zombies with a cricket bat.
I'm glad to hear there are still people playing because this seems like a fun game. Unfortunately I made my class choice before I read the Wiki so I'm kind of stuck. But I'm going to continue on with my consumer and see what happens. Thanks for your help.
I'm not sure that they ever really explained that in the instructions. If they did, I missed it.
Level 4 (and later level 16) is a very easy place to collect candy for upgrades early on, not that the game is really so difficult that you would need to grind.
Also, the opposite could be nice. Some posts are labeled NSFW even though they really aren't (e.g. [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/guf1j/administrators_could_you_add_a_feature_that/)).

We had to watch Inception with closed captioning on. We cranked the volume up to a point where it was too loud and we still couldn't hear the dialogue.
