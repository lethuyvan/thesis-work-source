Oh, so you're new to Reddit? 😂
Well, I think if you call it terrible then you'll be downvoted
It should just natively work in game if it's working in Big Picture, but you have to launch the game through Big Picture AFAIK.
How do they build these things?? Nintendo and UPS
Recommended Specs: i9-6840k, GTX 1090 TITAN, 128 GB RAM
Yeah, heat will transact equally on both ways of a reaction if the activation energy is the same. 
Awesome. Where though? MLG Website I'd guess?

I'm buying a Labo I guess.
Looks a little worse than I'd hope, but it performs smoothly.
Nintendo is just garbage at selling things. Really garbage. The Wii U ads were absolutely horrendous, and the eShop as you said takes no steps nor strategies to sell software. You know how every online Nintendo Shops had music? It's there because (and in rl supermarkets) it inclines shoppers to buy things. For some reason, they thought it was a good idea to remove it. Yeah, **REMOVE**; You would have to pull my nuts off if you were to say there was no music to begin with, because trust me, they had the whole development period to make a 16 note jingle, something some dude can literally hum right now and be the final product. They made a concious decision to not add eShop music. The eShop's search functions are also terrible. Try to search up anything but the exact name of the title, and you will get yourself not what you were looking for and 5 of the wrong games. But the most delinquent quality of the eShop is the information. There is nothing you can know about a game on the user end. There is no rating system. There is no comment system. It's like they want to protect the developers feelings. Well, if your game is brick, then you better take it, because you're in the art industry when developing video games.
No one's gonna mention this is the Sticky from Halo?
I can afford it, I just can't bring myself to buy it.

Yeah, because his "shapes" we're "rudimentary" (lacking).
Oh let me win I've been longing to get this game for so long!!! 😶😶😶

Why post it today, let alone on Instagram? I bet those kids don't even know what Opera is.
You sound outlandish, but I think your somewhat right. Zelda in it's history has been a linear cycle: complete a dungeon, get an item, unlock a new place, complete a dungeon, and on. This  Zelda felt so different with the open world, voice acting, breaking weapons, already unlocked tools, with same thing maybe being the theme of Zelda. If you swapped every character, monster, etc. out with a different original character and enemy from a different series, the game shows really no trace of being a Zelda game because everything is extremely new. The dungeons, story, characters (& voice acting), and all other elements are all unique to the Zelda series, so it's still very fresh and doesn't exactly align with the rest of Zelda games. 
Definitely console type of game to be played on a TV.
Highlight of the sub. This is actually a piece of shit but it's so well made.
Nothing here makes sense. The way OP speaks vs. his face & age vs. his username. What world is this.
Can you run? Can you jump?

How do they form geometrical shapes? 
Technically
It so draws out from the game when you're about to die and you have a temptation to just click a button literally touching your finger to survive longer. Also, on FF7 I've accidently healed myself over 10 times.
This is some proof of flat Earth I haven't seen, so honestly this pushed me towards believing so.
Ffffuck no... Ominous as fuck. Caroline shit.

How come
MonkaS You know, KappaPride?
Dunno why your getting downvoted. Pretty interesting
no.
Read the link, it's a new mode where your susceptible to piracy.
Plllll

This is not how I imagined this picture before I clicked it. At all.
They would have definitely called it Smash 4 if it was still 4.
Duh. When I say that it can be surpassed easily, I'm not saying that BOTW is a bad game, I'm just saying they can surpass it much more because really, even for BOTW, they we're being conservative. It's still a 9/10 game in my book, but it's not flawless. 

The dungeons suffer deeply from being pretty fairly and the same theme. The gold textures and the same music, gets kinda old. The puzzles are great, regardless, but you can't go from Zelda which has the coolest themes of dungeons, where in the Wind Waker Dragon Roost volcano, you'd face fire worms and the lizard guys with the swords, and in the Shadow Temple, a hand would come from the ceiling and try to grab you. Now, you just go through these dungeons that have the same enemy, have the same objectives, and the same atmospheres. Only thing varying would be the boss and the puzzles. In every other Zelda game, even though "the master key" was the objective, the real objective lye in the temple. In the Ocarina volcano, you had to bomb the skull's eyes, and in the Twilight Princess Snow place, it was in a frozen mansion with cannonballs as the puzzle mechanic, and eventually reaching the boss. Not just turning some valves throughout the whole time so the water sits right and you can go to Waterblight Ganon.

The side quests don't heavily explore much outside the actual game. Most of them are tasks than a side quest, like retrieving the chickens for the Kakariko village. Or retrieving 1.5M wood pieces to build that village. I wouldn't even consider the memories a real side quest, that I feel is more part of the quest itself. When I reached Yuga clan hideout, I was super excited because I thought I just stumbled upon it and I was really in what BotW was about, but was saddened that it actually was a main plot point in the story.

Shrines- oh don't kill me but- they are just so mundane. The puzzles are absolutely fantastic, I love doing the puzzles. But the atmosphere of the shrines: the repeated blue, orange and grey scheme with the ominous music, get super boring, ESPECIALLY after 120 of them.  After that, you watch the cutscene for the 39th time, and get an orb you need 4 to acquire a heart or stamina piece (regardless, I like how you use to orbs to get hearts and stamina, just not the way you get them.

"Damn, this guy hates this game" Not at all. The dungeons, yes, I hate them. But the exploration part of the game is what makes BotW revolutionary in this day in age. I love how when you start the game, it's super blunt. "Go save the world." Ok. I wasn't even looking at my map when I first ran into Zora's Domain, I saw the Opera theater shell backdrop and was amazed by it and walked towards it, where then Prince Sidon just appeared out of nowhere. It was dope. I remember finding the mountain with the huge creature on it, and it was designed perfectly. It didn't seem like anything was on the mountain, but as soon as you turn to the other side, a huge eye and purple goop just slothered on it. It was absolutely crazy when I saw the glistening on the snow mountain, and went towards it, where I encountered a white horse with Max stats. It was amazing. The four corners of the world were fantastic as well. Climbing the hell that is Eldin volcano, finding Gerudo village and discovering the cool culture was engrossing. 
Great answer to the question.

Didn't you have to win 12 games to get into GC rewards?
I believe there is a massive jump from consistent Diamond to consistent Champ, is when knowing truly when to boost jump. I took me months to stay in Champ (I would just fluctuate in and out,) but eventually once I learned to never have to hesitate nor making a second thought, I was able to play in Champion consistly.

They're just saying this to hype it up w/o any content, of course you want to broaden platforms
Tomorrow Corporation games sell like Hotcakes, and their games are absolutely perfect for Switch.
How in the world can it just turn a ball that fast.
Oh, then try just running only x360ce and find out how do disable it on steam.
Take it off x360ce if you can, rather have it worked simply by playing the game than having an external program.
Please for the love of God
We did, they said this same sentence in an article.
Fiesta Flame, is that very new or very old, because I have never heard of that in my life.
Steam has been natively supporting controllers, so there's a huge chance your controllers being natively recognized, then made into another device by x360ce, making them two. 
It's a third party kind of thing, so I doubt it greatly. Things like mods in Fallout and GTA on console make sense because after their hype died down, mods kept the games extremely lively, so that consitute mods be available for console.
Personally, to rank up, I had to experiment every time, I never really improved by just playing and playing. I see Plat 1 as your just mechanically sound with the fundamentals of the game, so I guess now is the time you need to take risks to learn new things about the game. I didn't start aerialing till I was about Diamond 2, where simply I was finding my self on the ground while they just consistently kept it in the air. I boost jump before, but at Diamond 2 I started doing it when the ball was midfield or to score goals. 
Xenoblade, especially the new one, isn't for everyone. 
I don't get it. Why would you use a graphics card for mining when you can use a CPU or RAM to mine instead? Those sound way better at mining than a GPU.
Yeah that just popped in my head.

Overcooked. With friends it is absolutely frantic, and finding a way to optimize the kitchen is like a puzzle.
Agreeing, and the fact that back in a day, like 1980s, games had a hard time including storage for tutorials, or putting a lot of text on screen, when instead you could just put it in a book that came with a game, and can have as many pages as you need.
Everytime this gets posted everyone just complains. If you don't like it don't watch it, the top comments always complaining of the event. Goodness.

My favourite video game: Shenmue

Even from a very small age, I was able to take a taste of of genuine Asian culture that couldn't be well expressed in the hyperbolic and sometimes ludacris media of anime. The theme of dedication and a journey was set from the start, and on the way embraced the many aspects of small town life in Japan. I learned about martial arts, the type of people, their culture, and a  hometown that held a huge story to tell about itself through gameplay and atmosphere, where people lived by day to day schedules you could adapt to, or just the money laundering scheme happening at the [local airline business.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bLHhl1khTEc) Everyone you talked to was so genuine, so realistic, always had something to learn and love (or hate) about them, nothing quite like it considering it was barely 2000. I wish I could go back to the time where I first played it- it's quite possibly the most immersive and honest game I have ever played.

Based on the whole building and cooperative play, I feel this can grab a boost from Fortnite's current popularity. The whole building, 3rd person, and even zombie aspect are similar, and could prove positive for MGS:S if they let the community know what kind of game it is.
God damnit. I know everyone's butthurt about Kojima leaving, but the game doesn't look bad at all. What if it's good? It looks promising.

Same issue.
My head. Once I saw the illusion though, I can't see what I was seeing.
The presentation was great. The way the menu was like slapped in your face, with all the cool text was great. It made everything feel important. You know in a JRPG there's menus for these weird things you never heard of, like "relics," or "trinkets." Sometimes these are just confusing until you get far in the game when you realize how these things work. Personas Menus make everything seem important with it's art style.
Animal Crossing New Leaf. IMO best game for girls. Not saying it's a girly game, I am sure guys play it more, but it is a fact that girls chew that shit up.

You're not wrong. Champ 1 I was facing D3 and C1 which is great, but once I got into C2, nothing makes sense anymore. Probably because the skill gap between C2 and C3/GC is crazy.

To be honest I don't feel much a difference from D3 to Champ 1. I really do feel a difference from D2 to Champ 1- everyone is just inconsistent coming from D2.
Kinda what I'm saying. Like it isn't very important for the general gamer. Redditers tend to be more curious and hardcore, so I'd guess that's why we are concerned over nonspecific patch notes.
Im pretty sure they just won't want to be crazy about it. 

* Goblin head hitbox reduced from 19 to 18.6
* Shield durability bug causing Shields to break a millisecond faster in Elder Volcano fixed
* Miphana model updated to have more dots on hair 

You know, or they can just say Improvements, because these aren't terribly worthwhile noting, and it gives people just a gist of why their game is updating. 


Nintendo with the great clarifying patch notes.

What your saying is true but besides the point.
While something like Smash Bros. isn't exactly 100% physics, I love watching it since most of the things aren't garunteed, unlike most fighting games. It really depends on how and where you hit your opponent to string another attack. 
Snow Kingdom wasn't that great imo. I loved the population, they were really awesome and unique, reminding me of those people from Twilight Princess- but you really didn't need to interact with them other than the race. After that I forgot about them. But the surface of Snow Kingdom really was just boring to me. I liked the Cloud enemies, they intimidate me at first, but in reality they aren't really that cool. They make ridiculously slow, the blow mechanic takes some time, and is only used to move blocks and that one time kill all those enemies. The water freezing and killing you was just annoying, and the map was just so small. In comparison to something even as small as Lost Kingdom, it was tiny.

Someone please try to connect the DS4 to the switch!!
I don't understand this technique. How do you "join anothers party?" I just don't get it!
Try to not drive backwards. Imagine in any sport, walking or running backwards is just inefficient, unless you have a lot of time and your just chilling in your zone. Of course, if the ball is behind you about to roll into the goal, drive back or backflip. Otherwise try not to, only when necessary. 
I mean like their drive.
Confirmed not
Yup

What is your response to people complaining about supposed input lag?
Good. Gaming isn't capatalism, it's an art. This profit is a reward for them.

Looks alright. When making games, you gotta stand out. Right now that just looks like a mod for MGSV.
yuHH
I can imagine you look like Paul Schneider and are talking to some crazy mom. 
Yeah but he made it sound like L and R smaller bumpers are on the Joy-Con
Bumpers? They are? I know SL and SR are, but the bumpers aren't.
Sports games are their own dimension of gaming. They all are super similar if you think about it. Sliders, cards, story mode, top down view, press the lowest button to pass. 
Personally I love minigolf and don't mind golf, but it didn't have a say whether I liked the game. I'd say 50% of the game is actually golf related, and the other half is story, characters and objectives. The golfing is super satisfying and skillful. 
There's a lot of Yes and No going around, so OP I'd say the safe route is

1. As people said, you can open the Switch up and pack it back up and no one would ever notice. See for yourself if there is a system update. I think there is, since there have been 2-3 system updates since I got it in March. They will all take a total 5 minutes atmost.

2. Invest in the screen protector. Tempered glass goes on super easily, it just sits itself on, no bubbles or striations. In June I scratched the plastic and it's been bugging me for month, wishing I bought a screen protector. And especially if your son is younger, he might be prone to dropping it. 

3. There are extra Joy-Con (those separated controllers you see attached the the switch that you can take off,) and the Pro Controller. Some games can make use of each Joy-Con separately, virtually creating a second controller. Some games don't use it, and require another set of Joy-Cons/Pro Controller. I went fine without another set of Joy-Cons until I bought Mario Kart 8, where we used the other set of Joy-Cons as 1 controller, and the initial set separately for 2 controllers. I'd say you're good until you realize you might want to purchase another set. Other accessories include carrying cases, and I think is important if you ever bring your Switch out of the house. Just makes it safe in bags and is easy to hold.
Can someone answer if the game is hard? My friend owns the game and we have to play so damn sparingly with items and die against bosses and have really hard times against those devilish entities. 
For side quests, ALWAYS CHOOSE QUALITY OVER QUANTITY. No one is going to do your side quest if it's killing 15 zombies, like some quests are in Witcher. Those sidequests aren't fun. However, when you have great sidequests that lead into the story (like Witcher actually does have), I feel compelled to actually delving into side quests. Majora's Mask for example is the golden standard for side quests. Everything contributed to the world around it, and had a great system of rewarding the player, by giving them a mask, a heart piece, or just a general upgrade. 
Based on your profile, I can see you'd be good at parties. 
Unlike ephone... 
I think by weird he meant like too flourished with ideas and lacking a finely paced and fluid game. I still disagree with him- I trust Kojima to make a perfectly tuned game, and Konami didn't have to throttle Kojima's ideas into a video game that's consumable, Kojima understood that himself. 
I'll assume the black guy had a part in the flip?
Thanks.
Thanks
What's the ping now?
What game is this
Nahh nigga I don't watch anime... That shit is kinda weird..

Looks like a 3DS game.

The games out. The negative connotation of preordering comes from if the game is bad, it's unfinished, etc. Hearthstone, the packs are the same as preordering as is just buying it when it's out. I don't know why you'd want to preorder packs, but it's there.
I think that guy made F2P sound super limited. It's not. It's actually huge as hell.  Just once you hit a certain stage in the game does the game feel limited, but otherwise do not worry.
The competition is gonna be so

Yeah no shit it's staged. What else does reddit have to find out; water is indeed wet?
It's as much as the Odyssey trailer, if you get what I'm trying to say. He does say how to get [the good ending] (/spoiler), which isn't anything special at all.
this looks like as if someone who makes up those you won't believe articles for ads on poorer websites wanted to relate to EMSK and made this.

bruh read his comment in full before you get tense of someone clarifying something.
Odyssey is incredibly inspired, but I feel less inspired that Galaxy. Nintendo was on crack for Galaxy and Galaxy 2. I wouldn't doubt there would be atleast DLC. It seems to be a recent trend with Nintendo. (Zelda, MK8, Smash 4, etc.)
Rockstar better not get mad at Nintendo. This game was made 2 gens ago, can't fit on the switch cartridge, and put their company's weaker game first on the switch instead of something like GTA or Red Dead

Yes. I bought one in 2016, and it still is as good as when I first got it. Triggers don't squeek, analog sticks grips are powerful. Great.
Absolutely fucking smart. Blizzard is a great company. Thank God they didn't wait 5 years later, like other game studios which free games at it's honestly death. Get it while it's still warm, SC2 scene isn't even close to death. The subreddit is very active, the pro scene is still powerful.

They don't want the then soon to be standard to be unappealing blank maps- they'd rather have the nice looking and lively maps.
My friend told me this could happen. Basically because of his mixed grip (right hand overhand, left hand underhand), at some point all the weight got onto his left arm, making his bicep take the whole 500 lbs load.
Is it me, or does Rocket League run faster on the Switch than the PS4? My PS4 runs it at around 50, but never a stable 60. The Switch though just handles it.

is it worth returning? I beat the story mode and hard mode.
Please give it longevity. I can't be too excited considering their past mobile games:

I played that Magikarp game, and it really doesn't have much to offer, it plays itself and is ridiculously slow. Worst part is if you know that your Karp is gonna fail the league and you have to sit through the entire fucking shit just to have a new generation. 

Miitomo cannot function. It's not a social media. It's not a game. It's a worthless unfunny madlib. Who gives a shit what ice cream I like? Myself? My ice cream barber? I don't fucking know. Adding friends is like filling out a W-2. No one wants to do it. 

You know what's a good ass game? Pokemon shuffle. It's skill (with a little bit of RNG), and is actually satisfying. Catching Pokemon is satisfying. Getting crazy combos is satisfying. You know what isn't satisfying? Completing a league in Magikarp Ville and going to the next one to do... exactly the same thing. No change of gameplay- actually no gameplay at all. Pokemon Shuffle League is amazing. 9/10.

Fire Emblem was besutiful, fun- however lacked an endgame too (unless you like doing everything x2 in a harder difficulty). Takumi was fucking broken, literally everyone else was obsolete in comparison (other than people strong against melee). The strategy starts to really wear out and it becomes apparent it's a slow rock paper scissors. What I played though was fun, yet again, longevity was missing. 

Super Mario Run. Oh my God. Yes, I know it's affordable now, but that's because of it was so damn expensive and no one played the full game. Even then, the game last 3 hours. Well is it fun? Kinda. Trying to precisely grab every single collectable was fun. But aside from that, the game plays itself, and games that do that are only okay. 



COLOR HEX CODE WILL YOU √π ME?
Ah. Thanks
What does the damage tracker do?
Last time I used Zooper I was able to edit the design and change the clock to 24 hr.
That was so beautiful. Right when he raised the gun, the assailant must've assumed he'd freeze. Instead, the bouncer swung to the right and grabbed ahold of his arm and threw his elbow right into his face, and tackled him down. I don't know much about CQC, but that seemed like the perfect way to handle it.

nice research
When Rocket League comes around, should I get a Pro Controller? It seems better since the buttons are flatter, while the joy con buttons are harder to press down and are smaller.
Doesn't hurt to ask, and hey maybe they know its a known defect and they'd be happy to help.

I see some friends talking to strangers trying to speak at a consistent rate, like they were reading off something, but like the words weren't written and they start "choking." But once they start talking to friends, they are fine and fluent. Give yourself time to think and speak. Sometimes I talk and take like 5 second pauses to just think what I'm going to say midsentence.
I have the same problem, probably not to the same degree, but what I can ask you is this: are you stronger thinking about it, or not thinking about it?

That's absolutely awesome. Games like World of Warcraft have timeless gameplay with in places questionable graphics, but still is awfully addicting. That alone proves you don't need god graphics for your game to be for this day in age.
Ok suppose I saw this on my wall, what should I say to these smart asses?
Funny video, but I think it's too buttered up with post-production. Wally Bear and the No Gang and Clock Tower, for example, had a format of playing the game, then returning back to his good reactions. Flowered with some fingers to point at things, an object he is talking about, or zooming in on things, like how subtle it was that Wally's dad not Uncle had no pants. 

I don't want to force JonTron to adhere an old style that is no longer natural to him now that he has a crew, but instead rebuild but in a different direction from this. Lots of the times it just felt unnecessary, like with the square, the green screening onto the movie, or Pokemon critical shit. However, I do like the real life segments. I think that's a great way to focus budget, but sometimes I feel it is just too much, like with the trumpets, or the hair showcase. Less is more.

I have been thinking about it, and it should've have made some sort of teleportation check points like the eagle statues instead of being able to tele to every shrine. I remember in Twlight Princess and Wind Waker trekking through everything and finding all the islands and small things in between each area, every new enemy, every new threat, but BoTW made too fast paced compared. Once you've explored an area (which was gorgeous and magical), it was littered with shrines and towers, nothing was left. Getting to city and towns we're too easy.

What's wrong with R1 air roll?
just don't boost jump

http://reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/6qodzp/why_im_the_literally_the_worst_rocket_league/dkzhsdz
I feel defense just comes with experience. I don't leave the goal at all until the last second, because there's always a chance I might be juked. There's a point where your opponent has to flick or shoot, not just drive the ball in. It's a sweet spot just found with time. 
Sure, to be clear I'm talking about not jumping in the air and flipping, that's just a power shot, which is great to do. I'm talking about being in the air to the point you can't dodge/flip in any direction. This suits more 2v2s, as 3v3s is much more forgiving, but it is just harder but not impossible to come in contact with the ball.

To better understand this, I like to say until your say Plat 2/you can convincingly make at least 50kmph aerial goals, this is how it is: 

If you leave the ground for an aerial, it's a 1v2 on the ground. If your teammate doesn't aerial like you do, it's even more a 1v2. If you and an opponent are in the air, it's a 1v1 on the ground. If EVERYONE is leaving the ground, yes it is a 2v2 again, but everyone starts soaring near mid plat. 

Why is it a 1v2? I'm hitting the ball. Yes you are, but it always falls. It takes longer for you to fall. So on the ground, it's a 1v2, even if it's still on your possession. You are still in the air, usually midfield 20 feet in the air with no boost and helpless until you touch the ground again. Worst case scenario you and your partner boost jump, because it can cause scenarios where it is 0v2.

I'm not home right now, but I can grab a replay where I played Diamond 2 doubles without crazy boost jumping a couple months ago. Boost jumping is by no means ever necessary if the ball touches the ground. 

In contrast, a grounded shot can be dribbled, easily passed, and easily scored, saves almost all 💯 of your boost and leaves you with about a second of falling before jumping right in the game. You'd rather wait for your opponents to evoke a 1v2 situation. On the ground, it's not hard to turnover a 1v2 situation, you hold forward and press X twice with some boost. 

I'm not home right now, but if your interested I'll show you one of my earlier games in Diamond 2 a couple months ago where I couldn't boost jump aggressively at all. Lots of people said I was boosted, my friend said this looks no different than his gold game, but really it's positioning that takes you bronze to Grand Champion. I hope it makes sense now why even BRONZE has people doing aerials.

tldr: your not as good as aerial as ground shots, your teammates are CERTAINLY unprepared for you doing aerials, and people are in bronze because of aerials.
I understand the it, but it they were kinda at the same starting point, it wasn't obvious the other guy was gonna take it.
Flying yourself is your enemy unless it's Plat-Diamond. People flying against you below that tend to lose. Flying in diamond is just like people flying in bronze but just hit it a little harder and are nearly 100% accurate.
Yeah, don't worry I got it :>
No problem.
Analogies are more for insane plays. Not tryna be mean but the accompanying gif wasn't fitting :p
At those ranks up until plat, just don't boost jump ever. It's tempting but don't. Unless they're about to score high, fine.
He's joking
Wait I've seen you before, I'm sure your joking.
now he knows
Now this is how you contribute.
I mean, without the carrier it's just a handheld computer.

Hey man I'm a bit busy today, sorry I can't make it. I'll add you, we will play in the future.
He look like the friend in highschool you are acquainted with and like you haven't had a class with him in 6 years but when you two are seated next to each other your like supppp mannn 🤜🤛
6 hours earlier of you
Nah I'm saying your 6 hours ahead of me, so if you play at 6pm I'm playing at 12pm. But yeah, I do game at night as well
:P.
I am 6 hours behind you, so 6pm on CET is fine.
CET so that'd be 12PM for me tomorrow. Sure!
What that guy said is correct. 99% of shots ever in Rocket League is because the goal is open, and that happens after 1. a weak aerial 2. a whiff 3. double commit. I can safely tell you now aerials will actually demote you up until Plat 2. Yes, Gold 3 to Plat 1 does make fine aerials, but they aren't 100% consistent with it. It's like tennis, just keep returning the ball, they'll eventually mess up. I started playing again some time ago and reached Plat 2, but as soon as I got comfortable with aerials I started dropped viciously. At Gold 3 I just refrained from aerials. You should still train them, and go for them only in situations where you can score or they will score on you. Aerials in the field are kind of unnecessary when instead you have the time for a grounded powershot.
I'll play with you on PS4 and get you to say gold 2
Ok I did some research on jump, and no I do not. 
I don't have a sick child at bay but my friend had been on edge of buying this and still hasn't. I hope I win!

Hey man, when rocket league comes out, not to boast but I'm Diamond 2. I really want to play with you. Hmu!!!
As long as the controller is easily controllable, there is no difference. Hell, if someone was used to using a Linksys router, then it just comes down to the game.
I kid you not I just stayed at plat 3 div 4 for at least 2 weeks, dropped to div 3 about twice but that's it.

You have to have a good personality to be a damn admin or moderator and at least 50% people don't understand that. The guy went to an admin for his needs to make the game a better environment and instead gets boned by an ignorant admin? Well, I guess I just shouldn't report anyone right? 
good
Damn, how are you doing now?

ELI5 How developers make puzzels like these? Some of them are so tricky and precise, I wonder how the developers have enough mental firepower to generate so many complicated puzzles.
It's a mod, so I doubt they'll be too anxious to throw down a ban hammer.
Well- fuck.
Unrelated, but I like how they use some traditional Japanese melody at the end. I just imagine when Japan makes videos regarding the US, they use the US national anthem, or some slow beat guitar.
sorry for the absolutely shit quality

It's not the player pool, it's the ranks. it's just on PC I rocketed to Diamond and can win 50% of my games. 
I am straight up Diamond 3 on PC but Plat 2 on PS4. I have to entirely switch play styles everytime I switch. On PS4 I sit in goal for powershot opportunity to the other side, but have to act slowly on offense to avoid me getting ahead of the ball, and some of my teammates love to double commit. I can't boost jump passes, because they'll boost jump and possibly miss, leaving us both airborne. Have you ever noticed you winning against people who are just amazing at boost jumps? That's the idea.

Diamond 3 however, I have to boost jump every opportunity I have to gain possession. While I try not to boost jump with my partners, they hit it more controlled and precisely to allow us to land, fight on point or defend upcoming fast breaks.

Thank you so much for the thoughtful reply. I will incorporate this!
Sorry to jack the thread but

how do I do proper aerials? I got to Diamond II with no aerials at all (except for defensive, e.g. tapping the ball away from my goal), but I definitely feel like I have a skill wall where I just cannot come in contact with the ball anymore by just sitting on the ground. When I go for aerials, they always feel so weak, misguided, or whiffed, and then the opponent volleys it back much harder, and I'm 100 ft. in the air while the opponent scores. I dropped from Diamond II to Platinum I trying to incorporate aerials, but eventually I just abandon trying to do it and stuck to the ground. Jumping and committing your car to an aerial leaves your goal with one, or sometimes no defenders. I'd much rather just try to capitalize off my opponents mistakes than go for aerial goals.
I almost deleted rocket league and I am 400 miles away from home

I think it's in part that barely any kids use a computer at a young age without intention. I also remember people showing each other these flash games during school, or at their homes. Another thing is that YouTube exposed more kids to ROBLOX and Minecraft, so they get on their computers and load that up, instead of searching for flash games.

It's just hard to actually get a lead, so you are usually close to your opponents and susceptible to more items. The turns on that map are very tight.

When things like this happen, what kind of break are they given? A day?
Sadly bots are realisticly just for starting out. Some games can have bots that play like humans, but not rocket league where a robot driving a car is much different than a human driving a car.
I'm only diamond three, but I feel the main difference between champ and gc is the sharpest of judgement. I still play champs who barely jump for a ball because they hesitate by a ms everytime. It could mean denying a goal, taking possession, it even scoring.
If you showed me a picture of Metroid, I would have said the same thing. That's why you should just play it.
What happens to them? Do they upscale? Honestly that is a huge turn off.
Uh, LEDONGDESTROYER isn't enough for you?
I believe it depends on a game. For a solely single player game, like Fallout 4, it has some age. For a solely multiplayer game, say RL, it's a baby.

Oh sorry! I can see your opinion well. A better way to say it is like more complicated than the top.

The color and the pattern of the wheels have a "complexity" to them, in contrast to the "simplistic" body design.
Damn. I love the solid blues and the complex wheels.

Thank God. I haven't played a linear adventure in so long. It feels good, because you don't feel obligated to conquering every single side quest or find loot in every nook and cranny. 
I can't access this for some reason. Can someone tell me why?
I'm afraid games will just stop selling as well as they would on the 3DS in 2019, and they will actually wait for developers to pull the plugs instead of them. You have all the reasons to own a Switch by 2019, the E3 lineup and other unknown upcoming games are absolutely ridiculous.

You know what forget it, I just realized it wasn't a joke at all. It's more of a statement. I don't think it weakens the joke, but doesn't amplify it either. 
Yeah but, "that's some value," and "mayor of value town" are two completely separate jokes. One quoted him, and one is his own joke.
