At least it’s better than X/Os rendering certain other systems use. Barf!
That’s good to hear. Thanks. 
Is it a solid 30 FPS?

That’s good to hear. I heard GOW’s frame rate was not great at the higher resolution. 
Oh man I loved the ps2!! 

I skipped school to buy it on launch day. Somehow my parents let me. I got Timesplitters,  smugglers run & silent scope. I was literally shaking while opening it. 

What I would give to have a remake of timesplitters 2!!

Also red faction was amazing. They released it on PSN and it’s just as fun as the day it came out. My buddy and I spent hours blowing deep deep holes in the maps. 

Those were the good only days of gaming. 
I use it to take the skirt and priming bead off the bed usually. Then I don’t have to touch the PEI with my fingers. 
That’s good to hear. Damn now I may have to think about upgrading to the pro again. 
Wow this is awesome
How is the frame rate in 4K mode? I read it has issues keeping it at 30. I really want to upgrade to a pro but have read mixed things. 
I need on that will automatically shut off if it gets too hot. Randomly my shower will blast boiling hot water at you. It’s a great surprise!
Unreal
Good point
Thank you kind sir
I think he meant the filament cost. 

But the STL was, I think, $15
That would have been awesome. But he still has to rip open his shirt at the end. Bruce shows him the suit. Next scene is him ripping his shirt open. 
I really wish they had done bearded Superman in the black suit in Justice League.

Ya I was quite surprised too
Thanks
Thanks
Hope
I think it was around $5 in PLA filament. 

Edit: The 3D file was $15

Very cool
How does GOW run on the pro?

I was thinking of upgrading to the pro so I can have 4K games on my projector, but I have heard mixed things about 4K mode on GOW. The frame rate can’t keep a solid 30fps in 4K is what I’ve read, But it can keep a solid 60fps in 1080p mode. 
Ya it was hard to justify but hard to convince the wife. Lol. I like that you matted out the emblem. Well done 
Nice job and truck!

I have the same truck but 2013. I added the TRD PRO 2015 grill. It’s awesome!

I plasti dipped my rims. They have lasted two years with out needing any retouches. Which surprised me. I expected only a few months. I even painted the lug nuts and they have lasted a few tire rotations. Blew my mind!  


I had to order it. I call at 11am and they had it ready for 1pm. They called me back an hour later to double check i that I wanted it to say “happy birthday superman” they were very confused. Lol

My staff loved it, mainly because they love any kind of cake. Lol
Dairy Queen ice cream cake. 
Lol. I ordered the cake. But they will always take any opportunity to have cake. 
Ah! I just started using it a year ago.
Lol. It printed great! The lamp still stands
Cool!
I find the Hatchbox fits fine.  it’s amz3D clear I’m currently using. 
Oh shit!!!!!
Did you make this? It’s awesome. I will have to print it
Regular white. It seems to be running fine. Not actually sure if there is a clog. 
White
I used the Mono PriceSelect Mini. The MK3 is amazing! The auto mesh bed levelling, filament sensor and crash detection. It really take a lot of the set up and pre work out of printing. 

Between every print on my MPSM I would have to level the bed using four screws. It was painful. 
This was the first motogp I have every watched and it definitely got me hooked. Same with a few people I invited over. None of them had seen it and this one was awesome for them too. 
Did you print the smaller one? I have the MPSM but couldn’t get it to fit
For the stones I 3D printed a stone stencil and just painted with it. 
That one looks awesome. Finish it!!!!
I’m no expert and am just learning myself. Get a few decent brushes of different sizes and good quality paint. I use Vallejo paints as I read they were one the of best. 

One of the best tips I learnt was water down black paint 50/50 or buy black wash and randomly brush it in all the cracks and such. Then wipe it off with a paper towel. Makes things look awesome. Just go nuts with it. 

I find also when painting watch the tip of the brush and how it is shaped. You can really control it if you just watch how each tip works. It make painting straight lines and small parts much easier.

This is amazing. 
I had some ass hat pass me using the exit ramp lane. Just so he could sit in traffic 5 seconds later. At that point I was excited for all the traffic. 
He recorded the answers to the test and had them put on vinyl. Then printed fake labels so they would look like popular albums. Boom!
I loved this set. 
Nope some people will just complain over nothing. Maybe they don’t know how to correctly use the printer, maybe they didn’t take the time to learn about 3D Printing. It requires some research and time. There are many different settings and materials.
Its not a question of does it need it... It’s only a question when. Which the correct answer is right away. 
Awesome thanks
Personally, I think it’s worth it. It’s has the dual RGB color wheels and better black levels. 

The refresh rate is a little worse for gaming on the 65. But I have been playing games on it for a few months and they look great!  No issues. Maybe an online twitch shooter like COD may lag a tag. Not 100% sure. 

4K HDR content looks epic! Planet Earth 2 will melt your eyes. 

If your room is not pitch black the 60 is a little brighter. 

But if your primary use is a light controlled movie room get the 65. You won’t regret it. 

Here is a good comparison video

https://youtu.be/xygKdWjqBDs
Get a good screen. I got the UHD65 and a 120” elunevision screen. It looks amazing!! So crisp and clear. Don’t waste you money on a sub par screen with 4K.  
Ocean horn was amazing. Haven’t really played a full game since that one. 
I said no new games in 2018. Bought scythe and all it expansions in Jan. Lol
I don’t own it. But it seems like a pretty cool hame. Might have to pick it up
Ya we decided as a group to roll a dice. If we get s 7 or 8 then we draw from the travel deck. We just found it too hard and less fun every time. 
It plays great. I got the game and played it all the time. Sometimes twice in a night. Then we kinda forgot about it for a while and it was just as fun to pick it up and Play it. Very easy to remember. 
Score!
Michael’s Arts Store. Lol. We made a rule if you beat the dragon you get to tame it and then ride it for the rest of the game. The characters fit perfectly on it. That then allows you to move to and from and quest for free. 
Scythe. 
I just can’t get into this show. Damn it. 
Nice truck!
My buddy and I both have had no issues with our MK3 parts. Some parts were tight but it wasn’t an issue.  

If you have a problem contact support I’m sure they will send you replacements. 

Remember they are not a multimillion dollar printer company. It’s amazing a small sized company can produce so many quality printers. There are bound to be a few parts that aren’t perfect. But overall they are doing an amazing job. Love my mk3. 
Sweet I’ll give it a try. Thanks. 
Thanks. It’s works most of the time and usually just restating the pi and printer fixes the problem. I may have to give re imaging a try if it gets any worse.
Micro machines were the best
Ah that makes sense. When did the s come out?
Amazing! I’d love to get the bigger version of the cr10. 
Right, but I guess if your deciding between them they are both still 3D printers. Just depends on what you want to do and what you want to spend. 
Prusa i3 Mk3 in Gray Hatchbox PLA
I use Cura because I have used it for a year on my last printer. I tried Slic3r PE but didn’t like it not having undo and also not warning you if you are out of the build area. 
I just got the mk3 and the quality is amazing. The layer lines are damn near perfect. And I get first layer porn almost every print.

IMO (from watching reviews of both printers) the CR10 is great at printing big things and overall a really great printer. But it can’t get as nice of print as the i3 mk3. Plus the mk3 has so many amazing automated features.

I was torn as well with which one to get. Mk3 or cr10. I think in the end you’ll be happy with either. But my vote goes towards Mk3

I actually printed a different STL. It was a pain in the ass as it fell over twice. Finally got it to print with a better raft

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1844752
https://i.imgur.com/NVyiph0.jpg

After I finished I found this edited version and it seemed much easier. 
That’s fair. I wanted to print it two parts to make it huge! 

The one I actually printed is this one. It fell over twice. But I beefed up the raft and it worked the third time. Lol

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1844752

But after I found this newer version that you could print with the back the other way.  Seems much easier.

Yes. I listen to only a hand full of bands. Can’t stand much else. So Apple Music does not appeal to me. But it’s now become such a big part of the music app. I just want to have my few bands and play them on repeat shuffle. I also have disabled as much as I can but it always finds a way to remind me about Apple

My biggest two gripes with Slic3r is no UNDO and there is no warning to say your object is outside the print bed. 
Oh good to know. Thanks. 
Yes!! Thank you:)

I assume I can use the slack app on iPhone and get the messages from that?
I’m printing it with Hatchbox white PLA. 

I am back to using cura with great results, after tweeting some stuff. Probably more l could tweak but the prints are coming out nicely. 

I tried Slic3r PE but was so use to cura, from my last printer, I just couldn’t bring myself to stick with Slic3r. Plus cura connects directly to octoPrint and you can send prints right to the printer wirelessly with one button click. So satisfying!! 😆 




Nice! I want to print this. 

I’m currently printing a large LEGO skeleton. 24 hour print on my mk3! Such an awesome printer. 
Add Octoprint and the pi camera. It’s amazing. 

I noticed yesterday the lettering on the head says HOT!2. I wonder why!?!


Damn smart idea
Sweet thanks. Was wondering how this would work. Makes sense now. 
I had no idea. Glad this was posted. 
Seems like a weird thing to not have. I guess you just have to keep checking the objects height.

Thanks for the help 🍻 
Can you see the print from the side in 2D view. If I put it in 2D mode. And go to view > side (or any other view option) the view doesn’t change. It stays as a 2D top view. 
Fresh Prints of Bel Air!!!!!!!!!
That’s fair. Point taken. I down voted myself. 
Open world but you only get ⅓. The other ⅔ will be DLC. 
I think I’d care more if it was a young Jor-El as the main character maybe.
It does but it’s hard to tell where the z axis ends. And if you have a part overhanging higher up it’s hard to tell if it’s in the print area. 
I just couldn’t get into it. It was a run of the mill
Sci-fi show with Superman elements slapped on it. I could care less about the characters. Just because they had an S on their clothing doesn’t make me care. 

And the whole cape hour glass this was so effing lame. 

I really liked the design of the emblem and brainiac was pretty cool. But I don’t think I’ll watch another episode. 
Mine shipped and it never said it shipped. It said packing even while
It was shipping. I somehow find a tracking number and I could see that it had shipped. 
One of my favourite Superman animated series. They remaster them a while back and they look and sound great for something made in the 40s
I got it for $80 CAD which is $61 US
It’s a really nice statue. 
I ordered mine Feb 3rd. It’s arriving today
I’m in Week 5 bought Feb 3rd and I should be getting it today. March 22th
I paid $85 for import fees and duty. 
It’s basically a run of the mill sci-fi show with Superman slapped on it. It has no characters that I personally give a shit about. Except brainiac. 

[SPOILER]

The whole dude coming back in time is lazy.

And Superman’s cape is a hour glass and when it’s fully dissolved superman won’t exist anymore. Give me a break. That’s some poor writing right there.  


Just give us a real superman show. For fucks sake. 
They should have just made red kryptonite and have the main villain brainiac. That would have been great.  I do kinda like Superman 3. 
I have this one and it’s awesome. Clasp works fine and has some decent weight to it.

Sweet, finally something to lock in my foot odour. 
Can you have it synced to Apple calendar?
Pic?

Ya I got fired. Plus I banged the guys daughter while drinking a coke a cola 
And? So your saying it should do this. I don’t understand.
Really dude! Just take a step back and look at the what your staYing. Everything adds up. A little thing here a little thing there. It is a problem. IOS is still great but lacks the overall polish it once had.
This is true. While Apple still does a lot right. There are many small things they just dropped the ball on. 
I run 15 windows 10 machines at my office. I can tell you they are not better than OS X. But They are better than Windows 8.
While it’s not a big deal of a bug it is kind how iOS 11 runs now. So at least it’s not false advertising. Lol


For this to make it in to a polished ad seen by many people involved in the production is pretty crazy. 

I have sat in a room with Coke a Cola executives who argue about the colour of the red used in a commercial for hours.
Tiny galaxy and tiny kingdom

The rules are too complicated for such small games. We start to play and just end of playing something g else. 
Lol nope. Unless eating burgers and beer is working out. 

I didn’t really want one at first. Didn’t really see the need. So I skipped the 1 and 2. But they announced the 3 and I thought it would be worth a try. Figured they have the design down by now. 

I Haven’t looked back. I got a metal link band off amazon for $35 and I wear the thing every day. It integrates very well with my iPhone and Mac. Very seamless.
Wear it everyday. Had it for 8 months. 
Oh! they are putting it into the shrinking machine in this photo. 
Haha. There was just a post about doing this too. 
$35, portable, 3d printed a case and runs fine for me. I had a few emulators on my PC but never played them. This thing I take many places. Even bought a PICO projector for it. 

You could build a portable system, or a home console. You can even build one into a controller. 

I don’t see how someone couldn’t like this. But to each their own. 
Just use the rectangle shape with fill. It’s under the + menu. 
~~How do we know what week we are in? I ordered mine on Feb 4th. Assembled~~

I think I’m Week 5. Which I guess means mine with ship around March 19th?

So excited to get mine. I’m glad they are not rushing them out the door.
That’s fair
This ad has been here for years. Clearly it’s not working for them as there is not an actual ad. 
It’s been there for a few years. 
If it’s so effective why isn’t their a real ad there?
You can probably find it at a junk store or the budget bin at GameStop

Replace the power supply with an Xbox 360 one. It will be way more reliable. Use a web camera, and a wifi shit off plug. And have a fire detector in the same room.
3 owners and 2 accidents, personally I would skip. Reported accidents are usually cause bigger issues. 
Loved this store. I don’t think we had it in Canada so every time we went to myrtle beach my parent would take me. 

I remember getting these tanks that opened up into playsets with mini tanks. It was amazing!!
I’ll let you know when I get mine. 🤞 this month. 
Thanks:)
Thanks :)
Yes it does
What?
Easy to use, handoff between devices, secure and safe, doesn’t come with a bunch of bloatware, snappy, updates are easy to install, App Store, imessage, FaceTime. 

It’s not the best, but it’s better than the rest. Which I guess makes it the best. Lol. Whatever!
I loved these. Still have the Superman one. 
Ha
Haha!!! 
Lol. Sweet I can start paying this off. 
Thank you 
Thanks :)
Thanks :)
It seems easy. I have only used it once. I think you just put some water in the kettle and let it boil for 4 mins. Then empty and wipe clean. I also have some cleaning solution that came with it. I assume you just put it in while it boils the water. 
Thanks ;)
Haha. I have black ones to wire in, But I never find the time to do it. Lol. I think I hate doing it.

Correct!! Don’t get why people don’t understand this. 
What I’m saying is why make cheap phones that will see more but make less money, when they can sell a high end phone that has a huge profit margin and charge 10x that of the cheap phone. 
Sell one phone for $1000 or 10 phones for $100. 
Make 1/10 less product but still make the same mula. 
Sell one phone for $1000 or 10 phones for $100. 
They can easily sell 1/10 the phones of the low end guys and still make the same. Plus less is needed to make 1/10 the phones. 


Apple branded themselves as a high end electronics company. It’s about image really. If you sell discounted or low end products than that’s what your clients know you for. 

It’s the same reason why Brinks doesn’t sell cheap jewelry.
I’d rather they not rush the printers out the door.  Take the proper time to build and test them. 
Very nice
Wow 256megs of ram. Crazy!

I think the cut scene thing was confusing us. Thanks. I’ll give it a try. 
If this was gold and black I would buy this immediately. Not really digging the silver and gold together. But it’s kinda cool
The 60 has a better refresh rate for gaming. I use my ps4 on the 65 and it so far seems fine. Been playing Monster hunter recently and it looks great. I’m told, COD or battlefield would not be perfect though. But have yet to test a game like that. 
Here is a video I made a while back on how to set a gif as a back ground. . Hope it helps anyone who is still confused.

I think I did a factory reset once since I started with the 3GS. It was when I got my iPhone 6s Plus. I felt like just starting with a new phone instead of a restore. Not because of an issue but felt it would be fun to start over.  Lol

I used the same back up from 3GS - 4 - 4s -5 -5s - 6. And now I have the same back up from the 6s Plus to my current X. 

Oh man these were the best. The dragon island was so sweet. And the skull set. 
The toys were the best. 
Been there before. Some people are just fuckwads. I would have just trolled him back. Make a game out of it for yourself. Or punch him in the face. Either one would work. 
Yup no regrets 
It’s a pain in my ass. If zone2 gets mistakenly turned on my harmony hub won’t turn it off. And it also sometimes starts to play music very loud. I will never need it as it’s in my movie theatre room and does not have speakers elsewhere.

Noooooo I just bought this last week for full price
Lol
It working great. Pretty easy to configure. Found a YouTube video with the commands to make it act as a controller and not a keyboard.

Yeah, right 


I want to see this in SPACE!!
Oh I totally forgot it was missing. Guess I didn’t miss it either. 
Cool. Looks great
Awesome thanks
What did you use to paint it?
I’m sure it does not. It’s a tap not a buzzzz. Buzzz is so 1990. 
I forgot war even existed. I deleted it after I gave it a few chances. It sounds like a punk kid skateboarding song. I would need to buy skate shoes and wear a flat brim hat, with the sticker still on, to the side. 
Correct I choose not to. 
First time I listened to muse was just before they released The 2nd Law. I was at my buddies house and he played it while we did some renovations. I didn’t care for it much. 

Then a few months later he offered me a ticket to their show.  I said “nah not really into them”

At some point shortly after, I decided I would give them another try. I put on their new album The 2nd Law and my head exploded!!! It was the greatest thing I had ever heard. 

Always regretted not going to that 2nd Law concert. But I did get to see them last year. Best concert I have ever been too. 

Now they are my favourite band only tied with Linkin Park. 
You can bribe, make secret deals and trade coins with others. Other wise you are just expanding and growing your empire. I guess fighting with others is interacting. But that’s a very small part of the game.

Unless you ha e the faction that can put more than on victory star in a slot. Then I guess you could just battle the whole time. That could be fun. 
Scythe is awesome. Might be my favourite game of all time. This one is not that complex. Just watch an explanation video. Once you get the rules, it’s great. It seems complex but it’s not.

If everyone has played the game before, or maybe watched the video;  it’s about 30mins per players. So a 4 player game could be 2 hours. 

4-5 is a good number, I think. 

I played with 2 and it was a little easy. But still lots of fun. 

I have the expansion that adds 2 more player for a Total of 7. It would be a hard game. Everyone would need the afternoon free and should probably have played it a few times. 

Get the bigger board add on, the metal coins and realistic tokens. They are fantastic. 
Samsung makes great parts and phones. That’s not the issue here. Find me a Samsung phone that can run IOS then?

Regardless of who makes the parts, Apple still makes the software. Being able to design the software to work with specific hardware is always the best route to go. 

It’s kinda like buying furniture for your new house. But you have no idea the true layout or size of the house. Do you buy small furniture or big furniture. Can you fit a love seat and a full size couch? Coffee table? 12 seat dinning room table or just a table for two? King size bed or twin?

The answer is you buy the smallest of everything and it’s guaranteed to fit.
STL?
The UI is nice and yes I could totally download something similar. But honestly having an OS designed for the hardware it will run on just makes sense to me. 

Also, It’s the integration with my AppleWatch and Mac that is amazing. Handoff is awesome. Being able to start an email on my phone, then sit down at my Mac, which unlocks automatically with my Apple Watch, and up comes the email I was just working on ready to continue on my Mac. It’s a very surreal feeling. Sometimes I just do it for fun. Lol

 You can probably do this on other phones but this just works out of the box. It’s one button click to enable it. 

Plus the App Store has some amazing apps. 
But they are much much smaller. So unless you want a huge modular phone. It’s kinda difficult. 

To the general public building a PC is rocket science.  Most people can’t even understand what RAM is. They think the PC include is a CPU. This why there a so many options for pre built computers. More people want a fully built computer. Which is why people love macs so much. They do t good be two shits if you can add more RAM because they don’t even know what it is. 

This is the same reason why a build your own phone is not a great business plan. Nobody wants to do it, except the few. 

I myself loved building computers. But now I have a kid and a full time job. I don’t have any interest in taking the time to build one again. Maybe one day with my kid IDK. 

Except, I do make time to 3d print stuff. now that’s fun. Let me 3d a fully working phone. Now we’re talking!!
Glad I could help :)
It’s under the initial layer speed setting. It gives the filament time to stick to the bed. 

I think you can even say how many layers you want do at the slow speed. I started with 2 slow layers. But now just do one, once I know the bed is level. 

Once you have your bed levelled.

Start the print and during the first part of the brim use your Allen key and lightly tap the print from the side. [photo (sorry it's hard to see as the PLA is clear)](http://i.imgur.com/smdl8Sz.jpg) 

If it comes off on one or more of the sides, raise that part of the bed a small amount while it’s printing. After it does another pass check it again. I have found this to help a lot with bed adhesion.

Good luck and keep printing. 



Just study electronic engineering in school for 8 years. Specializing in telecommunications. Then work for years as a test technician. Work your way up the ladder into the engineering department and boom you can make your own phone. 
Looks like a pretty solid phone and a good price too. Only issue for me is I actually enjoy ios. So I guess I have to pay the extra $280 for it. 
IMO I find just for the first layer running it slow always works better. It will speed up after the first layer. 
Raise that side a bit, put some glue stick down and start with a slow 15mm/s 3-6mm brim. 

Your initial layer speed may be too high. Try 15mm/s
Thanks! Now I have to find these comics.

The portrait mode on the iPhone X is amazing. In the right lighting it’s very comparable to a DSLR. The top phones from most companies seem to preform similar but the portrait mode on X takes the cake. 

It will never replace a DSLR but it will a good option when you don’t have your DSLR.

Yes. SD cards are easier to handle and sometimes cheaper. Also the micro sd port can break pretty easily. 
Use an SD card. Don’t waste time and energy on wifi or USB printing. 

Get a micro sd card to SD card adaptor, print the replacement size and you’ll be set to go. It’s like $5 for the cable adaptor.

The online match making sucks. I am not great at games but I always get put with people who spend their life playing games. I spawn, die, repeat. After a few days it just gets annoying. Until they actually place you in a match with people your own skill level I’m Staying the fuck away. 
What if it’s the queen of England on the phone?
Lol. It had a crack in the tailgate when I bought it, 2 years ago. 

I filled the crack with bon-do over the this summer, but it seems that whatever I did made it much much worse; as it cracked even more and a chunk fell off. :( 
Usually a knife can fix a swelling battery. The battery needs a few air holes to breath.

WELL DONE!
Repetitiveness is a big one for me. If I see the same assets used over and over or missions that are just copies of the last mission. 

Also Repetitiveness is annoying. 

Poor matchmaking is also a big one. This is why I don’t bother with COD anymore. I suck at the game but it keeps putting me with people who play the game as if it’s their life. Spawn walk a few feet die, spawn walk a few feet die. It gets very.... repetitive... whoa 😮. 

Also Repetitiveness.

I hadn’t planned on getting it for a while anyway, but decided what the hell I’ll order it now. My MPSM will keep me happy until it arrives. 

Thanks. I did end up buying it. 
I 3d printed [this](https://i.imgur.com/Nla4y6h.jpg) and it works awesome. Easy to take out and very strong. 

If you go to your local library sometimes they have a 3d printer you can use for free. You just pay for materials. Which is pennies for this print.

I do now
I have scythe and love it. Have so far played- two 5 player games, one 3 player game and a 2 player game. 

Everyone I have played with seems to really enjoy the mechanics of it. The player board is awesome. The mechs looks pretty cool; especially for you give them a quick paint. 

Personally I feel It’s pretty easy to make a strategy and actually do it. A lot of games I play I get lost in the turns and never really know what to do next. With scythe I feel like I have a plan. Okay I’m going to do this, this and this. And if that doesn’t work then I’ll do this as my back up and boom I’ll win. Not that I always win the game but I feel like I have a good chance to win. 
Oh man that’s a nice colour
I have never actually tried to get a trophy in a game. Sometimes I get them randomly and think oh wow I wonder why I got that.
It’s okay. The competition part of it has been removed. It’s okay if you have to play play it and only have two people. But other than that is not great. Just okay
And he’ll probably only be in the last 5 mins of the movie. But be used on the box art and trailer.

Haha. I didn’t even notice that it “corrected” It. Thank you auto correct. Always there when I need you most.

The new tundras seem to have them a lot. And the new Tacoma’s too. I’m sure there are a few other 2nd gens in Canada with them too. Lol but I like to think I’m the only one. 
Odd. Try playing with its length or where the key frame is. 
Damn lucky! 

It never came to Canada as it was only available in the US. So I feel as a Canadian I have the only one in Canada 🇨🇦 Lol. Also $600 CAD is about $470US. So $500US is about what I paid. 
Nope. It will always stop

Did you add a repeat at all? 

I just tried it and got it to work with no repeats. 

But when I tired 2 times repeat it did not work. It just shows a frame or two. 
Once you have converted the gif to a live photo. 

Go back into the Photos app. And find the newly saved LivePhoto. 

Click the edit button and you can then move the key frame at the bottom. Slide the bar over to the last frame and set it as the key frame. 

I can post another video using screen capture, just showing that if needed. But it’s also in the original video. 
Not at all. Best iPhone yet. 
~~How did you do this my world clock is empty. I can add a city but can’t figure out how to change its name. I feel like this is really easy and I’m just an idiot~~

1) Find and save a gif to Photos app

2) Open intoLive and import the gif

3) Convert gif to a live photo and save to “Photo” app. If you pay the $3 you can have it repeat a few times if the gif is really short. (But don’t make it too long or it won’t work)

4) go to the newly created live photo in Photos app and click EDIT. 

5) —>[VERY IMPORTANT] <— 
Now choose the last frame of the live photo and click “make key frame” (if you don’t do this it will just be black)

6)Now create a  photo watch face with this live photo. 

Done. 

If you are getting a black screen or a non moving background make sure you set your key frame as the last frame.

Depending on the length of the gif you may want to add the repeat. If the gif is short then the 2x or 3x makes it longer and thus looks cooler. 

But if it’s too long then it won’t work at all. There is a small window of it working and not I have noticed. I have not tested the supported max length of a gif. Maybe today I’ll do that. 

Edit: added gif length part and link to app




Thank you kind sir

Been really happy with it. No issues and it looks and fits awesome. 
JL while not perfect but it was much much better than BvS
Yes. It could have been such a great film. There was just so much wrong with it. I find it hard to sit down and watch the whole thing anymore. 
When!!!
It was an amazing game for 6 months Beth’s. Then it just became repetitive 
Agreed
Was looking at this. I would build the catamaran. Is it worth it?
Cool thanks
Same. 😩

I think they are back on track now. But I’m not sure where I heard that or if I just convinced myself of it. Lol
When I placed my order there was a breakdown of shipping estimates for dates purchased. 

I bought mine on Feb 3. Which shows March 12. I also asked via the chat on their website. 
Ya mine says March 12. But I’m telling myself end of March. 
Ummm maybe he could open it up and put new ones it. It is LEGO ya know. 

Also I pretty sure those will glow for many many years.
They should have had him just wear the damn black suit. We all wanted it!! 

I get a lot of people hated JL on here. And it was doomed to fail. But IMO Justice League was a good movie. 

I don’t like zach’s work. He does not understand store flow or character progression. All he can do is make a fight scene that goes on and on forever.

MOS was good for what it was. If you cut out 40 mins of fighting it’s much much better. 

BvS was a train wreck!  The theatre version was missing half of the story. And the extended edition. Had the full story but was too fucken long. Doomsday should not have been tacked on the end. By the time it got to that part, people were already annoyed by the poor writing and pointless BvS scene. 

JL was much better and shorter. It had a good mix of joy, a decent story, some laughter and Superman actually like being Superman. Yes the moustache thing was a disaster. They need to fix that shot before they release it again. 

But that’s just my opinion. 
End of March can’t come soon enough!!!! Can’t wait to get my Mk3
Nope. Just shower and clean the watch
Thanks for this
All the time. I just give the watch a good wash with soap and water while moving the crown around. Seems to fix it for a few days until more dirt gets in there. 
Superman statue 
Wow!! Where can I get one?
Good bot
No problem. Cheers. 
It just the cartoony brainiac. The one in photo is from the LEGO DC Super Heroes Brainiac Attack Set #76040. 
No problem. I’ve been bugging my wife all week with it. It’s great
I think there were a few other apps people had shared in this post. Or you can just use it for free with no repeat option. 
Nice
Mug life is funny. 
Good bot
Ya I didn’t really care to get it until I saw the bottle. 
Don’t understand why the mini figs don’t have full sized legs. Can’t they just sit?
Totally!!
It was one of the reasons I bought the Mk3. Also it’s a lock ass printer. 

Also my buddy bought one a week later after telling him they use printers to make more printers.

So yes the marketing value is very high
Damn that amazing. Ordered a MK3 last week. End of March can’t come fast enough. 🤞
I don’t think so, because they allow Live Photos as your watch face. This app just converts the gif to a live photo format. 

it seems to depend on gif length. 
I think so
Pretty simple once you figure it out I guess. 
Lol. Cheers
Doesn’t seem too affect it that much. Last night before bed my watch was 62% charged. 
Cheers
1x will work too. Depending on the length of the gif you may want to add the repeat. If the gif is short then the 2x or 3x makes it longer and thus looks cooler.

Why is step 10 afraid of step7? 

Because 7 ate 9. Shit that’s means 10 is next dude!!
Lol
Not entirely sure
Ya it sucks but whatever it’s a cup of coffee. 
Thanks for the tip
This is the most important step of them all
It may be related to length. If they are too long they may not work
Ya I kept getting the black face too. I would give up and retry a few days later. Then I discovered the damn key frame thing. Blew the case wide open!
Cool. I’ll have to check it out

Haha yes!!
Damn I totally forgot about screen recording. Thanks for the tip

No problem kind sir

That I think only shows Live Photos. You need something that converts the gif to live photo. 
It’s very satisfying that it loaded the watch face that quickly. I was a little worried it wouldn’t load to the watch so quickly and it would be just another watch face. I would have egg on my face then. Haha
There is always an app for that
Your gif may be too long. Maybe try setting the key frame in the middle or an app that can trim gifs.

I tried to make one but I’m not sure Workflow can export Live Photos yet but I would love a working workflow for this. 
No problem. Good luck;)
Thanks. I had no idea how to do it either and it was pretty hard to find decent instructions. I spent too much time trying to figure it out. Decided no one else should have this much pain, so I made a video. 

It’s was the damn key frame set to the last frame that was killing me.

The video game is great. But the board game will last a life time. Lol. I’d start with the video game. Then in a while after you are bored of it get the board game.

2) 1080p picture, price cut and better collection of high quality games.

The Xbox 360 power supply supports 16amps! 

The MPSM power supply that came with my unit only supported 7amps. After doing a bit or research I found a lot of people had issues with the 7amp power supply. Some units come with. 10 amp supply which was a little better. 

Oh And the Xbox power supply has a fan.  BOOM!

Check my post above for instructions. 
Cut the connector off your MPSM’s power supply.

I pause quite often to change colours and it works great!

After loading the new filament manually feed some through the nozzle. Also I find turning up the temp by 5 degrees and slowing the printer down to 0.5 for the first layer or two, after the resume, helps the new layer bond to the last layer. 
No thanks

Oh you must mean the cost of iOS. 
Yes I’m happy to pay a little more for a better OS. 

I’m not sure the build quality has exceeded Apple. Some of the android phones are on par with build quality and others are pure garbage. 

 ex. Exploding phones, bad OLED viewing angles, weird OLED blue color shifts, screen burn in, phones made of cheep plastic, and the Android OS is meh too.

I have the uhd65 and am loving it. It’s similar to the uhd60. Make two colour profiles one for HDR10 content and one for non HDR10 content. 
I find this set too weird to buy. 
Very nice truck. Love the matching colour of the grill letters. 
Nope. Should just pop down like a notification. 
Didn’t have any gold PLA, so I decided to pause the print and paint it. Fingers crossed. 


[update: final pic](https://i.imgur.com/uNfTRkD.jpg) 
I bought it at Boxing Day and It’s been great so far. Running a basic 5.1 JBL speaker system.  Have an Apple TV 4K and PS4 connected to it. And the HDMI 2 output is connected to the Optoma UHD65 4K projector. Everything works great. 
I didn’t notice that before. Oh it’s because it is from the Batman LEGO movie
True. Kinda a cross between Superman the movie and man of steel. Especially that it comes with an armour chest plate. 
Hope these photos help. Maybe it’s only allowed after the subscription, now I’m not sure as I subscribed right away.

I went to a LEGO store and an employee there helped me find the new Batman Movie series 2 poly bags with Jor-El and Zod. He was a big help as he knew what was in each bag just by feeling the pieces. 
Sold it a while ago
Yes it did. How many of the same cupboard opening animations did they think they could show me before I’d get mad?
Yup. They need to build a fully working city. Interiors an all
The next step for these open world games is being able to walk into all buildings and also destroying everything to the ground. And less repetitive gameplay. 
I with this had coop on PS4. I loved this game
Nope. Just more precise weather. 
Seems to work great for me. I subscribed to the $12/year upgrade. I love the snark. When it tells me it fucking snowing outside I always smile and show others around me. 
Is this a dice tower? Do you have an STL
Forgot the raft he was the captain on that too. Wilson was his first mate
Excellent. 
Agreed
Love my Apple Watch. No regrets.
Any good?
Haha
No thanks
I had a silver Sony one of those. It looks so awesome. It could hold 3 cds too!!
Sorry I meant most complex games. 
Sorry I meant in general. Most complex games are hard to teach new people how to play. 

Ticket to ride is pretty easy to explain and also flip the FUCKEN BOARD OVER BECAUSE SOMEONE BLOCKED YOUR FUCKEN TRAIN.... calm down!! I’m good!!
I find this doesn’t always work. When it does it awesome. But when it doesn’t I want to toss my X out the window. 
It’s very hit and miss, mostly miss. Sometimes I just want one word on a website. Next thing I know I  have the whole website selected. 
RemindMe! 60 Days
Ticket to ride. I tossed the board once. I don’t play that game anymore. 

Also explaining games to new players is very frustrating. You tell them a rule but they have no idea it’s relation to the game play. Then they get to the point where that rule is needed and they say “ well you never told me that rule”. Grinds my gears!!!

Edit: I meant explaining complex games is difficult. Ticket to ride is easy to explain. 
Thanks :)
Vallejo model paint. They have a line of metallic colours what are awesome. 
The Luke lightsaber cost me $2.52 in PLA gray filament. It used about 93 feet of filament and took about 11 hours. 

So you set it at dinner time and when you wake up in the morning you have yourself a lightsaber. 

[photo](https://i.imgur.com/bTq5tig.jpg) 
Ain’t nobody got time for that
Hopefully there is a proper insulator between the high voltage and low voltage circuits or you see flames
The mono price select mini is $200. There is a pretty big community around it. So there is lots of help. And the cool part is you can print upgrade parts and make the printer better. WIN!

Filament is pretty cheap too. A 1kg roll costs $25ish, depending on type. So it works out to a few cents to dollars to print something. 
If I close my eyes it does
It still blows my mind every time I print something. 
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1538383

Currently printing Luke’s lightsaber.
Took about 30 hours and a few hours to paint it. 
It has some x axis wobble but it came out pretty damn nice.

Currently printing Luke’s lightsaber.
28 hours. Terminator skull pen holder. 
Set to reference color mode and watch planet earth 2. For the love of god watch that first. You will not want to stop watching it. My eyes melted into my head. I have seen the first episode of part 2 6 times now. The intro is amazing. I want to to be the intro to all my movies. 
Projector Optoma UHD65 
That band... love it
Sorry you’ll have to buy the PS4 pro to have that feature
Do it!
Lol. The seats are actually super comfy and having the row in front gives it more of a movie theatre feel. Also it sits at a good height. 
Thanks
It’s called days end. 
It’s off to the side so it shouldn’t be a problem. I can stand under it and not hit my head. (6feet tall)

Also, I don’t need friends now that I have this. All people In the movies are life size. 
35x11
Thanks. 
I wish I could remember. We got it 4 years ago from Leon’s Furniture (Canada). It’s pretty cool because you can buy extra parts to add on to it. But they probably don’t make it anymore. Lol
~~Cool thanks. I may do that just to see if I like it better. ~~

I moved the seat back 2 feet. It’s working out great. Thanks for the tip ;)
No popcorn machine yet. It’s on the list of things to get. 

Ya the marquee is addictive. I won’t let people down until it has the movie name on it. Lol
11 feet. Probably should movie it back a bit. It’s kinda cool close as it looks HUGE. LOL. 

Originally the projector was much lower so I was trying to prevent people in the 2nd row from hitting their heads. The PJ is much higher now so I could movie everything back a bit. 
Not yet. I don’t really have any at the moment. But I assume it won’t be great. 

I’m playing worms battlegrounds right now. Lol!! it looks great! 

Also tried Saints Row 4 online and it was good. 
Loving the UHD65. Planet earth looks epic on it. 
I haven’t played too many games on it yet, But the few time I have it’s been fine. 

The one thing is if the content is not UHD, set up a separate color profile for non UHD content it will look much better. 
Optoma UHD65 Projector
120” EluneVision Screen
Apple TV 4K
PS4
Denon AVRS730H receiver
JBL fronts and centre
Polk Audio rear speakers
Subwoofer (i have idea but it sucks)
Philips Hue lighting system. 

Next to upgrade are the speakers, popcorn machine, beer fridge, and a high top bar with bar stools. 
I love my plasma. It’s a 60incg Panasonic from 2012. The black are rich and colours are so nice. I will have it until the day it dies. Then I would probably buy a decent OLED. 
Why would any one go into space naked?and also with a skin helmet and air tank. Seems like you’re going to have a bad time. 
I don’t know about this. Seems like it might not work as well as they advertise. 
I play it in our van all the time. Image was a little off center, but it was an easy fix in the config file. Maybe try changing the HDMI mode. I think that’s in the config file too. 
Any updates on the dark knight 4K iTunes release? I still see it as HD in Canada. 
Where is bond when we need he. He fixed the spectre problem pretty quickly. 
It doesn’t work. But does sound better. That is all
This!!
Just try it. Just once
It  was safe for work
I think it’s the way the projector handles changing colour modes. 
Lol
I have handoff enabled but it will not pass it to the iPhone by swiping up. I get the keypad option and audio source- watch or AirPods. 
Just got an Apple TV 4K and iTunes 4K looks great IMO. Running it on a 120” screen with the Optoma UHD65 4K projector 
Lol
Until my buddy realized this and texted me happy New Year 25 tines. My watch almost exploded. 
Why Kender Surprise Eggs are illegal in the US

[video](https://youtu.be/ffzbfO0c5Qs) 
Lol
So lame
Haha!
All the time 
I laughed out loud. Thank you
It’s a thrift shop
The worst part is. I didn’t buy it when I saw it. I was kicking myself all night. Then went back in the morning and it was still there. An old man was looking at it. I walked up and just stared at him until he awkwardly moved away. 
Thanks. Looks great. Can’t wait to get mine set up
How low is your projector mounted? 
What is your Distance from screen to projector 
Did you find the 15% offset too little?
I love the look of these speakers but found the horns made me want to rip off my ears. Every time I see them I think”I should try these again, they are inexpensive and looks sweet.” Then I remember my ears bleeding. 

I read somewhere a guide to padding the horns. Makes them much less sharp. 


I read this to my daughter this morning
Take my money!!!!!!
Cool
Specific sets usually. 
Good bot
What mods?
Haha. I think your joke has gone over everyone’s head. Well played sir
Ya I agree. I’m going to upgrade it to floss
Just scrolling through google images.

I hate to say it but this was one of my most disappointing games. 
Do it
How far down is your projector?
If you turn pure motion to 0 does it help at all. 
I also enjoyed Justice league. 
BvS has too many issues to enjoy. The longer version made way more sense. But there is just to much filler in that movie. 

Justice league was pretty good. It was much better than I expected. It was Fun, had a simple story and wasn’t too long. 
Does it feel laggy?
Just looking to get a projector. Seeing it’s the first kinda real (we’ll more real than others) 4K projector that’s not $7000

I guess I’m comparing it to the Optoma uhd60
How are you liking the projector overall?
Do you game on it at all? If so how does it handle it?
What PureMotion setting are you one. I’ve read 1 is the best setting for minimum soap opera effect. 
I’m buying a UHD65 next week and hope the PureMotion doesn’t bother me. 

Wow nice job
That’s a great gift. I’ll print one (1) for all my friends. They can share in the holiday cheer
Ya my 6s stopped working when the X came out. Probably because I bought the X and turned it off. Lol
Correction: 

Planned obsolescence is designing the product to only last until the X. Which many people experience.


See what I did there. 
Have you even seen the moon and sun in the same place at the same time? Nope. They are the same person. Just saying. 
I have always liked it. They opened with it I. Toronto and it was sweet. 
Probably okay. It’s low voltage. 
The division 
Looks pretty cool.

The thing I have always disliked about this game series (and most other open world games) is the repetition. There are many missions but so many are the same it just gets boring after a while. Climbing towers to active the same freaking radio thing go annoying pretty fast. 
My wife and I towed a travel trailer 16 hours and it was quite a ride. Had to fill up almost every 1.5 hours. 
Looks and size. It’s not a small ranger and not a huge Ram. It’s a wonderful midsize. And it looks awesome. I find the tundra a little to curvy. I think with the right mods it could look mean though. 
Gta3
It’s a wifi speaker system. 
✈️
😐
You got it!!
I also like the term walnut. “You walnut”
We don’t have it here in Canada yet. Still have to test it out in cold weather maybe. See if it functions in an igloo or in an hockey arena. 
I love how the star destroyer is looming in the background. This is a great village. Nice job!
I get jokes
Chicken butt?
I don’t think this post is to show what it looks like dude! I’m pretty sure it’s regarding the deal he got. I for one thought this was an interesting and informative post. 
It seem pretty cool. But I’ll wait until the next gen is $200. 
I bought [this one ](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01AT23UGE/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_mGglAb7RNKXC1) and use USBC to micro USB.it supports 3 amps. I then can plug my pico projector into the 120v plug and can charge my 8BITDO controllers using the other USB ports 
Looks great
Yes. My god!
What set is that?
Very nice
Damn very nice. Is that a flat burnt orange?
Because you can
I don’t get why people want different keyboard. Seems odd to me. What’s wrong with the stock keyboard?
Very nice
This is also true
Except it’s on the main page
Awesome. Great work
Lol. His eyes have been ripped out of his head!
Awe
Haha. I should paint the ends white 
Haha. Ya clear red would be perfect. I couldn’t find clear red in my bin :(
Thank god someone posted this. 
I didn’t. 
Spyfall 1 is great. Never tired 2 but read somewhere 1 was better. 
Never had to use it. But my 1- 1/2 year old activated it while we were driving. It called 911 and I just explained it was my child playing with my iPhone. Glad know it work though :|
This post shows how toxic this sub has become.
Stay away. It’s toxic here. Just enjoy your device. 
Who’s is everyone? A bunch a people on reddit?Millions of people use it everyday with no issues. My self included. I have few small UI issues sometimes. 

This sub has just become a place to complain about stupid shit. Maybe try restarting your phone more then once a year. This sub has become a shit hole of complaints and bitching. 
Too much boarder. Blah! What is this 2015
Some guys been parked in my spot for two weeks. Damn it man
Open world Superman game. You can play as Clark Kent and investigate things. Then change in to Superman and fight bad guys. 
Damn nice truck. Looks very much like mine. 
Agreed, it basically people complaining about stupid glitches, showing their new iPhone, and showing their aging case. Oh and iphone wallpapers that use the notch in some way. Though this one is kinda funny. 
How can I watch this in higher res on my X
And nothing happened. 
I love my wireless charging. Just place my phone on my night stand and it’s charged in the morning. 

Before that I would be half a sleep fumbling around with the damn cord. 
First off trying to find the damn thing because it fell behind the fucking bed. 
And then trying to plug it in the small hole in the dark. My ports were always scratched to shit. 

Then add the nights I’m drunk as fuck and the cord ends up being wrapped around my neck and I die in my sleep. Fuck that I’ll take the wireless charging. It won’t try and strangle me in the night. 
Put your balls on the charging pad. Now you’re ready for SEXY TIME!!
Integration with my other devices.

Looks slicker than windows

Less issues. I manage 13 windows machines. And I just hate using them. 

Security. Less viruses and such. (Up until root login mistake) 

Ease of use. Doing something on Mac OS just makes sense. On windows to do anything is a chore.

Nice. Was that custom made
What!! No dlc, no micro transactions, no updates!! It just the game in all its glory? Those were the days. 
Ah sweet. Thanks 
If people buy it, they will still do it. And some people don’t care if they have to spend more money. Unilateral because it’s their parents money.
Yes it is and worth the monthly fee of a buck if you want to add the extras. 
You are not being unfair. It’s a dollar a month. I find that in my couch easily enough to pay for the app. Keep doing what you are doing because it’s great. 
Apple is designing hardware and software for the new generation. My grandma who is 90 bought an iPad. Fuck it’s hard to teach someone 3D Touch, Siri, swipe up and so on. I disabled everything I could. She thinks Siri is an actual person and was surprised when I called her from my phone at the same time. 


Agreed
It should just be the home bar. 
Faster but cost more to buy. I bought the 29w charger/USB c cable from Apple. And also the USB c car charger from Belkin. They charge fast but is not cheap. 
Hell no. Did a bear inspect it before they shipped it
No
Touch ID usually would fail more often than work for me. Face ID is much more reliable for me. I run an edging lab for lenses and my hands are always dirty, wet and cracked. So it was always a battle to get it to work. With Face ID I just pick up the phone and start using it. It’s ways easier to just pick up my phone and it’s already logged in. I don’t have to place my thumb on the button, hope it works, when it doesn’t. I have to reposition and try again. 
It’s a pretty simple design rule. Have the main button you use always in the same spot. Like for websites the navigation bar should always stay the same no matter what page you are viewing. 
Just the the home button did /s
Exactly. It does not
It’s just an office phone. For taking photos and controlling Sonos. Not sure it’s needs to be an iPhone X to do that. 
Nice job on the design. 
Well it could still be at the bottom while in landscape too. 

But it should always be near the lightning port of the phone regardless of orientation. 
Comment win. You win all prizes. 
And where are those tin cans now? The would still work ya know. 
Oh the game is called For$ale
Gave it to my daughter so I needed a new phone.

I really miss the feature of the cord to pull around the phone. I may have to get a cord installed on my X, just so I can drag it around. 
There is a cord attached to the phone that is used for pulling it around. I had to buy a special lightning adaptor to connect to it. It took 83hours to transfer everything. The hardest part was the phone numbers because they were stored as amount of rotations for each number. So a special program had to be used to translate rotations back in to actual digits. Very complex math involved. 
Well this is the reddit for iPhone. Not sure why this is posted here.
This company is a scam. Dont waste your time
I used an iPhone 6s Plus with OS 11 until I got my X and it ran fine.

I like it too. 
Yes. Many times during the day. 
So wrong 
Or be able to move it as desired. Whatever way they have it now sucks. 
As others said you can bend the tab at the end a bit. 
Haha yes! We have a iPhone 5c for my staff that I was using, I swiped up so many times to get to the home screen I laughed out loud. 

My staff think I’m nuts... 🥜

I would only make it through half a day with my iPhone 6S plus. Now I still have 30% left when going to bed. I charge it every night on a wireless Belkin pad. Really loving this phone
I never got into this game. Played it for a few days and it never stuck. I wish I had enjoyed it but I never knew where to go and what to do
Does not explain why all my teeth hurt. 
iMac graphite DV special edition. Got it in 2001. Man I loved that iMac. Ran Final Cut Pro v1. It was amazing.

Meh. Buying Apple products from the Apple store is more more enjoyable than best buy. 
Waiting for the iPhone SE X
This is true
Sometimes I just get the desire to watch something filling the screen. Something satisfying about it. 
Lol thanks. 
I really like the width of this phone thou. I think all iPhone’s have always needed to crop the videos in full screen. 
That’s not a tree, that’s a hair brush. You’re a phoney! A big phoney!!

Nice work btw


Dark dude very dark
I use the same watch face but with no complications. It’s very calming on days of high stress. Lol
Red ages horribly. My wife had it and it went dirty red and black
Tell the time is a feature 
X. Loving it
The line seems like an odd thing to have at all. I know where to swipe up.
I believe Apple won’t allow this. Not sure but pretty sure. 
Never watch anything in 3D
Do you have some photos. The site wants me to login to view. 
Not sure how well they age. Maybe why we never see other colors. 
Very nice. I also have the same sliding door
My wife also says her iPhone 6s+ is running fine and she loves complaining. Lol
I have very few issues. Minor graphic overlays sometimes. But it’s been pretty smooth sailing. Sorry it’s not working out for you. 
I saw a dad at Best Buy pick it up I wish I had told him don’t get it but didn’t want to get into it. 
Why wasn’t it dark side. Damn it
Ouch  EA you’re getting  beat down for being dicks. 
I find my battery is double my 6s+. It lasts my whole work day now and I unusually only plug it in if I’m watching videos at home after dinner. 
Love my X. 

The screen is clear, bright and beautiful. 
The size is perfect (coming from a 6s+)
FaceID is slick and works honestly 95%of the time. Touch ID for me work 75% of the time I think. Because my hands are rough and dirty most of the day I guess. Lol
The swipe home button is also so easy to use. I was worried it would be hard to adapt to. But it was easy to learn and the button seems so lame now. Lol

I don’t notice the notch anymore. It never really bothered me in photos. I thought it would suck to watch a video with, but now I feel disappointed if something I’m watching won’t allow me to scale it to full screen. 

Oh and the wireless charging is awesome for beside my bed.
 Fucken hated trying to find the cable in the dark, then try to stick it in the tiny lightning hole. All my iPhones have been scratched to fuck around the lightning port. 
Now I just get in bed and set my phone on the pad. Boom done like dinner!
People just love to complain it’s human nature. 
I was just looking for that little x. 
The top half should be 2100 as well 
Every time I set my alarm I check all volume levels. I do a test alarm volume 
God damn he is such a cool guy 
Yes
Agreed. It could have been so so good. 
I think this is a good idea
He got a refund on being born. 
I knew it was an ea joke before I even clicked the link. I said to my self “who the fuck would charge do every little thing?.. EA!”
This
Lol
Awesome
Model paint nd spray paint for plastic works. Use a gray primer first 
This is not the game you are looking for

Edit: This is not the game anyone is looking for. 
the home button is confusing now, the bezel is in the way,. My wife has a 6s+ in an Otterbox defender ( I also had one) and it’s freaking huge. 
I love it beside my bed at night. I would struggle to plug my 6s+ in every night. My lightning port is scratched to shit on my 6s+. 
The card has to be left in the controller all the time
Would this game be fun for 4 buddies online? Do you have to play with other people? Can you just send lay 4 co-op?
My brother called to get a refund. He waited so long he starved to death!
The money they make from micro transactions probably is more than the money they would have made from the angry people buying their game. 
Cool I bought the Belkin one. It’s awesome. 
It’s got Kryptonite inside and lights up. It’s from Superman Returns. Not in the movie just something sold at that time
This
I never pre ordered and am not buying it. I always find EA have problems connecting. I spend 30mins trying to get into a fucken game. Play for 30 and then it’s off to bed. Fuck that. Most other online games work fine. Just EA games like battlefront and battlefield. 
Same. ¼ of a game for $80 fuck that shit
Smart
Until you realize you up against kids using their parents CC to buy +40% attack and defence. No
More fun for you
They need to have two sections to this game. The pay to win section. And the just play to have fun. 

If you buy something to advance yourself you can freely play with it in the play to win section. 

Or you can disable all your play to win advancements and play it the let’s just have fun section. 

Same game, same missions and such. Just two areas. 
They kinda worked. But the support material was too much to remove from each part. I kinda gave up, so all in all it was a failure. I might try it again and play around with less support. 
2% not saying it’s bad but critics hate DC movies. 
It looked cool. Lol

I figured the parts were small, better safe then sorry. I also like when my brims connect. The sum is greater than the parts. 

Glass is amazing
Lol
I’m dying to try them. 
Wow. This is so easy to do my grandma did it just yesterday. Man Apple really needs to fix this. /s

What if someone removes my face. Then they can just take my phone and my life. What ever can we do to prevent this. 
If the App Store was full of apps like this then I would agree. But honestly this guy made something new and it’s pretty awesome. How else can he get noticed? The App Store is a shot show of free IAP games. Cut the dude some slack.
Bought it. Very well done. 

Not sure if it’s possible but you should add the ability to knock over the blocks with your hand. 
That’s fair
It takes a real man to admit they were wrong. You sir are a kind person. May you have a great day. 
Neat but Incorrect for 3D printing. It references how high each layer will be in mm. The thinner the layer the smoother the part will be. 
Layer hight, in regards to 3 D printing, is how high each layer will be when printing (in mm). 

Some super smart guy (not me) calculated the amount of motor turns and belt movement on this specific printer (MP SELECT MINI) to determine the best layer heights (in mm) for printing. It’s the best number to use for layer heights in mm

The lower the number the smoother the print, but the longer the print time. 0.175mm is what I usually print at. 

I hope this was correct and makes sense. 
Not sure yet. It just finished and I have to go to work now :(. They look like Lego from afar. 
Bingo
Bahhh. Total BS from EA. Ummm no it’s because you know idiots will buy them. From a business standpoint it’s smart. For all the people who don’t buy the game because of micro transactions many many more will buy the game and those micro transactions. 
I absolutely love my X. 
I do it. Lol it’s very enjoyable 
[here ya go :P](https://i.imgur.com/KbWHqUD.jpg) 
This is the sad part... it probably will do great. And people will buy the micro transactions. Because people are fucking stupid. 
To tell the time
Put your glass bed in the freezer. The thing will pop off very easily 
Unfortunately there is a huge number people who buy this crap and than buy micro transactions because they have mom and dads CC
Unfortunately the handful of angry people on reddit are much less than the idiots who will buy this game and buy micro transactions. 

Fuck this game. 
Omg. I’m totally acting now!! Thanks for the deal
It’s odd they got rid of the 2 and not the 1
You can install a complication that allows you to put emojis but it take a spot on your watch face and doesn’t do anything other than show an emoji. 
Flags would be cool!
You have inspired me to remove 2 keys. Thank you kind sir. 
I probably never will but in the case of your Uber I would be like bam!! I got that shot on my keychain 
I’ll look when I get home. My slicer program should tell me. 
I don’t use 3.5mm for anything anymore. More if I’m at someone’s house and they are living in the stone ages with a stupid AUX cable
Lol. 
Face ID is much more natural. I can just pick up my phone and go. With Touch ID I had to rest my thumb wait. Hope it works. Dry my hand off. Try again and so on. Usually if Touch ID failed once it would mean I would try two more times and have to enter my passcode. With Face ID if it fails the first time it has a higher chance of working the second time. 

I found Touch ID worked 70-80 % of the time for me. Face ID is 90%
You bet 2013
Meh. Could be worse. Could be in the Stone Age just trying not to be eaten by a fucken lion. 
Why not. Never know. And it’s cool to print 3D things 
Same
So many stupid people will buy this shit. Fucken destroying the gaming industry 
I have a pair. But this is just incase I need to blast my music on a buddies system that uses Aux only. 
Lol nice
Truck key, truck cap key, truck bed key, mini Swiss Army knife, tile, 256GB USB, and headphone doohickey. Any less and I’d be missing that item. 
Lol
Love them. They work 99.9% of the time. I was worried it be one of those thing that would be cool
And work at first but then just stop working after a while. But I’ve had it for 6+ months with only a few failed tries. Actually couldn’t find my wallet this morning. My 16 month old hid it in the couch. Found it in 5 seconds while heading out the door. 

I have one on my keys, wallet, tv remote and one on my mantle... invade I lose the mantle. Lol. Jk it’s so if I can’t find my iPhone I just go to the button on the mantle and boom I can beep it. 

Also my wife has one on her keys and purse. 
I don’t. Ask me in a year how many times I’ve used this thing. I bet only once or twice.  
Omg agreed!! Really loving my iPhone X. Went from a 6s+ and the new size is so comfortable. 

But the 3rd party developers really need to get on with the updates, some are just being lazy as fuck. 
I laughed. I read it in homers voice. 
Ya I printed that first, but someone here mentioned it could break off inside the headphone jack unless I printed it in a stronger material. 

The metal one would not break though. 
The home bar and rounded corners crop it. 
That’s Awesome your library has a 3D printer. It was about 0.05 to print from my MP Mini Select. 
Here is the STL I used. Whoever made it did a great job. Incase you would like to print it too.

Now with less chance of breaking
Damn you beat meeeeee
7 ate 9
Apple needs to sell a case like this. 
What delay. 
Lol. Just having some funn
NOOOOOOOOO!!!! Haha wow! That’s a pretty stupid mistake I made. Not sure how I missed that. Thanks. 

They say if you want people to notice your posts make a mistake in the title. Win!
Agreed. Maybe I needed to give it more time. But I just found it gave me anxiety looking at the list of posts. 
I always forget it’s in the top right. Should be bottom left
Face ID has fixed this issue for me. It’s so slick looking at notifications on the lock screen now. Just life your phone and click the notification. Boom you’re now dealing with it instead of looking at the home screen
Or you just accept the minor inconveniences of iOS and don’t switch to
Android because it’s much worse. 
This
Lol. It was. 
Lol
Wait the guy was friends with a hitman?
I must say I am loving Face ID. It’s very smooth and if it fails it usually works the next time. If Touch ID failed it would rent not to work until I cleaned my hands or touch sensor. 
We all knew this was going to happen. It’s sad but if I️ owned R* I’d do the same thing. There will always be idiots that buy this crap. 

IMOA micro transactions ruined GTA ONLINE. Hopefully it will not ruin this game. 
Probably has a pile of the ready for winter. 
A ❓ didn’t know. 
Bah! Very clever. And now I have this bug. 
Wish Apple would add the ability to open and change preferences. Seeing they own the open now. They should open up its abilities beyond what they allow other apps. 
That’s why my watch had a red screen. Lol. I was very confused. Thanks 
Ah good point. Thanks
I did :)
It’s much more natural to use then Touch ID. It works much better too. And when it doesn’t it usually works the second time. Where if Touch ID didn’t work the first go there is a high chance it wouldn’t work because my hands are wet or whatever. 
Not supported in the app yet
The phone should catch on fire at the end. 
Everyone

Sweet thanks. Any other symbols we can put there. 
It sucks big time. 
Ah. I’ll give this a try.

I used a 3D XL grip STL. Just messed with the sizing until it fit. Works great. 

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1816570

I don’t remember what size because I had to print it in two parts are my deb would not fit it
How about some decent co-op games. 
😂 
Using this [one](https://i.imgur.com/YfKAUtZ.jpg) 
Wow didnt realize the pixel was that bad
It is. Love the look with leather and black clasps. Two tone is sweet. 

[photo](https://i.imgur.com/XgCtZ4o.jpg) 
It’s funny I actually didn’t notice it. It’s on the same screen. Lol
It’s very natural. Maybe because I’ve been mentally preparing for it. Practicing on my 6s+
3:10 am on the pre order morning. Got one right away. 
Yes. Same. 3 swipes up and in like wtf. Then I remember. But the home swipe is very natural. 
It’s cool to show people 
It’s like meant to be there. It’s just the look of it now.
Lol
I restored from an iPhone 6s+ back up
Or just notchiced!
Thanks it worked
That did it. Thanks
I keep getting an error message. Saying format not excepted. But it if I mark up the photo which removes the live part it works okay. 
Agreed. The iPhone X is not food
That’s true. 
Or drinking wine
This is true. 
Nah. It’s fine. Really loving this phone. The notch is not that bad people just like to complain. 
Do you want some cheese with that wine
They could cut back on the amount of emojis and focus more on bugs maybe. 
Oh nice. I have not look at that yet!
It is :). Loving it. 
Four.one
What a waste /s
I run an optical and have been testing our sunglasses with Face ID. it seems most sunglasses work great. But the two in the photo. 

It’s strange, the one on the left in [this photo](https://i.imgur.com/0Hambkv.jpg) works while a very similar frame on the right does not. They are relatively the same frame with similar lenses. 

The only other pair that did not work [is this one](https://i.imgur.com/cVsd3zr.jpg) which is not surprise as they are huge and ugly. 

We have a huge [wall](https://i.imgur.com/nha7qfL.jpg)  of sunglasses and I have not found any other sunglasses that don’t work. 


Tell me about it. Good lord
[yay! it came at 11am! Ontario Canada](https://i.imgur.com/QS2IvQu.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/zNkUZHe.jpg) 

Upgraded from 6s+
Return it. Someone else will definitely want it more than you. 
Thanks might give it a try

What’s the deal with the lack of good coop games recently. Fuck
I’ll believe it when I’m playing it and it’s a decent game
Is this game super complicated. 
Hero scape was not worth it. 
I think this guys drunk
No thanks
This
Lol
Love it or hate it Apple products always have hype. Why? Because they make products people want to line up for. I am not saying they are good or bad products. But everyone can agree they can build hype and make people excited or angry. 

I honestly can’t remember the time an Android  phone had that type of hype...People lining up, news coverage, commercials, People debating 24/7 if it’s crap or good, live events people talk about the next day. It’s literally on every news station the next morning. 

I think everyone can agree there is hype. You may not agree to what they are hyping but it’s there. 

Hell even my grandparents who don’t own a computer and use a flip phone know when the new iPhone is coming out. And they don’t even know what it is. 


No idea. My wife left her iPhone on my truck roof. It flew off and landed in the centre part of the highway by my house. I found the found in 5 mins of searching at 10pm in pitch black. It was 2 feet from the dot on the “find my iPhone app”
I love living in Canada. 
I have a @Mac.com account and it’s the best. 

Never going to give it up!
OMG that car will never sell. No one will buy it. Ever! It’s goi g to fail. How can anyone even see out the window?  The notch takes up everything. Notchcargate 2017!!!! Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha NOTCH!!!! /s


Awe no one liked my joke. Downvote away if you must!


Ah. Of course I won’t be able to hide or delete the app if I don’t subscribe to Apple Music. 
Mine too. I restarted the watch. Go a loading circle in the radio app and then it went back tot he watch face. Now it’s just blank again. 

Is radio free or is it apart of Apple Music?
Best comment ever! 

Apple kidnapped my brother and will kill him if I don’t buy the iPhone X! Meh never liked my brother anyway. Two timing scam fucking pick balls!! 
Kill him and I’ll also buy the iPhone X win win!
Right but people buy them. So sell them for what people think they are worth not what they are actually worth. 
I think the only way to truly test this is a fresh install of iOS, The Facebook app logged in with a new user account and then test this theory. 

Maybe when I get my iPhone X this week I’ll reset my iPhone 6s + and try it. 


Loved this game
Damn. Having many Feels right in the heart. 
He is amazing. His smile brings so much joy.  
So many memories with these
“tests show that the Pixel 2 XL is not any worse than other phones when it comes to burn-in. “

Lol it’s not any worse guys. Come on!! That’s not a great line to use in marketing. 

Hey guys we’re not any worse than the other guys so.... ya know... buy our product. 
Got nov 3rd delivery too. Yay.
Same
Got mine in Canada. Ships Nov 3
Printed it and it works greats!
This seems odd we can’t look ahead. Did they just forgot to add this feature or something?

Can the Apple Watch ‘camera remote’ app change camera modes? 
A bought an Asus E1 for this exact reason. It works really well. It’s not HD and won’t provide amazingly clear video but it works with the system surprisingly well. 

I also loaded kodi with some SD movie and it makes a great travel system. 

It’s more of the small, compact and easy set up wow factor than the amazing high resolution type wow factor. 
I have 6s + and did not use the headphone jack this year. 
Yes we are. 
Bought mine off Amazon.ca. A little more expensive but worth it IMO. 
iPhone SE X
7 ate 9
Lol. Stocks up
This is amazing
Damn that’s a tough one. I like both. But I’ll be gone gives me a little more “feelings”
Mine seems to be fine. A few UI issues that a quick force quit app won’t solve. 6s+
Needs more audio
Haha. They last released one 1099 days ago. They seem to really care about the Mac mini. Didn’t he say this a while ago. 
My wife loves these. Can’t get them here in Canada. She always sticks up when we go to the US.

When you take a photo of your wrist leave on Live Photos. When you add it to your watch it will look like it’s your actual wrist. 

When I put the photo on my watch and it started to move it scared the shit outa me. I though I was looking right at my skin. Lol
$20 can of plasti dip. It’s so easy to do. Save yourself lots of money 
Awesome idea thanks
Im a huge Superman fan. 

A guy I was working with was wearing a Superman shirt with an emblem that most people would have no idea what it was. 

I said “nice kindom come shirt dude.”

He said “what?” 

your SuperMan shirt is cool. 

He said “oh that. Ya I just wear it because people call me SuperMan.”

I ended the conversation and never spoke with him again. 
See kids this is why you don’t do drugs. 
Very nice. The topper was sweet though. 
Bought 4
I like it. The critics can say whatever the fuck they want. I’m still going to watch it until I get bored of it. 
I plug my phone into my Mac once a week to back up and store my photos. 
 
I do agree Bluetooth is much better. I have a pair of Bose QC35s and they are the best headphones I have ever had. Planning on getting some airpods this week for everyday use. 
Can’t stand this either. I sent them a feature request too. Everyone needs to do this too
Plasti dip solves all problems

Go to the Kentucky Derby. It was hell on earth
There they go copying Apple again /jk
But Apple owns Workflow now. 
Ya same here. Google failed me
I put a TILE Mate on my remote. Now I just beep it with my phone 50 times a day
Lol. I get what you are saying. 

They could have used monkeys with wings glued on. Just saying. 
Looks awesome!
Ah thanks. Thus the dots for cell signal 
Arrrg... so much CG!!!!
Yes
Excited to try this out
I new it
Lol. Totally a joke
Damn you are correct kind sir

Here is a video of my issue

First Apple Watch and I’m loving it. 
I think it’s hilarious. 
My wife and I got in an accident bringing home a new car seat in a box. The insurance company replaced it for free. 
[SOLVED]I noticed it was showing a stocks app icon for the complication. I deleted the stocks app off my iPhone years ago. So I re-downloaded it and boom fixed.  I then deleted the stock app off my phone  and it still seems to be working okay. 
I forced quit the app and also restarted it. Still there. Also when I scroll through other complications I get a weird bounce.
I work in a lab in a basement and have no cell phone reception. I use FaceTime audio to make all my calls. It’s so clear
Bahahahaha! 
Why did they remove this!!!!?!?!!! Makes no sense. 
They sometimes do the weirdest things. 
Is there more than one way to get to the controls for it playing on the iPhone?

 The only way I can figure out right now is to push the button and swipe until I get to now playing. 
What wall thickness did you use? 
The story is terrible. It makes absolutely no sense. But it’s pretty fun otherwise. 
Superman has got a super mullet too. 
Was just in Greece for vacation and found gems. 
She’s always listening. Always on. Always ready to kill
 iPhone x is actually just a software update. It’s stupid how they don’t update all iPhones to be an iPhone X.  The border on the older iPhones is just fake. It’s actually a screen programmed to be a border. What a scam.  /s

Edit: spelling. & added /s
All.the.time.even.when.i.try.hard.not.to. 
That’s why I can’t find my wish list. Wtf
A freeman and his money. There is a difference 
Well said
Lol
It’s a phone
Oh no but I can’t customize my icons. Boo fucking who!!! They are just sad Apple makes a better OS. 
I’ll pass on the discount thanks. Seems like a shitty deal
I got the arrival statue a few years ago and just bought the departure statue. They are really 👍 
It happens all the time for me too. 
Saw this in Greece. 
Then you can just wash them................ loop forever
Coffee could me sex. 
Because people (like me) will buy it. 
Or just be late all the time and then you can show up whenever the hell you want. 
The actually have a whole isle full of them. Just borrow one. 
Or wear a red shirt, give terrible advice and then tell them to bugger off. The customer will find a manger and complain about this random rude employee
Find the biggest guy and beat him up. Now you are king
This
But then you can pet them again... oh shit I see where this is going!!!!
No one needs manuals!

That dresser I bought from ikea turned out to be a coffee table. They ripped me off!! Damn ikea. 
This happened to me. When Thirty Seconds to Mars released their first album I took it on a trip to Cuba. I listened to that album a billion times that week and now associate those songs with relaxing and the beach. 
Should be called iPhone Pro
One big difference they forgot to add. 


iPhone: iOS 
Samsung: Android

I'll be enjoying my iPhone "from 2015" much more than the Samsung phone. Just saying. 
Game over
But I like my iPhone. Is that so fucken hard to understand? I choose to buy iPhones because I enjoy using them. I don't give a shit about other phones because I enjoy my iPhone enough to keep using it. Why is it so hard for android users to understand that. 
This
Apple took one for the team. So now others can follow suit with much less angry customers. 
Sorry meant beside. I'm new to this whole notch terminology 
Lol oh right that one. 
Good to know thanks. Aging looks cool on brown but maybe not so much in blue
Damn I really like he blue version. 
Then buy a different phone. 
I think it will be automatically behind the notch. 
Actually it exactly what I expected. Can't wait to get one. 
People love to hate on Apple because they have nothing better to do. Get a life people it's just a fucking phone. 

Then again I am the one reading the posts about the hate so am I any better? Probably not. 

At first the notch seemed odd mainly because the video clip they showed played in the notch area. But after seeing it automatically plays videos outside the notch area I was sold. 
Don't fix what isn't broke
Just pop in the sim. 
Nah it's because 7 ate 9
Nope
The X pretty much checked every box of things I have want in an iPhone. 
7 ate 9
That's kinda how it worked with jobs at the helm. But ya it's probably impossible tbh. 
My 14 month old daughter loves the home button
7 ate 9
I like my 6s plus but I agree it's sometimes a little bit too wide. Sometimes have to use my nose to push enter if I only using one hand.
