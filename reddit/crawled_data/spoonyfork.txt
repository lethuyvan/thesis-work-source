If the rail is 400# max then I personally wouldn't risk putting over 400# on the rail regardless of what the other pieces are rated for. I recommend using a larger capacity model like 600# one from [Black Widow](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Widow-MX-600X-Motorcycle-Carrier/dp/B002MGKN2A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1525021920&sr=8-1&keywords=black+widow+hitch&dpID=518yDrUgX%252BL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch).

But.. why
The R1200R is pretty comfy. I put 90,000 miles on the stock seat. More to come, knock on wood. 
Not really. I‚Äôve have 5 Senas since the original SMH10 came out. 

SMH10: bulletproof, improved with firmware updates, used it for 3 years, limited to 3 other peeps so we upgraded to...

20S (first): pre-order unit paid top dollar, fell apart in my hands after 2 weeks, plastic latch failed, screws backed out, fuxxored, RMA‚Äôd with SENA and got a replacement...

20S (second): didn‚Äôt fall apart (zip tied it got the mount) but every other firmware update caused multiple issues such as crashing, no voice control with phone, SENA app would crash trying to view address book, and inability to connect with other Senas, it got to the point of being unusable and unreliable. SENA support said I had to restage my iPhone to fix my problems. Nope. 

10S: fed up with the 20S issues I went ‚Äúback‚Äù to the new 10S. Bulletproof. No issues. Firmware updates made it better. Used it for 2 years. Still have it as a backup. I did manage get the 20S working again after a recent firmware update and multiple factory resets. Sold the 20S. 

30K: wanted to skip the pairing with large groups and to be able to talk to more than 3 other people so I bought in the first release. So far so good but one other 30K in mesh I had issues hearing clearly but other mesh ok. I did drop mesh one time and was unable to reconnect insitu even after reboots but later it did. Yes I‚Äôm running the latest firmware. Jury is out. 
Congrats! Now go do a saddle sore iron butt ride (1,000 miles in under 24 hours). 

I‚Äôve done 3 saddle sore iron butts in the last 3 years. The most recent one was around Lake Superior with a bud. If you include the ride up and back to Detroit I did about 1,700 miles in 48ish hours.

The Plugfones block wind noise. I don‚Äôt have the deets in front of me but it is closer to 25db than 32db ear plugs. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear music or riding buds at 70+mph without them. I‚Äôd say the Sena volume is at 1/3 with the Plugfones in.

I really like the concept of a respectful First Nation theme for a name/logo. Seattle itself is named after the Salish chief. However the Rainiers and Totems don‚Äôt ring true. 

Mount Rainier has many names but Tahoma (‚Äúmother of waters‚Äù) is the one I remember most. Tahoma is a powerful image. 

Totems contain imagery intended to communicate a message in a sculpture of wood or stone. Without a specific message the word ‚Äútotem‚Äù doesn‚Äôt carry much meaning. It‚Äôs like called a team ‚Äústreet sign‚Äù or ‚Äústore sign‚Äù or ‚Äústatue‚Äù. Animals on a totem represent aspects of that animal spirit but then why not just use the name of the animal like eagle, raven, bear, beaver. 

First Nations animal imaginary worthy of a professional sport team associated with Seattle that are already in use include Raven, Thunderbird, Orca, Bear, Salmon. In my opinion Thunderbirds would be perfect but it is already used by the successful WHL Seattle Thunderbirds. 

Perhaps a lesser known animal could be considered? Dogfish, Sisiutl (sea serpent). It will probably be kraken and if so I hope they use [Haida inspired imagery for the logo.]( https://www.google.com/search?q=haida+octopus&client=safari&hl=en-us&prmd=isvn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwin2YObxc7ZAhUOEawKHZTFAlMQ_AUIESgB&biw=375&bih=553) Then again the Red Wings might have a claim to cephalopods.

Time to recharge versus refuel is the major limiting factor for electric. Even with quick charges you gotta wait hours to recharge compared with minutes to refuel. Speed, torque, and range aren‚Äôt too much different from similar size ICE motorcycles. In fact you get a lot of toque with electric. Far less maintenance with electric. 

You will hear some people complain that electric motorcycles are too expensive but I think of it as paying for your gas up front. 

You will also hear some people complain about not enough places to charge but in my opinion you have more places and more convenient places to charge than to fuel.
Oh no, the player‚Äôs dads game? These often don‚Äôt go well for us. ü§®
Olympia incentivized west and east clubs to *not* sit in their seats with the free food and drink in the lounges under the seats. Patrons socialize there rather than their seats which creates empty pockets throughout the game in the lower bowl between the blue lines. 

Regardless, fans not at the games complaining about fans not in their seats is ridiculous.

For local fans that want to attend more than a couple games a year consider a season ticket package. I believe they go as low as 9 games and you pay face and one purchase fee of like $5. StubHub the tickets you can‚Äôt use.

This article is confusing to me. There are at least 4 different Al the Octopuses: the giant one sitting outside the Gordie Howe entrance, the inflatable one dropped from the scoreboard and hung up over the ice, and two that hung from the rafters over the east (river) entrance that had 4 wheels. The one in the auction was photographed and [described in the auction](https://www.bidspotter.com/en-us/auction-catalogues/schneiderind/catalogue-id-schneider10235/lot-9144164f-0ed5-4af8-8150-a820017533c8) is one of the ones at the river entrance, not the giant one outside the Gordie Howe entrance like the article describes. 
Southern climate transplants: you can buy those ice scraper thingies at gas stations, auto supply stores, hardware stores, and some department stores.

Keep the ice scraper in your car because it can snow when your car is not at home. For example: at work.

Oops. I didn‚Äôt mean to engage in this type of post. My bad. Sorry. 
Oh no. 

I always felt that the Red Wings lack of alternative jerseys made the special event jerseys (e.g. Winter Classic, Stadium Series) more special and the nearly consistent home/away look for nearly 90 years has a timelessness about it. No need for throwback 3rds when your home/away jerseys are *already* throwbacks. 

The emphasis was on hockey, not aesthetics. I guess that might be changing now. I understand others welcome this kind of change... but I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôll just be sulking in the corner. üòû

Game time is 7:30 so doors open by 6. To guarantee getting a bobble head you want to be there when doors open. You probably have until 7ish but after that your likelihood drops. 

STH here that has all the bobble heads since 2010. The most popular ones by far have been Zetterberg, Datsyuk, and Larkin. By popular I mean long lines of people at the door prior to opening. Just get there as close to opening as you can and you‚Äôll get one.

There is a significant number of motorcycle enthusiasts that are way more interested in aesthetics than comfort, protection, or practicality. It makes sense for newer riders because aesthetics are what they already know and it is readily accessible to them.

I‚Äôve reworded that section. My perspective is that the food at the Joe mostly sucked. Now the food at the LCA is mostly good and varied and worth checking out. Absolutely there are good food options in and around the city and I mention a couple plus a link to more. Everyone has their favorites and there are simply too many to list here. 
According to the [club seating guide at rateyourseats.com](https://www.rateyourseats.com/showratings/little-caesars-arena-hockey/club-and-premium-seating) there are no perks in the Mezzanine 3 section. The description of [Mezzanine 3](https://www.rateyourseats.com/sections/little-caesars-arena-hockey/Mezzanine3) says "Most of the Mezzanine sections behind the nets offer a unique Drink Rail ticket option at the top of the section. Fans should be aware however that views from the rail position will be limited." but this sounds like a separate ticket purchase. If you have more questions I recommend calling the ticket office to ask them directly.
According to their Facebook post on 2017-10-05, yes. https://www.facebook.com/AnchorBarDetroit/
Op, how many plots of land in Detroit have you bought for $1000? 
Yes but the skating waiver is behind the Red Wings Account Manager login. The waivers will also be at the LCA. 
I‚Äôm not shilling, just giving my own personal experience. I sell on StubHub and I see unsold tickets listed below face value but I also see them above face too. YMMV
My season tickets for comparable location cost *less* at the LCA than they did at the Joe. It is all relative my man/lady friend.
The ticket I sold on Stubhub for the 11/5/2017 game (section 211 row 3) went for US$29. Which of your organs is worth $29?
They put the info behind the Red Wings Account Manager login. I've posted it below for you and others. I'll be there tomorrow too!

Please Note: There will be no posed photographs during this time. 

**CONCESSIONS**

You will receive a voucher with $10 concessions credit when you arrive at Little Caesars Arena.

**LOCKER ROOM TOURS**

Locker room tours are available from 5:15 - 9:15 p.m., in 30-minute increments with groups of 200 per time slot.

A line for locker room tours will form outside PORTALS 18 and 19 (adjacent to the Budweiser Biergarten). The line for locker room tours will close at 8:45 p.m.

Tour Times: 

* Group 1 | 5:15 - 5:45 p.m.

**SKATING**

Ice skating is also available for guests. There will be a table on the street level concourse outside PORTALS 9 and 10 to pre-register to skate. You will be required to fill out a release form when you pre-register. Once this form is submitted, you will receive a wristband with your designated skating time. Ice skating will run in 20-minute increments with the Zamboni re-surfacing the ice every hour. There will be a maximum of 250 people per session, so be sure to pre-register early if you are interested in skating.

Please Note: A limited number of skates will be available to rent, but guests are encouraged to bring their own skates. Skate rental is complimentary, and a waiver is required to skate on the ice.

**MERCHANDISE**

Merchandise will be available for purchase at the main Team Store on the street level concourse near the Meijer Entry Southwest. 

Please Note: Guests who present their Open House tickets at the main Team Store during the event will receive a 10-percent discount on merchandise. Mobile tickets or printed tickets are accepted.

**HELPFUL HINTS**

1. Arrive early. Parking is available starting at 3 p.m., with Little Caesars Arena doors opening at 5 p.m.

2. There will be a scrolling list on the in-arena TVs, displaying where each player is stationed. If there is a specific player autograph you would like to receive, go to that line right away. This can limit the number of player stations you visit.

3. Sign up for your skating session upon arrival. Have your waiver filled out in advance.

4. You may have one item signed per player, per person.

5. Have items ready to be signed before reaching each player. This will keep the lines moving and get more people through each station.

6. Players will have black, silver & blue colored markers for signatures.

None of them work as well as bare skin. My solution: cut the tippy top off of the index finger on left hand. While I‚Äôm no longer ATGATT, I can now play Candy Crush in the curves. 
Upvote for Plugfones. I use the in conjunction with a Sena 10S. The stock 10S speakers aren‚Äôt loud enough for me to hear normal conversation with earplugs in over 60MPH in my helmet.

How‚Äôs Smitty working out for ya?
I‚Äôm not a professional hockey scout but I‚Äôve been watching the Red Wings for over 20 years. I‚Äôm surprised the professional scouts missed the fact that Smith starts seasons slow and cold and heats up over the season. Smith is also one of those players that finds another gear during playoffs. They got him hot. He had a hot playoff then signed him cold and are seeing the cold start. Patience, NYR. Regardless, the Armchair GM in me says Smith isn‚Äôt worth 4 million but that isn‚Äôt Smith‚Äôs fault. 
Design. Privacy. Simplicity. Reliability. 
You have several things operating on the 11/22 home game that are driving ticket prices up:

* new arena
* Canadian opponent
* Thanksgiving Eve (largest bar night in metro Detroit for locals and ex-pats home for the holiday)
* virtual Friday

These tickets were expensive at the Joe too.

If it is healthier for me to ignore toxic judgmental bullshit then I‚Äôm going to ignore it. They‚Äôll get the message and stop bugging you.

Remember this video was made *before* 2008-2009 when things in my opinion were at their worst in Detroit. It felt like we could do anything in the city and no one cared. We used to have a lot of fun back then, especially in the winter.
Occam‚Äôs Razor: start with the simple stuff as it is more likely. Do you have gas? Is the gas old? Replace if necessary. How old is the battery? Is it fully charged? Charge it if necessary. Take it to a battery or automotive supply store and they‚Äôll test it for free. Just because the lights come on doesn‚Äôt mean it has enough juice to start. Replace if necessary. 

Air filter, spark plugs, fuel pump, etc next. Take it to a mechanic if you‚Äôre not comfortable wrenching yourself. 
I‚Äôm going to sound rude but just know that while everything is new to you, you‚Äôre not the first person to stare down or go down this long path. Try searching for your question before posting and limit your ‚ÄúMy first ...‚Äù posts to 3 per month. Thanks and enjoy motorcycling!

Lower bowl is probably +90% STH. When I was given the chance to move there were very few seats available in the lower bowl. An empty seat can mean several things: unsold (unlikely), sold not attending, sold attending just not in seat when you looked (could be in bathroom, late, refreshment stand, restaurant, shopping, socializing, exploring). So long as the ticket is sold, what difference does it make if someone is sitting there when you are looking? Even at the Joe in the last season weekday meaningless games were sold out but appeared to have several empty seats. 
Why adjust the price of a ticket that is already sold?
Buy a ticket and there will be one less empty seat.

People are exploring the new stadium at the first games. Calm your tits. So long as the tickets are sold what do we care if a fan is sitting in their seat every minute of the event?

https://electrek.co/2017/10/18/zero-motorcycles-2018-lineup-new-fast-charging-range/
Who
There are more places to charge than there are gas stations. 
Why do you need a new battery every few years? You don‚Äôt need new batteries in electric cars every few years. 
Everything fails with time, including ICE motorcycles. 
With quick chargers you can recharge 80% in less than 20 minutes. When traveling by motorcycle when I stop for gas it takes me 20 minutes to pump, pay, piss, buy and eat a snack, smoke a cig, and chill. All of that can be done while waiting to charge in the same amount of time. Plus I can‚Äôt refuel my ICE bike at home or work. I have to take time to ride to a gas station. All in all I‚Äôm not sure it takes any longer to charge an electric bike. 
ICE engines never die or run out of gas.
You really have an axe to grind against electric motorcycles, don't you.
All the cars charging at work charge for free. Can't imagine why the motorcycle would be any different. Charging at home is less than $2 for a full tank of power. Not free but certainly less than the $25 it takes to fill up my ICE motorcycle.
Look at it this way: you‚Äôre buying your fuel up front.

I‚Äôve been to the Team Store at the LCA multiple times. Wasn‚Äôt aware they do jersey customizations. Where in the store do they do this?
They do jersey customizations at the LCA? Got a link to more details?

You might find a better deal at Detroit Athletic. 
* Boil it to remove slime. This reduces smell (not much), makes it easier to throw, and easier to pick up off the ice.

* Double bag it down your pants. You don‚Äôt want this leaking. 

* Do not through while the puck is in play or about to be in play. Best time to throw is after the anthems or during breaks in play at the end of the 3rd period. 

* Tradition was for good luck in the playoffs so you typically didn‚Äôt see one until the just before or at the start of the playoffs. Recently people want to do it when ever. 

* The best place to throw is from the lower bowl in the aisles beyond where the net stops a few rows up from the glass. Throw it further than you think you should. Don‚Äôt hit anyone!

* Have someone recording video and/or photos. 

* Don‚Äôt run away. Be cool. If you are detained by security you may be ticketed, fined, and escorted from the arena. Back at the Joe it ranged from ejection and fines to pat on the back. YMMV

Players park underground now. You can stand on the sidewalk and watch them drive down the ramp but I doubt you‚Äôll ever get an autograph this way. I never saw anyone get autographs of the players leaving or arriving at the Joe parking lot anyway. 

Best bets for autographs are advertised charity events, season ticket holder open house, and general open house.

For some unknown reason this sub doesn‚Äôt like negative opinions of the scoreboard or gondolas. I agree, rows 6 and above in the upper bowl behind the gondolas get their view of the scoreboard blocked but no one wants to hear it. I heard people bitching about it at preseason and the first home game. The consensus here appears to be ‚Äúshut up about it.‚Äù 
Unfortunately this AA situation looks like it will drag out for a couple more seasons. The uninformed opinions are already boring. Heck we still see Jurco and Pulkkinen threads and those two sucked. Sigh.

**Meh**

Cup holders are nice but the seats aren‚Äôt much better... certainly not wider or more leg room in the upper bowl. Retractable banners look fake compared to original real ones that are now at the practice rink.  Bathroom soap and paper towel dispensers need work. 

**Dislike**

Goal horn recording, acoustics, lack of view of entire stadium from each seat which leads to lack of unity among fans. Parking is a mess unless you drop $30-$40. 
Weekday Thursday night. 

Not well advertised/promoted. I didn‚Äôt get the red carpet details until Thursday morning. 

Concourse had a lot of people walking around exploring. 

I don‚Äôt think the acoustics are as loud as they think they are. Certainly quieter than the Joe. 

The intro presentation was meh. 

Ticket prices face value were high. I was shocked when I printed my upper bowl ticket and saw the face. Wow. 

All too bad because the game was very entertaining.

Car insurance companies are now saying that your USA proof of insurance is good enough now and you don‚Äôt need to carry the "Canada Non-Resident inter-Province Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Card". However I‚Äôve read that having the non-resident card has really helped in the event of an accident or being pulled over by police. Regardless, not having vehicle insurance in Canada can result in the vehicle being impounded until proof is provided. Will they check at the Canada and USA borders? Probably. My recommendation is to get vehicle insurance... for multiple reasons.

I posted this comment in the /r/detroitredwings threads on the horn topic. I wrote to my season ticket holder rep about the goal horn, here's their response:

> The goal horn!!!!!! There is something off about the goal horn and I did hear that it is a work in progress. The horn we have now is a recording of the horn from the Joe. We are not allowed to put the horn from the Joe into LCA because the horn from the Joe is from the 70s. I‚Äôm not sure what the technical words are for why they can‚Äôt bring it over but it is because the horn at the Joe uses a flammable gas that is against modern code. I guess the horn has a very flammable gas that it uses and it was only allowed to be at the Joe because it was grandfathered in, along with many other against code things at the Joe. Like I said though, the horn is a work in progress and hopefully they get that figured out soon, along with many other things. I know this is disappointing but I can tell you, they are doing everything they can to have a horn like the Joe, it is very important for everybody. 
I only buy ‚Äúhero‚Äù jerseys (e.g. Vladdy, Stevie, Lids, DMac, Z, Datsyuk) and right now there isn‚Äôt anyone on the team that is a hero (yet) that I don‚Äôt already own a jersey for. Hopefully this changes soon.

Best: at The Joe it was the $20 $5 hot-and-ready Little Caeser's pizza. That or the Hat Trick sub (Italian) from East End Joe's Deli. At the new LCA it will probably be the $25 $5 hot-and-ready Little Caeser's pizza. Or maybe fried chicken from the Coop. 

Worst: at The Joe it was the triple breaded nuclear hot yet still frozen inside "hot wings" from Red Hot Wings (ne√© Buffalo Wild Wings). At the LCA it will probably be the poutine with jalape√±os or anything from Kid Rock's place. Fuck that guy. 

Similar thing happened to me. I already knew how to ride but needed to get endorsed. Took MSF but couldn't get their rat bike into neutral. I knew it wasn't me.

Don't be afraid to ask for another bike if you know yours doesn't work well enough to complete the exercises.

In a day? If twisties then 300 is about the max before I get tired. Crushing? I've done a couple Iron Butts so 1,000 is doable but a long ride. Haven't done a Bun Burner or Bun Burner Gold yet so those see long to me too. 
This should be the top comment here and stickied to r/motorcycles forever. 
They won't tow you for paying to park at the casino. 
2017 is the first model year for the RNineT racer and sibling variants. To me they feel very much like one-offs. I wouldn't expect these RNineT variants to persist for very long in the BMW portfolio.

Yes, longer reach than most race replica sport bikes. Sat on one and in 5 seconds the odd angle of my back started to become uncomfortable. Can't imagine riding one for any distance. YMMV

Try unpairing with your phone, do a factory reset and a couple fault resets on the Sena, then repair with the phone and try again. 

I have found after multiple firmware updates that the Sena can act wonky until it is factory and fault reset. 
STH here, I've been using StubHub for years to sell unused tickets and (knock on wood) I've never had an issue. 
Re-signed for 1 year after multiple regular season healthy scratches and being healthy scratched for all 4 playoff games. Curious. 
Games Jurco did not play for the Chicago Blackhawks since 2017-02-24, assumed to be all healthy scratches where I was not able to find evidence of injury:

* 2017-03-12 (healthy scratch)
* 2017-03-14 
* 2017-03-16 (healthy scratch)
* 2017-03-23
* 2017-03-25
* 2017-03-31
* 2017-04-02 (healthy scratch)
* 2017-04-08
* 2017-04-13 (playoffs, healthy scratch)
* 2017-04-15 (playoffs, healthy scratch)
* 2017-04-17 (playoffs, healthy scratch)
* 2017-04-20 (playoffs, healthy scratch)
Not yet, but I have my pdfs. Last communication from my rep is they will come out mid September.

I don't see what you mean. These have the solid red base with no accents anywhere and white arm and bottom stripes. Looks like they kept the expected simple design elements. If anything they look more like the pre-Reebok Edge design the Wings had for nearly 20 years. Personally, I like it. 
Also, do you notice anything missing from the front wheel?

I disagree. Amazon HQ2 would bring a second wave of transplants. These wouldn't be hipsters but rather corporates... more like what the Detroit 3 used to bring in back in the 70s, 80s, and early 90s. They'll be educated, in stable relationships, with children, and more significantly with high expectations. They are ripe for the suburban resurgence and a massive spike in central and eastern northern lower Michigan waterfront property values. 

If you are looking to offload your early 00's South Lyon McMansion and Lake Huron generational family beach house... your potential payday is on the horizon.

It costs more than the sticker to operate a motorcycle. There is a total cost of ownership with any vehicle purchase e.g. insurance, registration, maintenance, gas, gear. If you can't afford all of it then you really can't afford any of it.

It's important to note you're inaccurate in your counting of Saturday home games for the Pistons. Even if you were accurate, what is your point?

Individual regular season tickets go on sale after STH get a crack at them. We haven't been notified yet. 
Correct, they cannot see the worlds largest seamless sports scoreboard and ceiling light array. I'm sure the monitors on the back of the gondola is a comparable experience. 
The season before last?
Don't care about that either. Let's talk about blocked views of the world's giantest scoreboard from seats behind the gondolas.

If true I feel for you. But your story sounds so implausible I'm inclined not to believe it. You're not angling for special treatment are you? 
You went through the logistics and expense of traveling 8,500 miles but couldn't be bothered to see if there was actually a show that night?
Guess where else they frown at 70 MPH wheelies.

This dude in front of me was weaving back and forth between lanes at a low speed. I went to pass him when a cop lit up so I pulled over to let the cop pass me thinking the cop was going after the erratic driver. Nope. The cop stopped behind me. He said my license plate light was out (it was). Didn't ask for my papers. Didn't get a ticket. He asked some dumb questions and made some dumb comments about BMW riders then left. Stood in my blind spot the whole time. Weird interaction. 
STH here who resells on StubHub. We haven't gotten our physical or PDF tickets yet for the 2017-2018 season. I won't put mine up for sale until I have them in my mitts. Individual regular season tickets aren't on sale yet. Right now you're just buying a promise on a reseller. 
The bar for Wings jersey retirement is pretty high. The last two were captains and had 3+ cups. I doubt the next jersey to be retired is on the team yet. 
Except I can buy a Zero DS today. 
Armchair GMs grind my gears. You've never managed a professional or amateur sport team. Your hindsight is 20/20. You don't know better just because you won the cup in NHL 17 on GM mode. Yes, you are entitled to your opinion like everyone else but stop acting like you would have done better.

Not a drop per se but a 0 mph fall. A derecho blew through with sustained wind 60+ mph and horizontal rain. I watched from behind an office window in horror as my R was blown over by the wind. The R bounced on the cylinder head. No damage except scratches on the head. Wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it for myself.

People have different ratings for ranking bikes. Bikes that are Iron Butt rally finishers are interesting to me. What do these maniacs chose to ride to complete such a demanding event where reliability and comfort are paramount. [In 2017 there was not a single KTM among them.](http://ibr.wvi.com/ibr/_2017/finalstandings.pdf) The dominate models were GS and FJR. 
As an aged-out former skate punk I am insanely jealous. I hope you kids appreciate what you're getting!
Two meh teams but evenly matched, exciting moments to the game, crowd wasn't as energetic as the Big House games but those were higher profile teams. For a Wednesday night casual soccer fan I had a good time. Tickets were a little pricey but for the novelty it wasn't painful. I'd do it again.

Ok, why the Flint jabs? I don't get the connection. It's a different city in a different part of the state that has nothing to do with the Red Wings.
