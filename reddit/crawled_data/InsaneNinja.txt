From that assortment of tweets, it looks like audio only? Or only when he requested multi-speaker
Because it’s resource production and not just food. Doubling the amount of food currently on earth just adds a surplus measured in months. 
Apartments, features, extra abilities beyond  on and off. Some include infrared as a color, which is good for night cameras. 
Would an android TV device solve this? Or even some raspberry pi setup that whitelists?

CC’s are bad for dorms/offices. 
That is for allowing people who aren’t even on your Wifi network that also have access. 
They (earth) are a lot closer to space travel now than they were when there was 3.5 billion the first time. Gives earth some breathing room so there isn’t a rush to spread out just for land grabs. 
In GOTJ 1’s prison scene, Star Lord is shown to be wearing a universal translator implant. It’s assumed that most people speaking have one as well. 

Language barriers are already being overcome here now with our lame tech compared to what they have access to. 
Forests is in like three other books. Including a short story collaboration called “dangerous women”. 
Multiple devices. If you login one, it logs out another. I like viewing public stories on the iPad. 
I think I misunderstood your original point and we are on the same side. 
It is a thing, but you need a cord the first time, to turn it on. 
Android already had that idea.

The current arrangement serves 90% of the people that buy iPhones. Putting a USB-C cord in the box would fuck over a lot of people who now need to buy USB-A cables. 

Unless you want a C dock port. That’s an entirely different discussion. We all want that. 

And the pixel and S9 are shipped with a USB-A to C cable.   So you couldn’t connect those to MacBooks either. 
MacBooks have nothing to do with the majority of their customer base.
Those countries don’t generally buy MacBooks. 
… no. 

Cords = advanced.    
Wireless sync = everymans.    

Sync is enabled by default.   
Again, this is my view of their opinion. 
They think that the phone cord is just a power cable for most users.  
I look at wrist devices a lot. About 40% of the watches I see ARE Apple Watches. Waiters, 7/11, casual encounters, and even at tollbooths. It already is mainstream. 

I called the early devices they make “practice“. Such as the first three iPads, and the first three phones. And especially the first watch. 
No part of this was a question. The entire post and comments are statements of opinion and conjecture. Even the part about android. 
That’s what the manufacturer rumor mill is claiming.
It’s simple to understand if you go on the basis that they now consider connecting your phone to your laptop to be an advanced user’s feature. That the cord they ship is meant to be for charging, even if it also syncs. 

I am not saying this is a good thing. But it’s what they have in mind. 
I thought they changed that. That iCloud restores include your login states. Although most of this is negated by iCloud keychain and app passwords. 

For many apps, you can manually add passwords in keychain. At the bottom of the keychain screen you just add a URL like “snapchat.com” despite that there is no logon for their page. 
When a back up is restored on to a new device, the back up then becomes associated with that new device. The old device will have to perform a new back up. 

At least that’s how I believe it works. 
Make sure both sides of your connector are cleanly usable. Then call yourself a few times, iPad to phone (or iPad to MacBook if you have one).   
Plug in before the call or after the call is connected.   
See if the cord being tugged lightly causes it to start up.  
See if you can narrow down the situation that way. 

Later, ask her to point out immediately when it starts so you can review your actions.   


Or buy new earbuds… or AirPods. 

If it matters, you can do that with most routers now. 
If I airdrop/handoff a Reddit/YouTube url to a blank iphone, it opens the link directly. But if the app is already installed, it opens in that app.

I want it to work this way on Apple TV.  And developers would very much want their apps to be used more often.

All of that code is already there.. and that’s how it should work. It could do the very same thing with Apple Music.
I’m thinking it’s not the tightness, it’s where the “sport band” tip tucks under the band, becoming an internal bump.. Especially now that I see where this nerve’s placement is. I didn’t always wear default sports bands. 

But I shall deal with the needed change in my habits. 
Apple has been doing this for years if you airplay an iTunes Store movie to Apple TV.  The ATV streams it from the store instead.   
Just need to turn this into an api and continue displaying the controls on the phone. 
 I don’t know if you can wipe your number from their friend finding. 

You can change your instagram name after the fact. Changing your current account to something else and then making a new one under the “old” name.  It’s what I did when changing usernames a few months ago, retaining the old name. 
Your number is in their uploaded contact lists. 

So they are finding you by scanning their own contacts, and Instagram is “helping you” by showing you people that know you. 

You need to use a number that they don’t have. Perhaps a new Google voice number?
One version required you click the episode, and then a play button appeared. That’s been eliminated now. 
Steve said that if you want to watch porn, get an android phone. 
Sounds like they backed themselves into a thermal corner. 
One thing that people don’t mention while talking about Chromecast…

-YouTube on my iPhone, playing a video.    
-Click cast, display on tv.     
-Force close the iPhone YouTube app and the video continues to play on tv (step is not needed).   
-open YouTube on my iPad, click cast without playing a video, and it activates as a remote for the currently casting video.   
-click cast button to disable.. it is now playing on my iPad, on the same running timeline as was started on my phone. 

This is what handoff for iOS should be like, except where you can pick up the next device and pull the playing video from your other device. 

Video playing on my iPhone? I now want it on my iPad. 

Movie on my iPhone? Play it on my tv. Don’t restrict what my phone can now do for the entire length of the movie. 

Airplay should send the stream source, not just share the media. 
How customizable is the LED light. Like what range of colors?  I’m not asking for 16 million, so even 8 would be nice. It is just that they don’t describe it at all on their website. 

I’m trying to see if IFTTT can make it blink as well. 
HomeKit products use more power because of reasons. One of which is probably how easy it is to view out of the camera. Starting it up regularly. 
Most tv smart features are really tedious. I gladly shut off Wifi to my tv and just hooked a CC and ATV to the back of it. 
The wake word is heard locally. Only that will trigger actual internet access. 
That feature is provided by a fingerprint database that the pixel has on hand of about 10,000 songs. All ranging around your tastes and popularity charts for your area. It’s accomplished even without internet access. 
Because it’s behind the times. 

They made airport so there’s a good router on the market. 

Now there’s lots of them, better than apple’s. 
I think Apple is relying on them to identify themselves cleanly. 
Have you uninstalled news from the phone and then reinstalled it? Preferably with a reset in between. 
It’s not a camera. It’s a camera shutter. They’re showing that with the icon. 
And yet I’d never switch back to a button phone. 
It hasn’t been updated for iPhone X yet. Inbox is super slow, and with letterboxing... while the gmail app is one of the smoothest running apps Google puts out.
It’s so frustrating that the only reason I haven’t deleted it yet is because there’s no “purchases” feed in gmail.app.
It hasn’t been updated for iPhone X yet. Inbox is still slow with letterboxing, while the gmail app is one of the smoothest running apps Google puts out.  

It’s so frustrating that the only reason I haven’t deleted it yet is because there’s no “purchases” feed in gmail.app. 
You think they haven’t got a team on it by now?  Apple tries all the things. I pushed it to 12.1 for the extra time. I was taking about the feature, as just a hard thing for Apple to advertise as a big feature. Because it’s already something their texting app already does. 

On android it’s like “texting is no longer horrible! It works over Wifi and does typing indicators and group chat! Sometimes!”

But for Apple, the keynote message is “You know that thing we solved for iOS to iOS over half a decade ago? Green bubble people are finally catching up, so this update does it for everyone else too! Depending on who they’re using! You won’t even notice!”
I saw connected relays. Something that extends the Bluetooth via Wifi. Some brands make their own, but I think there is one that does that for any brand. I don’t know what it would be named. 
I always felt sorry for the chicken. 
I mean as cheap as the old storage. Once you replace the old production with the new production, it becomes cost-effective
“Bluetooth is garbage and you cannot connected via Wi-Fi to HomeKit”

If it’s close enough to an Apple TV, it can connect just fine via Bluetooth. 
This is also a first of its kind
They will only “force” it if it becomes cheaper to produce. 
The newer ones only come in 64 and 256.  
Apple designs a fair number of their own parts and has them produced. This includes their main chip, and many others. They also designed the tech in their screen. 

The Apple Watch is nearly 100% custom, while android wear devices use a modded version of the same chip that was in the Moto X. (Droid X?). 

The pixel hardware is 97% “I’ll have what he’s having” and a custom camera chip. Which is not bad, making it easier for them to get out the door. It is fairly overpriced when compared to other flagships though. It doesn’t push hardware forward at all.


https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/6fkzw5/feature_using_the_back_button_in_safari_closes/

It is mimicking the way macos safari worked before it. 
It’s a Unix system.. I know this!
So by Google designed, you mean a general assortment of off the shelf parts and a good camera? Because very little of the phone is only in that phone. 
It keeps going into the betas and getting removed. It’s probably pretty difficult to do your first synced E2E system and not fuck it up. Especially when it will be half a billion devices using it by default. (Okay, not even that cuz it will likely need iCloud storage). 

I don’t think they’re holding back on it. But that’s server coding. RCS is only a heavily modded implementation of mms interface. 
Maybe that’s something P can get from iOS. They’ve got back gestures down now, especially with the X. 

With this new pill gesture, the back button can be specifically in-app only. 
Double tap on the app switcher button. I believe that’s the solution. 
It’s taller than the one on the X, and it’s handled just fine on that phone.  Apple has the whole bottom of the phone as a sliding area, even if you’re resting closer to the edge. Momentum is also taken into account, making it functional almost up to the right corner. 
Bad gestures are bad. Ones that act like you expect them to (aka intuitive) are more useful than you expect. And sliding left right on the pill is amazingly useful on the X I work with. 

It’s like pinch to zoom. One of those things you get right and it just makes any other gesture for that seem like a horrible idea. 
Flickr was suffering heavily under yahoo. The fact that they had a shit app even after instagram got big is a total failure of management. 
Time to try out some more music. 
Repeat steps 4-7 at will. 
That’s easily a simple 12.1 update. There’s no usability overhaul. iMessage does everything that RCS does. All the UI/IX is already developed. They barely need to announce anything except to say how they saved SMS from the dark ages. 
RCS?  I have no suggestions there. That’s just less broken texting. I didn’t notice but hopefully it works over Wifi without relay tricks. 

I’m sure I’d have suggestions for Google messenger. The first one would be to completely kill duo/allo and merge it in as a simple call button on the interface. All texting preferring the data method first (allo servers?). 

Then release “Google messenger” for iOS that does everything but sms. 

This would act exactly how iMessage/FaceTime does on an iPad. 

All of this combined is exactly how it would work If Apple put iMessage on android. 


Apple forced visual voicemail down carrier’s dev pipelines. They can add RCS and let iOS sense the carrier capabilities. Then embarrass carriers by bringing it up in a keynote. 

Definitely not till iOS 12 though, because of how they function. They’re in the waning days of 11 and only doing minute upgrades until then. 
Flickr is now small enough. 
If RCS is adopted, it can’t be dropped. Especially if Apple picks it up. That’s like dropping MMS. 

This whole arrangement allows Google to not bother working the backend, while still making the apps that scrape the metadata via your keyboard and other suggestions. 

They don’t OWN email. They just make the interface.  Same with RCS. 
Why build a sub sub network that only works on one OS between super geeks when the same system already exists elsewhere. You can’t even use an encrypted RCS app on iOS. 

What you’re talking about would only exist as a proof of concept by people who hate businesses. 
Google doesn’t give half a shit about E2E. Allo isn’t E2E unless you run it in a mode that breaks everything. 
Yes. Let’s start another standards war!

RCS is data. All of this already exists in existing apps. And those work across existing OSs 
Apple adding it… that’d do to RCS what they did for mobile payments. Half a billion capable devices overnight, and you don’t have to tell mom to go install something from the play store. 

The main difference parental types would see is all those “1of2” messages going away. 
There’s no reason they wouldn’t implement it. iMessage still has tons of other features (like privacy and security). 

The difference is they wouldn’t even really have to tell anyone. It could be like iOS 12.1.2. They already have all they need in graphics. 
If I had a black light... that place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting. 
It’s possible if you have your old phone. 
They do play ball. Google can put any messenger it wants in the App Store and put their full weight behind it. But Google keeps changing the color/size of the ball and nobody knows what to use. There are at least 7 Google apps I can install on my X to say “hi” 1on1 in various ways.

What you’d be asking is for Apple to make a ball and say “it’s this one, you wishywashy flake”. 

Apple will do to RCS what they did to mobile payment adoption. Because in one day, half a billion users will suddenly have the capability. They won’t even have to change the graphics they use, it’ll all just carry over and suddenly be less annoying. Like “iOS 12.1 : adds support for RCS”. 
I stick around because of the shitshow it is managing Google Photos on a laptop. iMessage is no big deal to me except in extreme cases of wanting to send an OG image. 

Doing any metadata searching or smart folders is impossible in Google Photos. Oh great I can find a damn cat sitting in snow... but try to do something useful and it’s got nothing for me unless I was stringent about making albums on upload. 
That’s a tad dramatic. 

I didn’t know this was 9th grade again. 
It’s only a steady pattern for the past six years at most, because you can only count the already-discontinued early phones. Your table only includes the idea of pre-planning their deaths, and not just them actually testing the device and finding it lacking. 
Same. The main reason I have narwhal around. 
That makes no sense. Everyone will get RCS at a minimum. Apple wouldn’t cripple their own users by sticking to sms, because that would be a reason to leave iOS. They probably already have it working in development, waiting for it to have actual carrier support, and not the broken mess it is now. Google might be able to say “hey this exists” but Apple can say “and you’re fucking supporting it”. 

After that.. iMessage users get the full power of the App Store between them. Which is a setup where mutual devices can display things perfectly between users.   
Blue bubbles will mean it looks how you intended, and has security, privacy, and extra features. 
Also end-to-end encryption and security. 
Hotspot peaks out at like 15gb. Maybe if it was four times that.. 
They’re working the oceans now. Villager updates was Last time when they added illagers and spooky mansions. 
The current betas are full of TONS of water updates. Including water zombies and dolphins.

With Google home, it sends the request to Google, Google talks to the cloud components of your devices, and the cloud components tell their devices to do the action. 

With Apple iOS, it sends directly to the devices over Wifi or Bluetooth. 

This is why homekit commands are faster than anything Google/IFTTT can do. As well as allowing for BluetoothLE-only devices such as from Eve. The latest amazon tubes have built-in Z-wave and so are speedy as well. 

In your case, it sends from your phone, to Apple. Apple relays the instruction by sending those commands out from the Apple TV, iPad, HomePod, using their Bluetooth/Wifi communications. 
Because whoever coded that page uses YouTube music or Spotify.
Non-OP’s...

I’m doing $105 for my old 450mins, unlimited data,  GF plan.... as well as $30 for my iPad OG plan on my iPad Pro. 

I regularly do between 25 and 60 gigs a month on both every month because I travel a lot. I might just click and download an audiobook at any point, or be stuck watching YouTube for an hour or four at 1080P.

I have this feeling that if I change my plans, they will be able to mess with me in the future due to things they have hidden in the current contracts.

Thoughts?

Edit: Apparently my phone’s 3 month average is 78GB, with a peak of 98.7GB. 
Have a Facebook app that doesn’t get all your data from other sites. Stay logged out in your main browser.

Have a work browser if you have to login with one for tasks.

Have a few icon links for the little kids to view their favorite sites, while denying access to the real browser.

It’s all about customization and imagination. Not battery and performance.
That’s his fault for using iOS chrome. Google codes it’s apps to keep you in its apps. Chrome clings hardest of all.

“There are two notable changes in this update. First is the removal of the stereo pairing option for HomePod that we saw in beta 1. Whether the feature was removed ahead of an official launch alongside HomePod firmware or due to problems is unknown at this time. “
So they only removed stereo pairing?
They removed it again from beta 2. Not that I’ve used it. 
Many laptops don’t bother with having buttons.

They changed a fundamental feature of off-screens. “I squeeze my phone and the finger print thing isn’t working anymore”. But you buy a new phone and it’s there day one. 

This might be an accessibility thing too. People with muscle control problems accidentally locking their phone. 
No, it means he has an 8/X
That’s only on the 8/X. Yes for real. 
I’d say on my current set of earbuds, I was annoyed to get only an hour and a half last week when I was using only one Airpod. 

But to be honest, these are little batteries that are often charged, and basically don’t allow us to follow any of the battery life habit suggestions we talk eachother into following. 

For such little batteries… Your experience isn’t surprising at all. You’ve kept yours in your possession longer than I have. 

I would either get some refurbished ones, or get the little individual headphones which are $60 apiece for replacements. Or just wait for AirPods v2 like I am. Or… go right up to Apple and very nicely ask if there’s something that can be done. “I love them but I’m not thrilled with them degrading so quick” 
It’s the Winchester again, isn’t it. 
This will be the next thing that some school will require in all classes. 
They were selling this for much cheaper right up front. Though I had a few Wemo items from before homekit was feasible, so it was a must have. Homebridge can do the same as this item. 

Wemo Bridge - Works with Apple HomeKit https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076J5MDYS/
I can actually do the second one with homebridge and the advanced homekit rule conditions in the eve app. 

“Weather condition category” = 1 means cloudy. So I can tell the eve app to set a homekit rule that triggers at sunset with the condition of cloudy. 

Without homebridge, you could just use a hue motion sensor which senses light levels, pointed outside. And set a rule that the porch light is completely dependent on sensed light levels during certain hours. 
The way the x works, I slide up on my screen as I’m pulling it up towards my face, and it authenticates as soon as it sees me. It gives a bit of lead time in between. 

So the “by the time I pulled it out of my pocket” argument isn’t really a big deal unless looking at your phone isn’t involved in the process.

So the “by the time I pulled it out of my pocket” argument isn’t really a big deal unless looking at your phone isn’t involved in the process. 
Because they are better security? or because they let you in easier?
I’d say less than 5% of European/American android phone owners understand that their phones can be rooted, with much less having actually done it themselves. 
They’re smarter than that, unless maybe you only authenticate with maybe your ring finger on your left hand, or the tip of your dick. 
It’s the power down screen, and It has a descriptive disclaimer. It’s basically the same gesture as squeezing your phone in a full grip, which you can do if your screen is smashed in a car accident. 

And iPhone owners point it out to their iPhone owning parents because it’s a feel good feature. 
The watch has the same gesture. 
They won’t really use the code. They would be using the designers to add a few more intelligent automations into iOS. 

And they can give that app a lot more access since they know it won’t become shady.
As much as you need. I’ve seen huuuuge mana batteries of a whole chunk, 16x16 full. It was glorious particle effects when crafting was made. 

Use comparators on the generating pools to shut off your production when it gets near full. 
No. Alien blue pro gave me 3 years of gold. 
Are they all from the phone itself or are they camera raw files?
A prime example of history being rewritten to suit someone’s needs. 
More or higher tier generation. Put 2 munchdew near your tree farm. Or do the cake one. The explosion one. Etc. All at the same time. 
Make a mana battery (a 3x3 or larger) all with sparks that the plate's spark can pull from. It's a good start. Not like you're crafting a hundred ingots. 
I regret that I have but one downvote to give for my country.

On my honor, her honor. On his honor. That book series started great but became a form of self punishment at 60% through. Especially after the 775th time he explained why their points of view were why they were. 

I really tried. I own most of the series but can't touch it now. 
16 months at least. 
I'd like to really suggest 14 by Peter Clines. 
Amazing reader, (Ray Porter) and a story that draws you in. 

A man moves into a new apartment.. and starts noticing weird things.. enlisting others to help to find things out. It gets a lot bigger than it sounds. 

It's 12 hours, so running at 1.25x should bring it pretty close to what you need. 
As mentioned, Scalzi's Lock-In series has two releases of each of its 2 books. 

The male versions read by Wil Wheaton. The other two by Amber Benson.  Four different purchases. 
They aren't talentless hacks. They are humans running machines and just need better machines. 

Apple can front the money for the machines in a way that's super profitable for both sides. Especially if they become a long term manufacturing partner. 

Having Apple on their ass for quality control will just step up LG's game. 
Google play services, the play store, and their data mining systems subsidize the free versions of android as well. They aren't doing it as charity. 

Allowing custom small time copies of totally free android to exist is just taking a hit as a form of brand loyalty. It's rare compared to the money making version.

I think it's more like Da Vinci telling painters how to paint his house. What colors to use, what standards to live up to, and how to get the best use out of the brushes. Making them do a far better job than they'd normally be capable of. 
Apple designed the technology of the X's OLED screen. That's why it still tests more color-accurate than the S9 screen. 

Again, Samsung manufactured, but did not design the iPhone OLED screen. 

And on top of that…   
>	The result: Apple has produced an impressive Smartphone display with excellent performance and accuracy, which we cover in extensive detail below. What makes the iPhone X the Best Smartphone Display is the impressive Precision Display Calibration Apple developed, which transforms the OLED hardware into a superbly accurate, high performance, and gorgeous display, with close to Text Book Perfect Calibration and Performance!!

http://www.displaymate.com/iPhoneX_ShootOut_1a.htm

Apple would pre-pay for the screens, which includes the costs of altering/creating the machines to manufacture them. Something they often do. 
Google subsidizes the cost of the OS development by selling you. So Samsung doesn't have to pay for full OS developers. 

Apple adds the cost of software development to the device because they don't sell you. 

That's what the guy means. Samsung is getting a break that Apple isn't getting. 
Apple designs their screens. They would tell LG how to make them. Then test/calibrate every single screen. 

Google ordered the pixel screens and then batch tested them. 

World of difference. 
The screws they have no excuse for.   

But as for the rest, when it comes to their top tier phones, there's no such thing as standardized parts. Their OLED tech was measured as best in class. They have two batteries in it.. and the entire face scanning system was brand new to the market. Everything is custom. 

The laptops are designed from scratch to be so small. None of the directly competing laptops run much of standardized parts either. 
It’s like that old joke about their design philosophies. 

Apple: we won’t let you do that because it’s stupid. 

Google: we’ll let you do that even if it’s stupid. 
1Blocker has no subscription. Just a 1 time payment to unlock access to all features.

Yo dawg, we heard you like messaging. So we put messaging in your mail messages, so you can message them to check their new message. 
Inbox for gmail for iOS received all of its current features in the initial release, and the 27 updates following that are all listed as bug fixes. 

It still doesn’t display fullscreen on iPhone X, while nearly all other Google apps currently do. It’s slow to render, custom nonstandard gestures, while the gmail app is waaay faster than inbox. Buttery smooth compared to laggy mclagface. 

I keep the app around for one reason, the “purchased” tab. 
What if a pickpocket just picks up your phone right next to you, swipes it open, and walks away with the screen up. 

That’s horrible security.  That’s like android level stupid. (They actually do that.)
They made every version of every feature harder to use.

Chat and direct image sharing stayed the same as it ever was.. The redesign condensed two friend list screens into one, while removing any form of sorting or organization. This, while moving all your more useful follow feeds into the ad\-filled screen nobody checks anymore, killing many popular snap poster's visibility.

I seriously do not see any form of organization in the feed whatsoever.. not time, nor how often i message people. 20hr and 20min are blended together. Names without stories appear above people with stories closer to the bottom of the list… And its harder to tell which of them have sent you messages because the icons are smaller. 
He boomed them at faces. 
Is your default music source set to YouTube music? Or Google music?
… that’s why all the mainstream apps removed themselves. 

Deadlines are coming up. Requirements to be on the latest SDKs, with watchOS 2 for minor updates to apps, and watchOS 4 for all new apps. 
Maybe they’re doing okay with chats. But they’ve basically gutted the visibility of popular stories, and the ability to do something as simple as see what’s new. 
OC’s is “smart” because it identifies silences and tries specifically to jump between words instead of back a couple seconds in general.

You can’t use the Watch without a link to an iPhone. To install an app on the watch, it has to be installed on the phone.  You can’t do this with an iPad or anything else. 

This includes the cellular watch.

Get an android wear OS watch. 
You can’t hook the watch to a computer. That negates just about everything to do with jailbreaking the watch. 
Corporate: That problem will solve itself in time. 
Because the post is about the activity app. Which only works with the watch. 
Updating an icon with the time, and updating the icon to match a synced device.… that’s a hell of a difference in battery usage. 
I believe that that’s what page 2 should look like. Page 1 should be “every day“ apps without folders. 

That’s my personal preference. 
They won’t hot fix a six-year-old problem. They are offloading it to a whole new system.

Apple produces five year phones.   
Android produces two-three year phones. 

I think Apple is trying to see what happens to the iPhone X OLED long term first. It’s not like it’s hurting sales.
This is absolutely a third-party area of features. First party apps are for the 90% of people
It’s for children. 

Otherwise DND and the favorites list works fine. 
Google the US “Cloud Act” which got snuck in with the latest budget. It removes the need for warrants, as well as including it in treaties. 

News about it is extremely suppressed. 
Supposedly iOS 11.4 will finally enable iMessage sync. macOS will probably release similar update at the same time. 

This should kill that bug completely. 

But, every other version had this feature in the beta as well. They keep pulling it because it’s not finished.
Are you using iMessage. Or just ginormous files?

You may be working with iMessage turned off… Since macs can send over SMS now using the phone as a relay. 
Most first party iOS buttons have secondary effects if you hold it longer. Especially in safari. Even the reload/back/new tab buttons. 

Third-party apps try to make everything visible. 
Apple likes to make advanced functions accessible, even if not visible. Out of the way for people not quite advanced enough to use them.


It’s not people who waited for red.  It’s put out for people who blew off updating, to have a possible excuse to finally jump in. 

Also, a big cut of the device goes to charity. They’d rather wait until the surge dies down. 
They probably look a little better in person. Give trust to the people that designed the pretty shit.
Odd man out…? the iPhone seven was gold, rose gold, silver, and two shades of black, THEN added red. 


If you buy annually, then you won’t care about the mid-year devices. 
Put one million monkeys in a room pecking at typewriters, add karma rankings = Shakespear. 
You’re not going to see a difference. It’s running those videos at their native frame rate to the tv, as opposed to the old way of upconverting everything to 60fps. 


If your video was 30fps it would double every frame.   
If 24fps it would double and then blend a few frames in between.   
What they’re doing now is not an “improvement” as much as it is just running them with less conversion. 

Native 48fps/60fps are those ultra smooth movies that just don’t look right. But the main interface is run at 60fps because we are used to digital interfaces (iOS) that run at high frame rate. Hell, the new iPad pros run at 120fps and look buttery smooth at fast movement. 
Don’t put raw files in Google Photos.

It’s not proprietary. USB-C to USB-B micro would be universal. 
Nope. DAC in the dongle. And it works on all models of iPhone/iPads with lightning ports, back to the iPhone 5. 

Same with the lightning earbuds they ship with every phone and sell for… $20USD? 25?

https://ifixit.org/blog/8448/apple-audio-adapter-teardown/
I never meant exclusive. 
He is referring to how the phone can output power and function as the charger for the earbuds. 
And they sell an 8 dollar lightning adapter, at all major retailers, that doesn’t break. Step it up Google. 

Google needs to make a deal with someone like belkin to make a good dongle that requires them to be sold at all stores. 
Apple sells theirs for 8 dollars. And they’re actually reliable. 

Wtf third party people. 
When the book was over and the battle was won.. I felt like “okay now where does the story start”.  I didn’t realize the whole book wasn’t about progressing the story. It’s just a training session that went weird and needed cleaning up.

I’m running the final public beta. 

And as it did before with 11.0, it’s wanting me to download the full 2GB OTA 11.3 update. I’m just ignoring it until bed sometime because it’ll take a while. 
Actually it does, because beta 6 still has iCloud iMessage in settings. 
He should also see if Bluetooth is on on those devices. 
This happens when you repeatedly click to expand a comment before it loaded the sub comment information from the web. 

It makes a duplicate subcomment with both click triggers affecting the one true subcomment. 

If you’re fast enough, you can duplicate it multiple times before it loads the data. 
It is totally E2E. 
After it was sent, that no longer counts. The E2E part is over. 
Currently your account tells your friend how many devices you have. Your text is encrypted separately to each device’s “public” key, and a message is sent to each one of them, as well as each of your own. It sits in a queue waiting to be received and unencrypted by only that (each) device. 

With the new system.. if you sell all your Apple devices, and then buy a new device, it downloads all your past messages. Explain to me how that’s E2EE. It’s just E. 
If you can download your history of iMessages to a new device... That’s exactly the opposite of E2E between devices. 
Nope. These new rules are “make the apps run on their own”. And the app devs respond “update our watch apps? We’ll just delete them instead”. 

And that’s where we are. The Cellular Watch is what’s killing these already-abandonware apps. 
You can’t because iMessage is still currently end-to-end encrypted. 

This is a feature I will not use because it removes E2E and makes it server based like Facebook messenger. 
That applies to everything else in this post. 

But for dinosaurs, we know what they looked like, just not pigments. 
To deal with people like yourself. 
Is that a technical limitation or a speed thing on 4k? Pretty sure the 2020 iPad processors would handle it easily. 
Not in the next half a decade or so. Probably the MacBook for two years before they attempt it in the MacBook Pro. 
iCloud devices share preferences. 

Third party android apps give full functionality. 
Bad security is a major reason this happens.

Also worth checking that your watch and iOS are both up to date.. they've modded a lot about watch music lately.
Computer image recognition is improving as fast as our processors improve. In the next ten years we'll make as much progress as in the past 30.. Thats how this works.

Every repaired mistake will never be a mistake again. Tesla's have auto update and never make the same (big) mistake twice.
Public Roads, not true.

Mostly unharmed. They still had radiation reactions. It's the reason we dont have many moon trips now. OSHA style tolerances have gone up.

Better drivers in 10? Yes. Affordable tech, not so much.
It would only take a year or two for it to see every single junction. Especially if they sent out a few cars for unmapped areas. Google's already done it themselves.

Thats also how the Waze app got most of it's data. It started as a pacman game for roads undriven. 
It sounds like you’re not streaming from Apple Music. You’re streaming from your phone and expecting that to work over the internet. 


No, you do not stream from your phone over the internet to the watch. Music app is the app on your phone that holds music. 
“Apple Music” is a subscription service where you’re paying Apple a monthly fee to access all the music, and streaming it directly from Apple, just like Spotify.

The other (original) options are to load a playlist into the watch, or stream from your phone over Bluetooth. Possibly also Wifi on the SAME Wifi network, which may or may not work depending on public WiFi privacy settings. (It won’t work over hotel Wifi)
On day one the price will go down.

Today. Depending on what game you want to play. 

But giving the benefit of the doubt that they’re currently “mobile” VR games... iPhones have better GPUs and could run them better. 
Why do you think android phones are better at VR?  It’s primarily pixel density. 
The iPhone X has their wanted higher density, and iOS easily maps to higher pixel counts. So the XI+ will far more likely just have a different cut of the same screen, as opposed to a 3.5x resolution. 
You offer a reason Apple is behind in resolution. 

They cal 3X “Super Retina”. So how long before they hit 4X..?

That can be blamed on just the battery needing swapped if they still existed. 
They’re both 326.  It still is ridiculous on apple’s part that they have the same resolution  for so long on their flagship phones. 

The plus phones are 401, and the X is 458.  This while android phones are in the 500s or higher. 
Wait... I thought the A9 was the dual/dual core, and the A10 was the dual/quad core that could use all of its little+big processors at once. 

That’s why it was the A10 Fusion Processor. 

Edit: Nevermind, I’m wrong. Apparently. It went from dual/dual A10 to quad/six core A11
The 6S isn’t slow for reasons of age. It’d be throttling or just a rare runaway memory bug that’s squashed by a reinstall & restore of backup. I say rare because most people have never needed to do that, even if redditors suggest it often as unplugging and plugging it back in. 

If it’s slow on 11.3, something fixable is wrong. 
They explained it badly. Auto fill is now available in safari web view in apps. 

Such as if you click a link in Instagram or FB messenger and that shitty non standard browser pops up. 
They were all teaching each other how to do it, or else constantly explaining how it felt. That wasn’t typical on planet Vegeta with the constant competition for power. 

Just like how Vegeta trained the alternative universe Saiyans. The best fighters are usually least likely to be trying to help the others grow to compete. 

The kids got it because they grew up in it. Like little kids and electronics now. 
No. It’s the “Apple finally invented a black cord!” mentality. 

Which costs more than ones made by other companies.... and costs more than the white version. 
Google has no plan. That’s the problem. They just have a bunch of teams that each have good ideas. 

The reason is that Google doesn’t give people assignments, they let them pick their own job at the company. Everybody wants to make version one, and other people want to overhaul something and make version two. But nobody wants to make version three.
Because they have to update the watch app or else they can’t submit app updates. Simple. 

Besides, who really would use pandora on LTE on the watch. Do you hate your battery that much?

No. A lot of features go missing if you add a green text to a group messaging chat. It sets everyone to MMS-only in that chat. 

An iMessage group chat, or even solo chat, has about as many features as Facebook messenger or WhatsApp. Including leaving or joining the group.

A Published Folder would be my suggestion. 

Windows? Set Lightroom to generate a folder of “color:green” or 4-5star or whatever your method is, possibly in a location indexed by windows photos or other such systems.   

On MacOS I export to /User/Pictures/Exports/ and auto open in Photos.app upon export completion. The program Hazel deletes any file in /Exports that’s more than a week since file creation. 
If you want to color pixels then Lightroom is fine. If you want to move pixels then photoshop is better. 

They’re designed to work together. 
>	“We saw the implementation [of gestures] on the iPhone,” admits Pei, and “maybe it would have taken longer if Apple hadn’t done it.” He has the same answer when I ask him whether OnePlus would have done a notch design had it not been for the iPhone X: “Maybe not as fast. But we have access to the roadmaps of all the screen manufacturers, and when they gave us the opportunity to make cutouts at the top of the screen, it just made sense.” OnePlus agrees with the widely held view that Apple “accelerates the adoption of things within the industry,” adding the subtle caveat of “where it makes sense.”

At least they admit it, unlike other companies. 
I use safari. I feel fine about what I expect from it. 
The main difference between A9 and A10 is the core usage. 

A9 has two small cores and two big ones. Switching to whichever pair it needs at the moment. Making it a functional dual core. 

A10 uses the two small ones 100% of the time and then has the two big beefy ones for any times it needs even more performance. Making it a quad core when under stress.   
So yes, it handles stress better. 

Additionally... A11 has four small cores running full time, and two powerful ones.

Speed boost and better AR support. New battery, newer cameras, and software updates up into the 2020s. 
The iPad 3 is… wow. You should look into a refurb of anything newer. Aren’t you still on a 30pin connector and iOS 9? How’s the battery? 

You won’t believe how much feature improvement that iOS 10-11 gave the iPad. 
… it’s not supposed to be an upgrade to the pro. 

That’s why it costs 300-400 less. 
Unless they removed support, the camera connection kit still probably supports USB keyboards. 
The pros need that processor for the super high refresh rate and more pixels. The iPad 2018 will keep up with anything you want to do for several years. 
Then get a 49 dollar crayon instead. 
Then wait for the 2019 iPad. You aren’t getting much out of the upgrade unless you need more speed that a reinstall can’t provide. 
2017 iPad is dead. Long live 2018 iPad. 
Try an iOS reinstall and then restore a backup before you decide that it’s just dead. 
Apparently you don’t check out the high end game markets. There are plenty of games that will warm up an iPad Pro. 
It’s more that good tablet hardware doesn’t exist. So software isn’t designed for tablets. So nobody makes tablet hardware. 

It’s a vicious cycle. 

Same with android wear. 
For the motherboard specs maybe. But the touchpad,screen,material are all up there. Then there’s the extra crap like the Touch bar and high quality fingerprint sensor. 

It almost makes me want one.

Round faces are because mechanical watches swing their metal dick around. Graphical information devices work better when you can put text/data full width. Especially when scrolling is involved. 
The main benefit of the pro now is True Tone, quad speakers, and screen size. The rest is cosmetics.

Restaurants.. I just bookmark them on yelp. It sorts them by distance. It is the food POI database for Apple anyway. Clicking any photo in the maps app for food opens the yelp app to that page. 

As for recipes.. yeah.. just save them in the system you get them from. Or save the safari page as a PDF (first party function in the share menu) and then save it to Apple notes under a recipes folder.

The “notch” doesn’t get in the way of anything. 

Any app that forces overlap of content is designed wrong. 

As for video, if there was no horns, then that space would be black.  They give the horns color pixels and you crap your pants as if the notch stole your video. 
The Pixel phones don’t even bother with it. It’s not a game changer, just a minor convenience. 
Highly unlikely?

Unless the phone was designed and produced in under six months, then it’s impossible that the essential phone had any influence.

The comment OP was referring to articles repeating themselves. 
Tango was a high-end dream that was never going to get off the ground. It required a lot of super sensors in phones. Not even Samsung had any interest in that. 
Then Apple came out and was like “we can do this with all of our existing phones back a few generations” and Google was like “Shit, we are going to be way behind in the market share“. So they dumped majority of the tango tech, and quickly pushed out something that was, in practice, very close to ARKit. Something that developers could use now, instead of five years from now when IR rear sensors were a thing. 

Apple always planned to run AR on earlier devices. Google is trying to back port it. 

I’m not saying that the code was abandoned. I’m saying that they removed all the super sensing parts, just so they could do it with just accelerometers and cameras. And so we could run it on any hardware. 
Warby Parker does this on ARkit. I’m sure it’s being written for ARcore as well. 
Some of the early ARkit apps were 3D-space tape measures that were surprisingly accurate, and would remain in place if you turned away and back. No QR or reference points needed. Those are mainly just for size reference on single camera devices. 

They led to being able to place fixture points at corners and doors and being able to build house blueprints. 

This was during the first week.

ARcore is inspired by ARkit, and they’ll take inspiration from each other and likely developers will be able advance apps on both platforms on an even pace. 

So as for asking “how reliable”. That is up to the build quality of the compass and accelerometer and other such details. Android offers choice. One of those choices is that you get what you pay for. But anything new above 400 should be fine. 
After tomorrow.

When docked at home to dual screen, my MBP is just full time full screen safari.  Desktop 1&2 are now on my 30in screen. 

On all desktops, they randomly choose a background every 15 mins from a folder auto-generated/published by Lightroom.

Android users know what they’re getting into if they buy **Apple** Airpods. Vs updating their existing beats headphones. 
The Apple Watch 3 is semi-compatible with Qi. It’s very picky about them, and nobody is sure what the difference is. 

AirPower is to Qi, what the W1 chip is to Bluetooth. They’re just modded addons to standards, and compatible underneath. 

The main difference with the AirPower puck is that it doesn’t have location based coils, and can charge fully across its surface. They claimed to be submitting that tech upgrade to the Qi standards body. 
It only works for loosies. They have to be within range of one/any of your Apple devices. And I don’t think they work within the case even in range. And the case only if open, unless I’m mistaken. 

In addition, Apple records a “last connected” location point. 



Guardians 1 is WAAAAAY better. Go watch it. Today. Now. 
**BeatsX** have longer battery life. Actual noise isolation.  Cannot fall off your body EVER. And full controls. Lightning charge port. 

*Cons*, what do you do with them when not listening? You now have a necklace on. 
Cannot use while charging, I’d love to have a small battery in my shirt pocket on long work days. Android users are SOL since they have a lightning charge port.

•

**Airpods** are extremely convenient. They can be worn one at a time. Can charge in your pocket, both or singly while using the other. Extremely tiny pocket case with 24hr or power. Find my Airpods. Pulling out one pauses them, and can be set to double tap to FF/RW/Siri. You can share audio with a friend. Second gen case will have QI charging. 

*Cons*, you’ll forget the case on a restaurant table every four months. You have to be careful putting a hoodie on when wearing them. Designed to NOT be sound isolating as a feature. No volume controls except on watch/phone/siri. 

•

Both have extremely impressive distance range. I wear my airpods most of the day, and use my beats X for work because of sound isolation. I don’t want to admit that it might be a little bit because I’m too lazy to pull off the dual flange tips. 
You don’t have to shove them in so that the cord won’t pull them out. 
I have both. (Beats for work). Both are glorious in their own way. Yet very different approaches.

The 10.5 is a glorious screen, amazing quad speakers... and best of all…  has pencil support, which you may need for quick notes. 

The 12.9 is a purpose built machine that you should only get if you really need it. It’s screen is basically the same size as an A4 paper. 
iPad doesn’t have folders. But you can access Dropbox directly through the files app.

Files.app is an access point to any (updated) online storage system. They’re all accessible in a recognizable similar way, and switching between storage systems is almost on par with switching drive letters on windows. It syncs in the background, and is a save/load point for many apps, and most document apps. 
..… no

They mount as letter drives on windows. He’s talking about precleaning

.… the MacBook escape is the 13in MacBook Pro with an escape key instead of a touch bar. 

The MacBook “one” or MacBook nothing, or just MacBook.. that is the 12in with a single port. 
Likely uses less power. 
Usually it’s the other way around. “That’s not how you say that” and I give her the correct pronunciation. 
... In the way that the fractions 2/3rds and 1/3rd are similar I suppose. 
Yeah. If that had had phones with Bluetooth for a few years before they killed the headphone jack, that would have been better. 
Lost it at visible internals. The LEDs just celebrated that loss. 
I’ve created groups with iOS contact apps, and they affected the built in contacts app. The API provides that ability. I just never click groups so I don’t bother using it. 
Ignoring looks by taste entirely... How is it’s hardware compared to apple’s.

Key word there. Sell. 
Tweetbot HAS this same feature. 

A few years from now the dev will have moved on, and you’ll be on your third app since. 

This is maaaybe an hour of coding at best. And a 20 min check. And that’s if he’s watching tv at the same time. 
Google photos has zero customization. It's all blind trust in their AI.

They are, truly, the tramp stamps of laptops. 
This kills the MacBook. 
Looks like two linked dogs, with the link in the bun. 
Smugmug does display it. That’s why I have the publishing plugin strip that data on upload. 

Google Photos / Plus as well. 
Not everyone wants to do an open source project. Some people prefer to have their privacy and their own secret sauce. Artists work in their own comfort zones, and not everyone wants to train you how to clone them. 
Nope. All internet boredom. She was netflixing every season while we had the flu in January. 
Or, paste it in iMessage and text it to yourself. That would have been my first thought. 

They both work though. 
For that price, you won’t have to buy another iPad. 
The Gilmore Girls house is a built set house, yet was used in a dozen different films/shows. It was even used as two separate GG character’s houses on that tv show just by using the front and back of the house. Outside views and the rooms inside were split up for it.

That’s why he said it was a timed trap. 
Those ten digits as a number actually does block no caller ID calls. 
Just make a new contact, give it the number 000-000-0000, and then block that contact. 

Tada!

(Yes it actually works)
And I have to stop myself from saying hey Alexa sometimes when I happen to use one.

I checked a week one HomePod on spirit airlines. Everything went fine. 
Look around at things and start asking “why?”  That’s how you learn. 
You convinced me to skip pc. As this is the feature I most care about on the list. 
A lot of people believe that is mostly the weight and grip of the cord. 
Sounds like a gambling/lottery addiction. 
Much more worth it than the movie. The weird parts make much more sense when the entire storyline is stretched over a year or so, instead of a week. 
It means they put skulls on it. Definitely one of the baddies. 
That’s exactly how it works. Such as if you grow a beard or wear crazy glasses, the Face ID fails at like “almost but not quite” and typing the pin code teaches it that it is still you. It is weighted to use your original scan plus your most recent trainings. 

As for attention for Face ID.. That is the default. You turn that off if you have lazy eye or heavy infrared blocking sunglasses, or just have issues. Turning them off is in accessibility and not advised. I think you can be face scanned in your sleep if you turn that off. Only mess with that if you’re having problems with your phone. 

Attention aware features are things like “don’t dim the screen because you know I’m still looking at you”. 
I’m not sure why I’d use this over the notes app. I can even include photos of the scan tag in the notes app, and share it with a family member or roommate. 

I guess it’s prettier. 

Maybe I don’t have enough devices for this to be useful. Maybe at the second dozen. 
“Some people are dicks man.”
It'll take more than half a decade before the world manufacturing has upgraded enough for Apple to use OLED across the board. 
Can't be sloppy if it's highly intentional. It's only used to displays items that the 8 currently has to push the content down for. 

I don't know why people draw iPads with them though. That's just silly. You hold them on the sides with the palm of your hand, not your fingertips. Bezels are still allowed. 
As soon as they figure out how to “simplify” Automator to match workflow. 
Not for me. Nor my cousin, nor my friend, or his son. We all don’t need that feature, but it is a thing for spouses or small children who abandon personalization and decide to share. 
Don’t worry. A lot of android phones with cutouts are being developed for you. 
Barely worked..?  Where are you reading this at? It works the same as when I received my preorder X. 
That’s an OLED thing I believe. 
Checkout registers and interactive displays wouldn’t use an iPad Pro. 
Disabling what enhanced features?  

It learns every time you type in the pin code. The stories early on came out because similar family members were using the same device many times and both typing in the pin code regularly. 

If that person didn’t already know the pin code, then it wouldn’t have mistaken them for the owner. 
This isn’t android. 
You’re joking right?  A minor flaw at best. 
Whenever I think about Trek tablets, I think about scenes on DS9 where someone is handed a stack of tablets, as if they only contain one book or paperwork each.

Nobody working for Apple or essential call it a notch. 

They call them ears or horns. Additions, not a takeaway. 
It’s not originally a minecraft thing. So a lot of authors could have pulled in that idea. 
That has nothing to do with Google drive. Photos is a separate service with separate albums. 

Photos’ Albums are not Drive’s Folders. 
Chat has been out for months. It’s a reason to have the official app installed. 
It shows up as a shared album with an option to auto download them into your own set of photos. 

Why not have standard shared albums between your two accounts. Just use the year in the title. 

Share :: 2018 Photos
Share :: 2017 Photos
Share :: CC Screensaver

I did when I switched from my heavily jailbroken 6S to my X. 

But that was just avoiding all the junk from a profile that had been through about 8+ jailbreaks and backup restores over the years. 
It’s been less than 11 years since the first iPhone release. The first Android phone isn’t even that old. 
This topic seems to be more about switching to the banks that are compatible. 
A feature most people here wouldn’t use even if they owned one. 
Im used to the MacBook-Esc, because it has the escape key. 
https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/24/5141416/apple-confirms-primesense-acquisition

Apple bought Kinect way before hello existed. They just took a little longer to shrink it further. The existence of hello likely didn’t speed up the release of Face ID at all. 
Hello and the X use similar tech. Because Apple bought the company who made Kinect, and then miniaturized it to fit in a phone. 
Comparing Face Unlock to Face ID is like comparing a bathroom door lock to a vault. Of course it’s going to be slightly faster. But the key word is slightly. 

You’re more likely comparing the follow up animation speed. 
Is the dongle a bad DAC?
He was complaining about low quality. Not trying to make it worse. 
The only major design change that matters on all sides lately is the growing screen-to-body ratios. 

That “looks the same” is an android owner belief, but it’s not what drives anyone on that side. 

As for Apple, Since they’re going to be completely switching to X-style phones.. then a lot of people are going to be upgrading just for that new screen. They’re about to make billions all over again. With Reddit shouting “But notches are ooogly!!!” The whole time.

That’s when the resale value on button iPhones will drop. 
You’re welcome for no gold. That was all me.

Maybe (for a start) they count Live Photos as two.   
HEIF contains even more than that. Bursts, the still, the motion vid, the before and after edits. The HDR shots. Etc 

GP interface might only show the single shot but the dashboard shows the underlying number. 

Maybe. 
This kind of excess crud is why people are ditching Facebook. 
Quickcharge cost… how much when it came out?  It’s a dumb transition period. It sucks because it’s just starting out, true. 

But the nice benefits about them switching to a universal standard, is that I could even use this car charger for my next laptop after my 2015 pro. 

And I did just drop your estimate by nearly 30 dollars. A daily deal would drop it further. 
http://www.belkin.com/us/p/P-F7U013/
80?  I got mine from belkin for like 30. You’re going off those old articles where the iPad 12.9 “charges faster on the MacBook charger”. 

Do people want Apple to make a non-compatible, non-standard speedy charging standard like Qualcomm did?
TWO SMART LOCKS!!!! /s
I am currently connecting a 36W USB-C PD car charger to my iPhone X, and it uses it. They’re catching up with quickcharge.  I believe it’s more of a battery safety thing, As well as using an existing standard.

The X & 8, as well as the 10.5” & 12.9” iPad Pros take advantage of USB-C PD. 
When you go to Notification Center, you swipe upward to scroll down further and see more notifications.  The lock screen is a mirror of this gesture. 

By visual effect, they are actually the same location. You are dismissing the Notification Center and lock screen the exact same way. 

Good or bad, that’s what they intended. The “why” of it. 
Change your bookmark to this… 

I copied the url from the “switch to desktop view” link.

only about 1/3 of the Google ones are…

looking at you Google home/wifi/inbox. 
Rest finger to unlock was in accessibility to handle disabilities, even if you like it. There isn’t even a real button anyway. 

Also negates the brand new iOS 11 feature of hiding your notification text behind a fingerprint scan. 

This is not me saying one way is better than the other. It’s just what they are doing.
Its notch or bezels, take your pick.

I prefer to think of it as the screen is half shown, as opposed to half covered.
It’s designed to keep swipe to unlock. They compare the face scan to resting your finger on Touch ID. And swiping is coded the same as pressing the home button afterwards. It’s all about reading your notifications before you actually enter the phone.

I think that if you expect Face ID to take you directly to the home screen in the future, you’re going to be disappointed. At least not until they have a design concept overhaul.
You have it backwards... Apple believes that (in the case of non-twins) Face ID is more secure than Touch ID, and that anything else is half assing it. 
FaceID is very fast. It’s just that it unlocks your phone, but does not dismiss the lock screen. A difference of design style from android, that will carry over into Face ID 2. 
Do you (on average) run your screen a bit dimmer than adaptive suggested?
Possibly a little due to iOS blatantly telling users that adaptive brightness saves battery life. It’s even forced on as part of low power mode. 

Info carries over. 
Unless you’re on the top US carriers, be happy if they support them at all. 

There’s a reason my iOS contact favorites are set to “FaceTime audio” as default method of contact.  
Because it’s been doing it that way longer than the EU has existed. Verizon never had Sim tech, and is the biggest carrier.. so we can’t just drop it. 
You can buy an unlocked phone just fine. I’m typing this on an unlocked iPhone X. I paid upfront preorder and I have no restrictions. 

When I WAS on sprint years ago. I would take any sprint phone (yes that’s how we think of them) and dial *2 and quickly tell them “I want to use this phone on my existing number” and it would be switched fairly quick. Not sure about Verizon. 
… That seems like a tedious gesture for something you may have to do multiple times an hour if you’re small enough to need it. 

On iOS it’s done by resting (not pressing) on the home touchid sensor twice, or tugging down on the bar on iPhone X. 

Samsung needs to add the first party (second?) ability to remap that. 
You are. But you responded directly to an iP X comment so it seemed to go in that line, and fit well. 
And this is why Apple made a rule that all brand new apps have to support the iPhone X starting in April. 
It’s faster to change which watch face on the watch than any possible shortcut on the iPhone. 

The rest, sure. 
… iMessage on iOS prioritizes encrypted data messaging (blue texts) instead of sms if it senses another iOS device.  
You can send via carrier number as a username, your Apple ID email as a username, or an alias email address (up to 5?), by choosing the default “from” in settings.   Sharing your number is optional, as is enabling the data functions at all.

If you send from an iOS tablet or Mac.. it texts “from” your default choice In it’s own settings.. giving your connected number as an available option. 

Connecting a number is optional. 
The S8/9 look like black bars and pretend it goes edge to edge. 

The iPhone actually goes to the edge on the bottom, and just as close as the S8 on the top. It’s a bit more forward facing. 

Though I’m sure you see it as “the S8 is symmetrical so it’s better” And that opinion is fine. 
Choose to believe that if you like. I forget it’s even there most the time. 

If it wasn’t there, all iOS would show is a clock anyway. That’s the only thing located in that space on an iPhone 8. 
Apps such as games (or assholes that don’t need to but do anyway) can use the entire screen as they like. Including using or ignoring the ears. 

People call it a notch (a removal), but it’s coded as choosing to use the ears (additions). One popular camera app puts the histogram/ISO in the ears so the camera screen has zero overlay. 
I’ve had whatsapp installed for two years. I have 300+ phone contacts. I deal with record labels, artists. Promoters. Etc. (Photographer here)

I scan my contacts right now and I see maybe 10 WhatsApp users that all but two have default status and MAYBE an icon set. 

Duo/allo show about four users that have it installed. I do that by “start private message” and it only shows registered numbers using it. 

US user. The app is useless to me, despite giving it a good shot. They’re installed and in a random folder, along with telegram and Vero and etc. 

Then explain to her why you’re the only person she’ll ever meet that has it installed. 
Messenger allo and duo should be combined, to replace/upgrade hangouts. With the phone number as the username, (like iMessage does). 
Ship a million, get forty rejects. 

Seems reasonable. 
Hated it on the 6S, love it on the X. Or maybe my sensor was weak.. but they have tuned it well. 
The notch is only hated by people who’ve never used an X longer than 5 mins. 

The X chose to shove stats up in the corners, instead of pulling them down a quarter inch like Samsung did. Better tucked up and out of the way so that apps own the whole top row. Besides, you stare at the middle/bottom of a phone.. not the top.  iOS doesn’t have much at the top to mess with.
Allo should have been part of android Messenger. Then it would have been a direct competitor to iMessage. Ridiculous that it was made it’s own app. 
Android notches will be odd gimmicks until android supports it directly in P.    
Native support is the way to go, so all apps can support it proper. 
I think the x was them just being excited about their new design… while not yet financially able to put it all in as the main series yet. I don’t think that there will be a one single top level phone for that long. One can hope. Or maybe we all do want them to have that one god-tier phone. 
I don’t know if the worlds supply of OLED can handle that yet. Maybe so.
He’s talking about a $300+ little 2 terabyte drive. A decent WD NAS and a basic AC router would be cheaper for more space. 
While the airport is capable of extending the hard drive. The point of it, is to be a back up of your existing files within your computer. You would not be using it for what it’s real purpose was. Like they say, you would be better off with a NAS. 
Majority of the wow factor was just the screens being updated by two specific companies. 
Last year was an exciting year because both companies released new crazy designs. This year is going to be boring because they are going to be minorly extending on those designs from last year.
Screens are very easy to point at. It’s all about internals again, and that’s less exciting to people.
This is not the first time that they did not leapfrog.
Bad bot

I already miss Compy. He was so much more friendly. 
But now you’re getting into a very nuanced situation. That’s like saying you could use the HomePod to pause your phone. Which is not generally the expectations when you say you’re able to do so. 

The Google Home can straight up pause a chrome cast. And I am looking forward to when a HomePod can pause all local airplay devices by name.
homepod literally says "I'm sorry, I cant Pause other devices"

I know this because I just asked it to pause the apple tv by network name.
Possibly partially due to the fact that you’re not supposed to be able to edit the hosts file.
If you are buying a MacMini straight from Apple… it is not worth the money. They are like three or four years out of date, and they were a little overpriced when they were first announced. 

I know this because I want a new one. But yes, it would be fast enough. I suggest looking for a refurbished model.
The main problem is that it’s very easy to use the iPad without it directly facing your face. The iPhone, you can get a dock that stands up the phone towards you, but that is actually inconvenient with an iPad.
He means talking to the HomePod to control the Apple TV. Like you can do with Google Home and chrome cast.
Never failed… right. 

Laying in bed here, it’s failed at least 3 times for me this morning. 

But walking around, yes it’s a lot better.
They didn’t rush it out. They announced it early but it’s fairly baked except for airplay 2, which is the main reason it was delayed at all. 

Any major software updates are more likely coming in iOS 12. 
Manually delete them or archive them. Google can’t tell your tastes. And they never delete, they just index files.

Besides that’s not a lot, my iphone has 22,000 images in it.. and one of my Google photos accounts has 100,000 photos. So You could have them sorted in just a month or so of “I’m bored” browsing/sorting. 
The ratios are all over the place on that screenshot anyway. 
I did this years ago with smart playlists and my iPod. 

3 star songs I haven’t heard in 2 months.   
4 star songs I haven’t heard in 1 month.   
5 star songs I haven’t heard in 1 week    

I called it my radio list. 

Too bad I’m on Spotify now. 

Edit: dug these up and fixed them for the latest iTunes. (Don’t need media kind & etc anymore). You’ll need to edit based on your quantity of rated songs, I had 3000+. 

https://imgur.com/a/jAFRR/
Keep your backup and find out… It SHOULD sync with your collection (and then use app store versions in the phone of anything it recognizes, and your version for anything it doesn't recognize) 

Just dont set it to clear your computer to make space.. Or it will delete the recognized local copy, allowing you to stream the synced/store version from their servers.
So, like people said about the first Apple Watch. Which is now the number one selling watch, of any kind, in the world… without dropping its price. 

Got it. 
It’s true because it’s the only way to do it. 
Okay. It's like comparing the iPhone X to the Moto G based only on the assistant. and ignoring the camera, screen, etc
As long as you remove almost everything that makes sound, to take the cost down.

That’s like judging a car for being too expensive, because you can buy a chair that is just as comfy, for cheaper.
I’ve been running the beta since version two. I kind of just leave it on. It’s working fine for me. 
The thing that gets me is how everything is out of alignment on the announcement image. Random vertical spacing, and overlapping of the bottom sentence over the image. They need to work on that UI. 
If they just merged the number usernames feature from Allo, it would be a clone of all the benefits of iMessage
At least until they release Verizon messenger.
That’s apps updating and marking elements as a “don’t invert” 
It’s not small and significant. That would be fairly opposite situations. In his case it’s a constant bonus to his day. 
The answer is “no unless you want to airplay music” and I haven’t even watched. 

None of these speaker systems things are “should you get”. 
They wrote it before them so they don’t have to reference them. Starfleet is so powerful at the end of each of those series that most battles at that level would be ridiculous.
Skip “moving them” by adding “open in photos” at the end of the export dialogue. 
Try running [Fing](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fing-network-scanner/id430921107?mt=8) to see what’s on your network. 
If it matters... besides customization, The main benefit would be local cache of images if there's a wifi burp. 
how about a raspberry pi, a photo screensaver, and something like Google Drive, so you can drop-in or pull out photos. 

Nearly the same price as a Chromecast, and you get to control it completely.
There are more OLED mobile screens than OLED desktop screens by a huge margin.
Just so I stop checking every time theres a new Reddit youtube post… does it announce it is available to you?
They do, but Apple makes for good headlines. Also their SMS app is integrated into the system. Android apps can build their own text rendering on a per app basis. 
Go check /r/audiophile for the reviews by gloriously stuck up bastards who bought it just for fun as opposed to guessing it all sucks. 

It was built by a company who has billions to toss on a project, with testing equipment that millionaire speaker builders dream of. 
And how do you tell the source to pause. 
So like airplay can transmit any content?  

HomePod is a receiver. And a first gen. 

Chromecast audio is a transmitter of audio with no speaker, designed to upgrade older systems. You can get audio airplay adapters on amazon. 
The keyboard seems to be more about hand happiness than eye happiness. 
Put that money towards replacing the series 0 instead. That’ll do more for you on a day to day basis. 
That makes me want to move to a separate room despite that I don’t even have one of those in here. 
You obviously didn’t read much into it. 

It measures the wall, and purposely bounces the song off of it in order to sound like a much larger sound source. 

And this thing sounds way better than decent. It’s just not 5.1 in any form. 
Add a future third party airplay 2 adapter to any third party speaker for maximum compatibility. 
You can setup a Google Home or Alexa with a Mac or pc? Since when. 
W1 isn’t an ecosystem. It’s a Bluetooth addon correcting some of what they consider flaws. 

It’s like if they made a W3 chip that doubled Wifi range. 
You don’t need a dongle if you update your cords to the latest usb standards, for less than the price of any dongle.  Updating USB to USB-C is not at all any form of lock in. 

The only cord of any cost would be a lightning to C cord. But that’s true of any first party apple cord. Alternatives exist.
I assume that the main reason is that Siri control wouldn’t function. 

“Hey Siri, pause”.    Nope. 

You can’t do anything but set volume to 0%, and it’s supposed to be hands free. 
Are we pretending hangouts is a good iOS app? 
The fact that you can load 1080p 60fps and 1440p on the YouTube app for iOS means it’s decoding vp9 in-app. 

YouTube only stores up to 720p in mp4. 
He’d wait at LEAST a week. 
It has only existed for a few months. Two years from now it’ll be a little more common. It still makes stories when Hey Siri saves lives. 
They could be storing login status in the trash cache. 
Jerking it with a 911 operator on the phone still counts as on your own, sorry. 
Say you’re in a car accident and your screen is smashed. This feature will still function. 

Same for a bloody teen beaten on the street and his smashed phone. 
Bluetooth sync is built into iOS. It measures the lag and compensates. 

YouTube uses its own custom codec and player, and so negates all that tech. 
They do on iPad. PIP is standard on twitch and plex and more. 
The format war that the iOS version negates by including the codec. 
It’s not capped. 720 is the highest they encode mp4.  

1080,4K,60fps are all in a different codec. One that the YouTube app provides. 
You may want to get a long USB cord to tether your camera to the computer instead of setting the self timer and praying. Assuming it will remain stationary. Monoprice is the way to go for cheap custom cords, and they sell many through the amazon marketplace. 

You definitely want an 80 or 100mm lens, depending on the space in your room. This is where the tethering comes in handy. Shoot through the ring light and manually adjust the white balance on the raw file. I suggest creating a preset that you apply on importing them, assuming you’re using Lightroom and not camera raw. 

Lower zoom numbers on lenses will cause distortion, a thinner face and pointier nose. Absolutely don’t go lower than 50mm. 

Also, STM is a tech that allows for quieter lens focus during video. 
Every one of those can be done by Siri on the watch, including “Hey siri what’s my battery.”

And if I don’t want to say it, I think swiping up for control center is faster than entering an app. 
I absolutely vote used gear. The price drops as soon as you drive it off the lot! 

I bought three 2000 dollar lenses for much cheaper through lensauthority.com

You want to search for places more local of course, since you’re using terms like 200D and that’s not the American names. 
I love the idea of Workflow. I’ve made a couple workflows. I never find it all that useful.

My most used Workflow is “open this in Safari”.
Samsung had it for years, just like split screen. It took google a while to make it vanilla. 

Google is better at “this is cool” geek features than “this is useful” good looking features. 
That majority of the actors casted are NOT fitting belter descriptions. Just a few in the start of the first season before casting gave up. 
I was frustrated that they only occasionally play up lanky body types. Then forget that’s a thing in casting. Then bring it up again.   
It’s distracting. 
Or it’s like Netflix now, if you count licensed series like expanse is. 
It’s the second time in the past ten days. 
Except I'm generally the one on tech support. 

The pause button doesn't pause the backgrounded app audio. That's not user error. 

I'm only asking if it's more widespread. As well as sending apple feedback via their /feedback bug reporting.
Loving albums shouldn't have the same weight as loving individual tracks.
I grew up on albums with skits and intros. Those don’t get loves. 
Using it on albums is just for the lazy to do it quickly. 
Likely the scanned folder is not the same as the destination. Running on the incoming files before they get sorted. 
He needs to retrain it. Probably with the OP suggestion. 
That’s because the iPhone tells the hub to tell the light to turn on, within the wifi network.  

Alexa tells amazon to tell hue to tell the hub to tell the light to turn on. 

Unless you get the new tall Echo device. That uses Zigbee for local control. So it should be faster. 
Probably need this turned on.

Generally not at all. But it’s likely to make the machine run cleaner. 
I won’t even touch T-Mobile. It works great in cities, but not between them. I crisscross the country several times a year.
If you’re on a highway, it’s a normal occurrence several times an hour. 
Why. There’s no benefit. 
None of this was about connecting to my Synology. I just want the app to ask iOS for the saved password, and pre-fill the login page. 
It doesn’t matter how the NAS is set up. this is nothing that can be changed within the app settings. This is nothing that I can change on my set up. This is all between Synology and the company’s own apps and their owned domains. It is a security handshake that happens only once, when you install the iOS app from the App Store. 

I was originally asking if synology apps tell iOS a domain name to check for keychain entries, not submitting a bug report.   
I now realize that I have to submit a feature request to the developers. 
Sorry. You missed a step. The three dots menu, tapping “parent comment” on the topmost comment does nothing. 

I’m assuming because it’s basically just a “scroll to previous comment” link. But in a deep comment link, the parent comment button needs to reload the thread on the previous comment. 
When you install an app on iOS, it registers to a domain for keychain credentials. It only does it on install. The domain itself has to have a file on it that confirms this handshake. The whole point of this is just so that when the app comes up, it displays the credentials in keychain for that register domain. It doesn’t matter if you use a custom domain or anything, as long as you have credentials saved for the domain that was set within the app.   

I’m specifically hoping for quickconnect.to or maybe synology.com to be added. If somebody disables the active use of those in their setup, they can still manually add those credentials in, registered in keychain to that domain.

iOS Settings > accounts & passwords > App & Website Passwords > add password (bottom of page)

https://i.imgur.com/R26zkPm.jpg 

The whole point... Is one-tap login, because the app knows WHICH credentials to use, as opposed to me having to browse my whole keychain. 

I believe android added a similar feature with app passwords recently. 
Another 2 bugs. 

Go to your inbox. Click any deep thread comment, such as this one. 

Scroll to the previous comment, which displays first. 

Click the 3 dots for the menu.

Click “parent comment” to see earlier in the thread. 

Nothing happens (whenever deep linking a comment.)

I keep finding bugs just while reporting bugs lol

Bug 2. Kinda. 

The comment tables aren’t colored correctly. So when you scroll off the edge the color doesn’t match. Only visible with a “view all comments” button when the highlighted comment isn’t on the bottom. 
https://i.imgur.com/PKfvRzq.jpg
It’s a black chunk in dark mode. 
It’s the spacer he uses to avoid the notch. 

Still a bug. 
He = Rocket. 

He might have already raised Groot once. 
Feature request: A “View Full Comment Thread” button at the top of the direct comment-linked post. For better context when viewing inbox responses. 

Such as:  
https://i.imgur.com/ScVsgiS.jpg

The official app displays “single comment thread — view all” and I’m asking for a comment thread button here as well. 
Apps need a “webcredentials” tag set in the code. It tells iOS which entry in keychain to bring up automatically. Such as the password saved for the https://quickconnect.to domain.   
That’s on synology web developers to add. 

https://i.imgur.com/itc1HMw.jpg

If the webcredentials is set, it looks like this:

https://i.imgur.com/C2IkLUn.jpg

That key only displays at login entries, and the login pages of DS apps do signify that they are logins to show the key. But since no webcredentials are set, I currently have to click the key and search for quickconnect from my password list. 

I understand that custom domains are also a thing. But anyone can still save credentials easily enough. I manually enter user/pass for certain apps just because they set themselves up for it.

Very informative Pinterest post.

It remembers to keep the expanded multireddit. And displays the proper chevron direction at first. It just starts using the standard element swap code without hinting that it started in reverse. 

I’m pointing out that the graphic/ASCII attached to it displays in reverse if it remembered it was expanded instead of collapsed. 

https://i.imgur.com/mGppWAT.jpg
Two more:


On the index page, page zero. 

Expand a single multireddit, so that it’s the only chevron pointing down. 

Force-close the app. (Or just if it closes normally in the background)

Open the app, the multireddit(s) is still expanded, with the chevron is pointed down, but thinks it’s up. 

Click it and the multi reddit closes while the arrow remains, unmoving, pointed down. Expanding that multireddit now, the chevron displays inverted. Down when it should be up, and vice versa.    
(Edit: https://i.imgur.com/mGppWAT.jpg)

Force quitting when the list is closed is the only fix. 

Super minor. 



The funny part is when I was confirming this on my iPad while typing on my phone.. after repeated confirmations, it started to insta-crash when I clicked on the chevrons. But only for a couple minutes. I don’t know what to blame that on. Probably iOS.

Bug 2

Clicking “No comments, it’s quiet… too quiet…” in dark mode turns it white. 

It’s the same white flash as when you click a comment to expand/squish it. But freezes white. 
Two issues. 

**Bug**

Force touch an image for the peek-menu and click “Share”.  
The follow up buttons, “share image” and “share link to image” fail and do not open the share sheet.

Very scary. I worried it was going to delete the whole collection. 

I feel like it should ask “Remove Subreddit?”


Tested on an X. 
Not superhero movies. The idea of multiple series of major movies with a highly self-influential shared narrative.

No reboots, restarts, and minimal recasting. They are not all sequels of eachother, though it has sequels within it. As well as title characters that don’t even know each other until years later (such as guardians). 

The closest thing you have to this, would maybe be the Star Wars extended universe in books. And that was highly managed to stay that way. 
It's only 35 gold coins per 5 turbo boost, and 75 for 3 blue turtle shells. What a bargain!
That and the fact that comic book characters are a 20+ major movie series. It will be discussed in film classes for decades. 
Groot gets his name because of how his noises sound like a direct translation. It's like calling a dog "Bark". 
It might even be the second time he's done that. Doesn't take long for them to grow up, and Rocket is teaching him a lot of things in GOTG 1. 

… typos
And that one conversation with Jean Gray was rather stunning, since it gave him thought bubbles. 
No, they’re uploaded with an actual high frame rate. 

This is removing the repair job the Chromecast does when the full video can’t load in. His problem is that it’s skipping frames. This checkbox makes things smoother. 
“We recommend keeping video smoothness turned on. If you turn off video smoothness, 

-	Chromecast Ultra will prioritize playing the content at the highest resolution while lowering the frame rate to fit the constraints of the TV. So a 4K TV that doesn't support 4K 60Hz will default to 4K 30Hz.
-	**Your content may appear jerky or stutter.**
-	Even if you turn off video smoothness, streaming services may force a higher frame rate to maintain video smoothness. This happens on the partner side and can’t be overridden by Chromecast Ultra. 
If I favorite a …(media) then download to my folder in … (storage)

If I’m tagged in a photo on … then download the photo to my phone. 

At sunrise, turn off my lights (in case they were left on)

If I come near home (location trigger), then turn on my porch light. 

If outside temperature rises above 60, then disable my space heater outlet.

If bitcoin drops below 9000, then set all lights to red 100%. 

If I save a post on Reddit, then add to my iOS reading list. 

If Shawn’s phone shows up on my WiFi, then send a notification to my phone.

I'm totally changing it to Hey Siri..  Someone has to do it.
I went from 0 to 3 and it became stunningly easier to get badges immediately. You could say that it was tuned too high, but I think the 0 was working through its limitations. 
It’s the DS716+II, I’ve messed with it a lot to figure out the limits of its scanning. 

If it just misses the exif dates, I drag a copy of the folder out, mass delete those files, re-scan, then drag everything back in with “move&skip” and they tend to reappear correctly. 

My current frustration is when it gets all the metadata but doesn’t generate the preview images so I just see blanks. 

My current plan is to disconnect the current published folders without deleting them, generate new ones while Moments is stopped. Let the face tagging match things over for a day or two, then delete the old (current) folders.  Possibly with some copy paste trickery so I don’t have to regen 8000 files. 

I’m just trying to solve this before I start adding in much more photos, from more than two years ago. I’m just going to survive it by stopping the Moments plugin at sync moments. 
I wish I could tell it to rescan some photos that were placed in the moments directory. If it scans a photo mid-upload it seems to view it as corrupt and never retry. I have a few dozen blank squares as I scroll around. 

Lightroom using “Publish to Folder” to within the moments directory. Highly frustrating. I have to try to remember to “stop” Moments from running before I republish changes or additions. 
So kind of like Luke Cage. 
And Walmart sells the iPhone for cheap within a month of release. Resold craigslist iphones are cheaper than stores too. 

You can get 700 off with two iPhone 8/X’s right now from T-Mobile and Verizon.

You mean slightly above. 
The only thing advanced about the pixel is the camera. Everything else about it is behind the curve. 

This post is about putting vanilla on a worthy device. 
Back at that point, every new phone was a major jump over the previous. I consider all smart phones before.. say.... the galaxy s6 or iPhone 6, to be practice for the real phones we have now. 
Minimalism vs flair. Not everyone wants to be in a rave. 
Assuming you have them all logged into the same account. You could give chrome it’s very own account and not really deal with any issues. 
Just because the progress bar is full, doesn’t mean it’s using a lot, going by the numbers. 
The HUE bloom and HUE bulb colors don’t match either, and the HUE lights strips percentages are much brighter. 

I got around it by pre-picking a few colors and manually eyeing it up and creating scenes from it. 
Why retire it? Put them side by side to see the differences in the ecosystems. 
I’d test getting an Apple TV and a switch (an ethernet splitter) and hook them and the hue in on the same spot. You may have issues with airplay but the rest should work. Maybe. Especially if you were able to temporarily use a router for five mins just to initiate the handshake to your account. 

Although I might know more about setting static IP addresses on a second router to mimic the first. So that when it goes back on the school network, the IP addresses match.

It’s generic room temp and never changes. 
Not according to this forum lately. It’s as if antique iOS posts are the new trend. 
It’s very randomized. Real corroded paths have patchwork. Such as the bushes leaning in and surrounded by mossy brick or cobble. Or sections being fully dirt. 

Also to break up the gapping a bit, you can use inner/outer corners with the stairs. The way it auto-bends when you do roofing. I assume the bedrock version doesn’t automatically go back if you place the three and then break the two you used to warp the middle stair.  For bigger potholes you can use cobble slabs as well. 
Aluminum ones. 

The square one doubles as a watch case for show-off storage, and so is stainless steel. 
I happily stand behind this one. I have the version for the 9.7 pro and it’s my favorite apple-ish case. The back feels like the front instead of hard plastic. A little soft with slight give. Almost like smooth skin. 

It folds well, has the full magnet set, and the texture feels great. I did replace it after a year with a second one after I dropped it hard and slightly warped the plastic on the corner. But mostly because “it wasn’t perfect anymore” went through my head.

Compares to the Google Home Max, yes. 

Why does everyone always say “and apple will of course release a budget model to compete”?
Well you could always get an Apple Watch as a middle man. Same diff, extra features. 
I have problems with my iHome plugs every time that my Wi-Fi burps. Always having to go back through and unplug and replug everything. I was going to switch to iDevices, but now that the new adapter has come out, I’m going to be switching them to Wemo, as those have maximum compatibility with everything. 
If you really want to teach yourself interesting games with home automation… It’s definitely worth playing with a raspberry pi as the middleman. A nice HASS setup. Possibly including this…

If you’re just going to compare it to just Alexa… Then there’s no reason to get it. It only counts if you compare it to Alexa controlling a stereo system, running a music service. 
Should I add my burnt orange X pair to the shit posts?
OG iPad stopped at iOS 5. It’s not silverlight, as that was a temporary Microsoft alternative to adobe flash. 

There’s no browser that you can use on a mobile device to access Netflix because it won’t have the necessary DRM decryption. All web browsers on iOS are literally just safari with the skin, as that’s all the rules will allow. 

So you will actually need a minimally supported version of the app. If you’re really going to run it on a completely junk version of an iPad, just get a Kindle fire at one of the hundred times a year that it goes on sale. 
If it belongs in /Photos/ on your computer, it can get dumped in photos. 

If it belongs in */Documents/* or */Documents/Important/* then it goes in Drive. 

You decide on anything in the middle. Anything like computer screenshots can be separate and sorted into a folder with Hazel or tasker or something like it deleting PNG files after a set amount of time. (A month?)
I don’t know. I get an icky feeling looking at this photo. Like walking through an antique section of a flea market where everything’s slightly broken. 

If I wanted an out of date UI running badly secure OS with buggy versions of apps, I’d run android. 
For being wrong! That’s impressive levels of wrong, taken to the top to repair.

Only foreign companies seem to know about it. 
Any new watch of any generation gets at least two days of battery life (without active fitness/cellular). So If you got a series 0 off someone, consider it a trial run… not the real thing. 

Worth it to get a new S1 instead of a battery change. The processor was a major difference. 
The logo doesn’t burn through. It uses the same light as the rest of the screen. 
Armada was a result of Earnest Cline getting mad that he had to rush out a second book. 

I discourage anyone from thinking its worthy of time spent, and I will list reasons on request.

Waves and one light. Then you know it’s turned on. 
I think “enter a user” and “enter a subreddit” should all be moved into the search. Just show as direct links below as you type. 
Android Pay, as a name, was as smart an idea as iOS-Pay would have been. 
This seems an obvious move if they want to use “android pay” on desktop chrome or chrome top. Especially when apple was like “now it works in safari” and Google was like “umm we’re still using wallet for that? Shit!”

/s as fuck.  
I’m sure they would have concluded that naming it after one of their half dozen operating systems was a bad idea at some point. 
I thought the same until I thought of it as a zombie’s thigh. 
I think I’m blind and you should show it to me with eclipse turned on. 
iMessages are. 
The percentage is just an estimate based on battery stats, plus or minus 10%. So freaking out about it not being there is kinda..…

What is the “liftoff” besides hope. I’m horrible ill-informed
In my experience it has a lot to do with time zones. But many other factors can happen. 
Because Apple and Google take a lot of liberties in tweaking a lot of the data to get the most pleasing aesthetics of picture possible. 

Nikon and canon’s auto mode is years behind, and will never bother to tweak the data enough to improve your photo. So they survive only on the hardware superiority that they still have. 
I very much did like using it as well. 
Can’t take away something they never had. But it’s part of the license to use on their network, as well as keeping the warrantee. 
I think Rhodey would have to quit the military before he ads remote. The government owns/licenses that suit. 

Stark probably only provides updates as long as rhodey is the pilot. 
His best friends fall probably inspired a parachute update. 

Also a war machine chute would be huge. 
So the left hand AND the right hand. 
They’re talking about the first few days as photos and Siri re-index everything. 
They don’t plan to stop making MCU movies. There’s no complete end game. 

They already announced that they have the next 22 movies planned. I’m not joking. 
It isn’t. But It will at 99.5 percent
Are you trolling or drunk
Not really. With the Apple care, if my iPhone X back glass cracks, they’ll swap it for 30 bucks. 

That basically requires giving me a new phone. A 539 dollar standard fix. 

They’ll do it twice. 

I really hope my back glass doesn’t crack right before my Apple care runs out. That would be ironic. 
If it’s going to collapse, it’s only going to collapse once. So it’s not a thing that will happen often in the city.

This is a record snowfall in a short amount of time. It’s not a record for how much snow has been out on the grass in front of the house. The question is how long before we go back to temperatures above freezing, and how many times it snows before then. And shit roofs with bad insulation will just melt off a lot of their snow into icicles anyway. 
I don’t have problems. I also did a backup restore when I switched up. It’s good to do that now and then. 
I’m responding on a 6S plus and saying have fun with that. 
all A8 & A9 phones, and recently A10. 
Percentages are just guesses based on randomly testing the battery and mathing it to expected minutes left. Your problem is your phone not having a clue what the fuck to do with the information that your battery is reporting back. 
That's only "materials". Keep in mind the guy taking 20 mins to swap your battery gets paid 20 dollars an hour. 
Maybe you missed the last sentence of “I was helping her set up.”   
She asked me, and I was explaining as I go after I restored her backup. I showed her that auto-update would take care of the triple digit red number on the App Store and flicked it on, and she panicked that her new phone would get slow. With “evidence” that her old iPhone wasn’t slow because she never did app updates. 

This was transitioning from a 5S to a 7


As for feelings being hurt. It was headshaking wierdness
It dropped 60%. 

With stock space, materials, testing, precharging, highly paid employee time, et cetera.. that’s practically at cost for them, if not at a loss. 
As per the daring fireball article, many Apple employees would quit if they were told to do that. They have pride in their work and people at that level can work anywhere they want. 
With the new announcement, it's better to let Apple do it for 29 and keep your warranty on it. 
They didn't. 
Apple just dropped the price of batteries by more than half. 
First party or third party battery? Just curious. 

I have a 6S plus on my desk next to my X, and both are fine.
Theres no "stay with performance". The 6S processor, doing a peak task, would reach for the battery power it needed. Finding much less available, it would choke and die. 

That's what the 6S did before they enabled the throttle. And so they removed the processor's ability to peak as high.

Unrelated Side note: Every rumor of "apple slowed my iPhone" before 10.2.1 is still a rumor.
Its more that after a set amount of time (or a crash), iOS sets Music.app to default.  Without it, iOS does its best to remember what you were last using, even if you have to press play a few times to kick it in the butt.

If Apple removed the "set Music.app back to default" function, then I wouldn't mind leaving it in place.
You're comparing to a device that has over 10,000x the user base of the nexus, and 100x the userbase of the pixel.

On a daily walk through NYC.. You're far more likely to see a 4" display iPhone than any phone that has nexus on it.
If the person never checks for updates, then they are the person who should have auto-update turned on. The kind of person who doesn't know what Reddit is. 
Except it is ignorable inside games. Takes a double swipe like the notifications shade.  
It's a pain in the ass when i'm playing Portal Bridge Constructor.  
Thats to be expected when you demand OEM. They'd have to actively be manufacturing them for it to not have sat on a shelf waiting for you.
So subscribe to /r/apple and you'll know on that day.
1. The integrated batteries are bigger in a small space, as the battery uses up the space that would be filled in with plastic as you access the internals. 

2. People on average who buy batteries, will buy the cheapest one they can find on amazon that claims it fits their device.
They shouldn't let people silence it because it's a security hazard. And the people that leave a red notification on the settings app are, on average, the same people that have (17,469) on the mail app.
Welcome to android!
Apple admitted they throttle cpus to extend battery life on a shit battery. 
Ehh. She’s one of those that was so babied (fourth in a line of boys) that she’s 20 going on 14. It just came to mind to type that as I woke up. 
My teen cousin won't turn on auto-update apps on iOS because her "never touched iOS in my life" older brother hammered her that all updates slow down his android phones.   I turned auto-update on for her once and she ripped it out of my hands in a panic and turned it off.  It was a brand new iphone I was helping her setup.
If a device was too old to update to the latest OS, that mean's its literally at least half a decade old, and the Developer of the app chose to abandon supporting the old device. 

Try updating a 6 year old android phone to the latest OS. 
MacOS default setting is to "Automatically check for Software Updates". Just disable that if you dont want asked. I'll sit here perfectly content on the latest version with no bugs in my daily usage.  

And in my experience, my friends dont even realize they are much out of date, even when on iOS 10.  I've got an iOS 10 iPad in front of me and it hasn't asked me once. (Nephew's now-replaced iPad)
The average user wouldn't read it at all.. They'd just click update or look at the shiny red number on the settings icon that they're used to ignoring. I have two friends on iOS 10 that had no idea they were out of date. They thought it auto-updated like their apps.
so change the battery.

It would actually probably be cheaper to get a refurb iPad Air, or a store-returned iPad 2017 (iPad 7)
You're right, in that you just hit "cancel" instead of "no"
So I get it that if you are in a sub Reddit, the index shows usernames. And if you are at the front page or a multireddit, the index displays subreddits...

As much as I would prefer that the app shows both items on the front page on my iphone, I would at least suggest that you have room on the iPad to display both. I often catch myself looking for usernames when on the front page, and realizing they are not there.
Need to just look for a 10W charger, as the X/8 wireless fast charge draws 7.5W of power. 
And what if you get those two feet in under four hours? Or overnight. 
Source: Erieite

Two feet doesn’t even shut schools down here. 
You can upload photos to Instagram from safari, if that helps. 
It started at 10.2.1, nobody reads the article sources. 
The fastest charging iPhones will accept is still much less than Qualcomm quickcharge. 

You buy a 10W wireless charger so that the iPhone 8/X can pull 7.5W from it. 
If you backed up to iTunes, it copied the apps from the phone to your mac. Most people consider backing up to iCloud as the standard now. 
Wont matter unless you can get to 10.2, pre throttle. And if jailbreakers could do that… so many would. 
What? That sounds like planned obsolescence!

One of those people that leaves online backups on but doesn’t have icloud storage. 
They admitted they throttle down peak performance of phones with bad batteries so they don’t die too quick.  That’s all they admitted. That’s all the findings show. 
They brought it back with the X
I didn’t like that he treated it like they had a full life and relationship together. It was like six months.  
It was always issues the Asgard can solve quickly if they were told.. and I think they rightly realized that having a babysitter on all missions was tedious.   

The reason given that they died was stupid, as making offspring should have been easy. But it was an “any excuse is a good one” type of thing. 
You’re looking at the “sponsored” posts, aren’t you. 

They hike the price to cover sponsoring it. Then they hike the price because sponsoring works. 
Tap the preview and you get an edit/crop/send page. You can send/copy from there, but clicking “done” is where the delete option is. You’re exiting the page without clicking “Done” to get the delete option, and default is to save it. 
Funny. You could in iOS 10 with hidden photos. They still showed in albums. 

Sadly now they also hide from all albums too in 11. 
Umm. On the MacBook photos.app there’s a “key photo” option. I’m not sure on the phone itself. But the functionality exists. 
Screenshot album has been there since iOS 7. Just for clarity. 
You know what happens when you assume...

This is edging close to two decades ago. Maybe one in the case of this movie.
Somehow I think that’s on the device app. 
A deal with Apple?
ARM is slower because it’s primarily designed for batteries. This is why intel is still playing catchup on mobile. 

Picture Apple designing an A-series chip with much less power limitations, but only for the MacBook non-pro.  A device that rarely runs windows.  

Then go ahead a few more generations in time. 
The difference between an old iPhone and an old android phone is that the iPhone has the option to actually change their OS version number after two years. 
Within ten years fleets will be popular. Within 25 years it’ll be taboo to own a car that doesn’t self drive. It’ll take 40 years for self driving to be 90% mandatory by location. Fleets are only useful inside cities, by people who have lost “pride of ownership” of a device. The “my own car” is up there with “my own home”.   

I, Robot the shoddy movie had a good idea of how future traffic customs will be. Even though they envisioned odd custom highways in cities. 

Apple has a jump plan where you pay monthly for a phone and get a new phone every year. That hasn’t made owning a phone obsolete. 
All possible via extension apps, in an application designed for the general population.  Expecting all that in the default app is just silly. 

If I shoot 12k photos at an event, I don’t want to load all of them into my standard phone library. 
If Microsoft and Google don’t have to make professional editing software, than Apple doesn’t either. Run Pixelmator Pro or luminear or any of the other systems that integrate with the existing extension system.  

I personally use Lightroom, and my default export option has “open in photos.app”. 
I wonder. If you could do minute adjustments to the color until accurate with color blind tests.. wouldn’t using the camera app be like wearing those color blind eyeglasses everyone cries about in YouTube videos? 
The recent android/iOS operating system versions have after-render color shifting to assist color blind users. Does that help?
What they said. Reddit admin. But to clarify, they have the option of disabling the flag in their posting screen. So you may sometimes be responding to admins/employees who are unflagged. 
The UI was good. The processing was behind. The moment I took my photos to Lightroom, it was so much easier to take my shots to a finished state. 

The WORST was concert LED lights. Aperture didn’t have a clue how to handle extreme lighting and just turned the whole photo solid red in gigantic sections. 
Are you comparing to the latest version though? Every year should be another shot at winning your affection. 
There is. It’s called extensions. 

Good is subjective. 
Aperture was behind the curve even when it’s updates were brand new. It was created to meet demand in a market and prove the platform. It was abandoned for superior competitors. I processed tens of thousands of photos in aperture and moved to Lightroom before Ap was dropped. 

You should look at Lightroom CC being the nightmare scenario. They’re doing what you worried about without any help from Apple. 
The latest versions are very worthy, as long as you don’t relying on nested albums or nested rules.   But with iCloud Photo Library it’s a direct clone of your photos between applications. 
That’s what people were worried about with gatekeeper. And it turned out to be quite a good addition to MacOS. 
Isn’t this worthy of a 3.0 on android? 

Looks good so far. 

Update: I’ll clarify my assumption. 

The android version number is likely about versioning what the coders see.    
The iOS version number is likely about versioning what users see. 
Photos.app is a fully universal app between iOS and macOS. The interface is coded to use UIkit on iOS and UXkit on macOS. So we’ve been running this exact arrangement since iphoto died. It’s also why photos.app is one of the very few apps to have extensions in the Mac App Store. (Safari content blockers being another.)

I wouldn’t be surprised if many of the other apps that were coded to mimic iOS didn’t get killed for invisibly transitioned UXkit alternatives in this upcoming change. 
Now you sound like a jail breaker. 
Photos.app is the guinea pig and proof of concept. It’s already running on the code that this transition will use. 
This is almost exactly like comparing Samsung face recognition with Face ID. 
They’ve done it before with much slower chips. And basically anyone reporting on them guarantees they’ve had arm and A# series macs for years now in the lab. 
How is it on the cap. The cap is to the left of the reader. 
Should have put the level on the wall to prove the earth is vertical. 
Scientifically trolling you all. 
I’d think you’d wanna say that about a car doing 80.  

Most flat earthers have never been in a plane. 
Unless it happens to be in any form of a dock. Such as the standup charger on my desk or in my car. 

iOS hides the content of notifications while locked. While working on Photos on my desk, I notice a notification, I look over at the sound… The phone unlocks and I can read it. So yes, it is very very good at the desk.
But not if they don’t pick it up
r/nocontext 
He’s talking about how similar family members share an iPhone and train it on each other… And it actually starts working for both of them. 

Using the pin code trains the phone. 

My family members don’t know my pin code… I won’t have that problem.
That seems to be the wrong way to plan ahead. Can we at least schedule this?  How about everyone agrees to do it on the first week of April. At least then it’s less likely to be so dangerous, and more likely to be a gag. 
I think he’d be better off installing Linux and running darktable or some alternative. 

Lightroom 5.5 was a much needed speed boost over 5. (As well as a boost in noise fixing, but oh well) 
So can the chrome browser. 
Narwhal is better, if that matters.  But whatever floats your boat. 
No. 
You don’t sound outraged. More like mildly annoyed. 
All of the Apple bands are extremely high quality in comfort, longevity, and looks. 

The amazon ones are visual mimics that only attempt to look good. I’ve bought several from amazon, and gave up and happily ordered that spicy orange from the Apple store. 
Wash your hands + band now and then if it’s that much of an issue. As scary as it is, the OG wash had official instructions to spin the crown under running water if it ever got sticky, and it’s only gotten better from there. 
I’m rocking a case. And just told someone about that spicy orange for this and my watch since they were adamant about Xmas suggestions. 

I want the silicon case so that I can toss my phone on my dash like I used to with a previous phone, and it not slip around. I stopped doing that with silicon on plus phones being an ass to get out of my pocket. 

And the 8 has the same glass as the X. 
There’s more grip on my X than the 6S. 
Aka “how to make batteries crappier for little gain” 

The watch and AirPods are connected full time. iCloud devices are not connected at all unless sending files. So I totally hope that when my iPhone is dying, it’s not busy sending every percentage change to iCloud in case I go check my iPad. 

The battery data IS shared in “find my iPhone” because almost all use of that app is a situation that requires battery knowledge
It shows them because they’re directly connected full time. 

The rest are devices that are not connected at all unless transferring data. 
They should have waited until the student climbed out of the tree. 
>Wut?

He means 3.175kg. 
Unless the numbers are changed... Apple lets you sync 100,000 non-store tracks, and Google does 50,000. Which I guess only matters to people with a stunning number off under the table remixes and live performances. 
I don’t add my friends just to avoid most of that. 
>	pure black mode

Yes. Next non-emergency update. 
Also shared in more Google subreddits. 
ITT: “confirmed on my random iOS version”. 
Because physics. 
Yep, that’s why he’s bragging. The only way to get that combo is to force a downgrade 
A used version of anything anyone suggests, and eventually a used f/2.8 lens. 

www.Lensauthority.com is a good place, I’ve got a couple things from there. It’s the store where lensrentals.com offloads it’s gear. 

BorrowLenses has its own store. 
You say dropped the ball, I say they’re waiting for classic users to age out or decide non-classic is good enough. 

I have a quarter million photos in one of my libraries, what are their storage sync plans supposed to do with that?
For Apple, personally I just export from Lightroom using “open in another app” which happens to be macOS Photos.app, and walk away. They’ll appear on my phone within seconds/minutes, at full resolution. 

Just to fill in the blanks. 
And Cmd-delete deletes all rejects in the current view. 

Ctrl-del for windows?
It’s not for people who want to upgrade. It’s for people who are going to spend on peak stuff right now. It’s not designed for you.


I feel like I was watching an updated old wu tang martial arts video. 
Spoof the watch’s MAC address with your laptop, login on laptop, and your watch will be on the approved MAC address list. 
Overcast is free.   
Also, just tell Siri when to sleep timer, or use the clock app and set the timer to stop media when the counter runs out. 
Spotify vs Apple music.. theres nothing "seamless" about it. 

Siri requesting is like the MAIN feature of apple music. You'll never get that on a Spotify app anytime soon, and probably never at all on the watch.

Written by a Spotify Family Plan subscriber.
Reliability.  The ring doorbell takes too long to send me video. And currently “there’s a problem” when I requested Spotify to play on my tv 20 minutes ago. 


Also this is basically just beginning. In terms of smartphones… Z-wave was the T-Mobile sidekick.. and we’re in the iPhone 4 / Samsung S2 era. 

HomeKit adding software-based security, and Google remembering that they own nest are both going to step things up. Samsung just has to remember they own SmartThings and start promoting it. 

Amazon adding direct Z-Wave support is a sleeper move that helps knock prices way down. I just wish Alexa didn’t sound like crap. 
How early did you get your X.  This first run cover is just a little bit too small. And since their oleophobic coating is so good, I wouldn’t mind replacing it with the same brand.

It’s a slightly smaller than perfect match for the screen, on a perfectly centered install. But it’s just too small. 
HD Glass.. That’s what’s in the photo. 
Because I have a 10.2 6S+ sitting on my bed, and a 11.1.2 iPad and X. 

I’d rather resign the app than run 9. 

Tbh I gotta admit, I’m only looking forward to anemone, Youtube++, and phantom. Smart invert has me covered on dark mode, and is more stable. Even YouTube supports it. 
Annoying? So is using an old OS forever. I’d choose android over being 2-3 years out of date. 

Shit HomeKit, old apps, no watch, no AirPods, no accessory devices, no handoff, no anything… but I guess my icons are prettier and I can almost tether. Weeee
Far more likely that only he said it. 
Sounds like you need to go back to the store and point this out. 
https://www.cultofmac.com/268413/tim-cook-tells-profit-obsessed-investors-sell-stock/
Lost the ability to tell me the charging rate. I had a sad less than a day ago.  
YouTube jumpcut montages. 
You let the dog get the same X phone as you? That’s pretty generous. I would’ve got mine an SE. Guess I’m just stingy like that. 
The point is… This one has an overwhelmingly negative review.
I work. Not in an office. I travel states and work there when I get there. Or separately, I set my phone down in my toolbox and use my watch and AirPods while I do things. I like having a little more confidence of “I can fuck around and not baby it”. 
I don’t feel I’m not “appreciating the design” if it’s got a completely clear glass over the glass. 
Because I wanted all white and clicked safari. I only picked Reddit.com at the last second. 
I dropped my phone out of my hoodie pocket while leaning into my car and cracked the back corner of my rear glass case.  Drop tests are stupid because every drop is different. 
Well the dome story wound down to "oh god oh god oh god" and then it was like .. done, resolved. 

Which was exactly how the stand ended. 

IT’s book ending was written on hallucinogens. 

JFK book’s ending was co-written by his son, and lasts chapters.  Much better. You could tell he was going to try something silly and then they went better with it... Sticking to the actual concept as opposed to spooky. 
The rovers landed on another planet?
Don't worry. The story was resolved in 1 page and very unsatisfactory. It felt like his publisher called and demanded a first draft in two days, so he pulled it out of his ass. 
You're assuming he's American. 
I ran without protection on my 6S+ for the final 2 months of its life, and got a scratch on my iPhone in the shape of an upside down capital A. 

I ran without protection for a week with my X and saw a hairline tiny tiny graze in the screen. It’s invisible with the screen applied. 

This and I baby my devices pretty well. Glass is still glass. We’ve only reached the “my phone can fall in the water for a second, but is definitely not swimproof” stage of life in terms of scratching, as compared to where we are now where I text and change podcasts in the shower. 
The problems with that is they refuse to acknowledge the back swipe in the video, and that I have an X, and that they deliver in April, which will be getting pretty close to the X2. 

Also those people who backed it got ripped off because that tech has been out for years. 
I have an X. So you can tell I’m not trying to be intelligently economical with my choices. 

I’m also trying to make sure I make better decisions. So this post. 
S0 as a pre-order? or later purchase?
Apple stores are almost exactly 100 miles away in 3 separate directions, so thats not happening. Either I do it or best buy does it. So I have to make sure I get what I want.
It's not about breaking the screen. It's about that quarter inch long divot from an accidental scrape, that is just a bit too small to make it worth it to replace the screen. I have apple care but I dont plan to replace my screen for every nick and scratch it gets. 
So it's wider than the screen? Mine is the exact same size and that's the problem.


edit:...  This 1-star glass? Every review says it cracks easy.

https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-ScreenForce-InvisiGlass-Screen-Protector/dp/B075WGQ7J6
Tempered glass screens ARE glass. Barely noticeable. You’re probably thinking of those rubber ones. 
I dislike my day-1 zagg (invisishield) cover, and would like to know if you have a better suggestion. Or to know if they have expanded their cover since day 1, as I really like their oleophobic (anti-fingerprint) coating quality.
How about “excited newbie”
Those aren't in the backup.. Those are in Sync.. 

well photos are if you use iCloud photo library. But contacts for sure sync over iCloud, so they are not in your backup.
It’s 2017 grandpa, get on board. 🤷‍♂️👍
You can always update back to 11.2 over the span of 10 minutes if it becomes a "I need to cash out now" moment. 
Probably #1 because calibrations happen silently, more often than you think. And #2 are preferred as per-device, in case you restore a backup.

Just guesses.
... I wasn't trying to be mean. My problem was due to an S0 I literally gave away after I bought my S3. 

It was a bad measurement tool at the time, with all of those GPS walking length things done way back when it was brand new.

This whole post was "yay everything works now!!"
I've been wearing a watch since day one. I never.. ever leave my phone behind, and I've done over a hundred counted workouts over the years. My current watch is finally counting what i'm doing.  I think I just had a pre-order lemon that was updated in later releases.
all summer i'd randomly get bored and wander around outside for a few miles, and even now I still do that despite the snow... But workouts rarely attributed exercise minutes. 

I used to think it was being stingy and only measuring high heart rate minutes. They're ridiculously easy now, getting over 60 where i'd used to fight to get maybe 17.

Getting streak badges was nearly impossible on my S0.
The worst is standing for 40 minutes, sitting down for two minutes, and then getting a stand reminder. 

That’s almost nonexistent on my current watch. 
well.. sending them Feedback would probably help. Especially with those specifics.. "Enable swipe-back on the single-achievement page"

https://www.apple.com/feedback/
I didn’t change many of my habits.. and I even increased my minimum move goals. 

I had almost none of the badges on my Day 1 S0, and have received nearly all of them in the past month. (Got the 7 day workout week this week because I felt inspired). 

Was my S0 a lemon at measurement?
Back to what? Back to the full calendar view from a single day?

It's coded under the assumption that you'd want to see what you did yesterday moreso than the past few weeks.
I’d rather they suggested it to the person if the person said they were not okay, rather than going around them and just calling health officials. 
Less likely after two posts about it. 
Much less often after this post. 
Bestbuy most likely. 
Ceramic watches are basically unscratachable unless you’re an asshole youtuber. Although the BLACK stainless steel is a good contender for that title.

Plz remove support for it from the compose comment window. Took me a bit to find the post button.  
The top bar disappears if you “scroll” on even a single line, and have to pull down twice for it to reappear. 
A month? I just switched my iCloud account from gmail to my iCloud email address as default. It resulted in needing to sign out/in iCloud on my 256gb phone X. 20,336 photos resynced in under a week. All local as opposed to lost when iCloud was disabled, making it harder. 

Handoff works fine on my jailbroken 10.1.2 iPhone 6S Plus, which I use now and then for adless YouTube and such things. 

I’m sorry if you’re having issues.. but I’m not seeing those same issues. 
Let’s add: 

If a text field shows on Apple TV, your phone shows a notification allowing you to type the answer. Additionally, All iOS 11 devices have an Apple TV remote hidden in control center. 

Battery status of Airpods/W1/Watch shows as a widget on iPhone. Even on the charger (if AirPod case is open). 

Handoff’s best description is that all your other devices show the icon of the app that is similar to what you are doing on other devices. Websites go their own app if it’s installed.   
Reading Reddit on your Mac? The Reddit app is casually on your phone lockscreen, (and displayed in multitasking), as well as on the iPad dock. Clicking it will take you to the same post if you enter it. Get up and go, or sit down and use the big screen in the default macOS browser.   Very beneficial to have your own macOS account in a shared household. 

“Find my iPhone” covers macs, iOS, Watch, AppleTV, AirPods, displaying their location to the best of their ability. AirPods are found by every device pinging them within their own Bluetooth range. 

iCloud backup of iOS creates a perfect clone, down to the last detail, including the correct app version numbers, which are downloaded from the store and not in your backup. Music/photos are synced via Apple Music & iCloud Photo Library, and are not in the backup. 

Everything relating to routing media runs the same interface. Music playing your Bluetooth earbuds and you want to Airplay to Apple TV? Sending your active phonecall from iPhone to Mac/iPad? All one button/list away. AirPods and W1 chip earphones always show as destinations, without connecting in a Bluetooth menu. 

Phone unlocks the watch only if it’s on a wrist.   
Watch unlocks Mac WITHIN 3 feet by measuring time of flight against the speed of light.  I just thought that was cool. 
You mean before what the AirPods and watch added to it?
Have you attempted signing out and then back into iCloud?
What, like this?

I only answered what he was talking about. My phone app is randomly somewhere on page 1. I took it off the dock a long time ago. I probably use like 12 minutes a month, and 60 something gigs
Phones first. Computers second. It comes from a misunderstanding of what these devices would become, starting way back at 1.0
I use nomorobo because their income is obvious, which is by a reasonable annual payment. And because Marco Arment suggested it. 
Edge cases? If nothing else, those quad speakers are glorious. 
iOS 10 added a spam call filter API. So might be worth it to see what apps are functional there. 
I was using them yesterday while walking outside for an hour (damn you Apple Watch badges!!!) and it was 29° F / -2(?)°C. 

Does that help?
Depending on my grip, I pull CC down with my phone-holding pointer finger. 
Search app NoMoRobo to block spam calls. Send them straight to voicemail. 
He spent basically 12 hours a day immersed in 80s trivia. Any IRL social interaction was by accident. And of course the book would follow someone with very good memory, or he wouldn’t have gotten to that point. 
Because it matches standard iOS selection dialogs, despite being extremely custom. 
It means the tabs on the bottom stay where they were without affecting eachother. 
He’s just thinking that if you’re not fighting them, then you are for them.

They had a voyager episode with this exact same plot. A super long range missile, It was just pointed at the wrong planet.
Disney bought it because they’re opening a streaming service. Fox has a fuck ton of TV shows and cartoons that people love to rewatch. They didn’t buy just for a couple movies, as they were doing just fine without it.

Who on Reddit isn't smart enough to have touch sensitive gloves?
There are actually gloves designed for that. Unique fingerprints are sent with each, and you just scan your glove. Totally stupid yet cool. 
iOS is designed to allow you to see notifications before opening up the phone. Even interacting with them via 3D-touch-hidden UI.   
Android is designed to skip the lock screen as fast as possible, and see your notifications as icons at the top. 

That's not a fault of face ID. That's a difference of conceptual opinion. 
Why would you do that. This isn't able to be fooled by a photo. 
Over all, mostly rotation UI alignment errors ever since they introduced all the new dock code (for iPads). 
I was under the impression that it's bright sunlight directly hitting the sensor. I've never had it happen in practice. 
Pull ahead at what? Selling more android devices than iPhones? That’s already the case. 

You WANT a neck and neck competition, as that’s how you get major advancement leaps. Even if you are personally rooting for your own version of a sports team, you don’t want them to not fight for it. 
iPhone owner here. Rarely do I deal with that. Most of it is hearsay, or people who freak out on their phone due to an app being buggy. 

The kind of person who has a triple digit red number alert on their App Store app. 
Android phones get security updates,  not “heres 8.1”.   

That’s a major difference. New software and completely new features & updated UI. For half a decade. 
The major difference is… Apple does all the stuff on the hardware. And they are fucking crushing it in processors. It’s not like they are slowing down. They can do all that computational photography on device, and instantly or live… while google pixel camera requires like 10 seconds for processing a Portrait photo. And the photos on iOS are indexed by the device… You search for bicycle, and you find bicycles.

I can even imagine the A14 or whatever bringing Siri onto the device in airplane mode. 
S phones are always about performance. They always have been.
I don’t know if cosmetic is the word you would use for changing every single piece of the phone except the processor.
Apple likes pushing the idea before the market is ready. Such as wireless audio and USB-A. I just named a year that all ports will be gone for sure, and phones will be more powerful than today's gaming computers.
It’s not that I was saying you were wrong… More just pointing out that it’s a thing. Whether to help you or anyone else. 
They say safety is the main one, and the passenger seat is to the rear right of the driver seat. 
Just because of the order that you were saying… I hope you know that if you edit a photo in a JPEG editor, it’s saved as a JPEG… Then a RAW editor just uses the JPEG.. Not the original file. You can only use a RAW editor if you revert. 
You just delete your “home” and it happens. 
You think we’re gonna bother with computer cables in 2035? Who’s even gonna own a computer? Charge plates in cars will be as standard as current USB jacks. 
S0 had heart rate, exercise, calendar (needs listed?), alert speaker, Siri, sleep monitor, NFC, Apple Pay... and water resistant to the point that the manual suggested cleaning the buttons by moving them around under running water. 

S1 added a fast dual core processor to replace the S0

S2 (same time as S1) added GPS, swim proof, Music from speaker. 

S3 added super fast processor, LTE, and Siri now talks back to you, which is what people mean when they say voice. 

None of that includes the software. Every Apple watch runs the same 4.0 software. 
And currently, Apple is finally rejecting any app update that doesn’t run solo on the watch, where they used to let the developers use the phone as the brain.
I didn’t mean that they competed directly with Apple, but smart watches in general.

Apple wants a world changer, that’s why they’re investing in health like blood pressure and diabetes. 
They didn’t give up on it. They only finished the second watch that was already in development before Motorola was sold.

It’s a different “they” now, since Google doesn’t own them anymore. 
It takes a lot more than a few months to make an operating system. But watchOS 1.0 was horrible. The newer versions (4.0) are extremely different. Apple learned from their mistakes. 

Google on the other hand, accidentally made android wear slower in 2.0, and had to remove features.
The Apple Watch 38mm S1 is 250, and the S3 is 350. Black Friday had lowered those prices. 

The android watches start at less for less, but a few people rave at how pretty some of them are in trade for that. 
Well... You do also get guaranteed software updates and new features. How much is that worth? 

Such as when watchOS 3 added an easy access flashlight button to all prior models. Which prior to that, did not have a flashlight button of any kind. And let me tell you… it’s a fucking game changer and I use it all the time. As ridiculous as it sounds, It’s seriously one of my favorite features of the watch to have a hands-free flashlight always on me.
With Google, you have to experience it in the first two versions or you might not get to ever experience it. 
So their Netflix losing streak is over?
Fresh flowers on the grave on Memorial Day. 
Android choice. That’s what happens when they don’t define minimum required features to have a license. 

You get to have build quality, features, looks. Pick two. 
There comes a point when we all should realize that the first two generations of watches were practice. A public hardware beta. 
The reviews say that the WiFi “bug” during beta testing was fixed before the gold master released. Is that what you’re referring to? Because the current software package for it is quite good. 
For 50 bucks more you could say “what’s overkill?”

Wear watches, you pick and choose features. 
Apple Watches, you get all the features. 

The only difference between the original S0 and S3 is Speed, LTE, & Waterproofing. That’s honestly it, unless you point out that the speed gives it vocal Siri & such items. The S1 (a faster S0) is currently being sold for 250. 
Apple Watch has lack of developer attention… but it has such a good OS that it doesn’t matter. 

Apple is building to be stand-alone. Google built a “why not us too?” and then got bored. 
If Google sold the pixelbook half as well as Apple sells the “disappointing” Apple Watch, they’d be as happy as it gets. 

It’s only good for writers using google docs, or Google lovers pretending its better at surfing the web. Every other aspect of it is a gimmick, including running Android apps. They could have made that work on windows/Mac/Linux instead 
I was referring to the additional features built into them beyond just “I hear things and they’re charged”. 
Workflow is probably the worst option for that. 

Why not an app like Ecoute or Cesium. One that uses the music APIs to index/play your local files.
I don’t think it’s locally stored. I think it corrupted your local cache and uploaded that to their sync service. Send them feedback. 
It’s a 1000 dollar device only because it’s a first for them. Half of it’s tech is still recouping development costs. The same device will cost less next year, and less the year after that. 

As for a headset, they can make up a lot with app sales… since unlike the phone, it won’t have iMessage or Safari. 
Peak humans maybe. 

I only take argument with the word “benefit”, because that will only be the case with a massive improvement with battery technology. Ten generations of processor improvements wouldn’t cut it to make that feasible. 
It already leaked that they’re working on dedicated VR/AR hardware, not using their phones. 

So how does that work in with your dinner plans? 
Apollo 2.0 is apparently coming out with a better iPad app in the future. 
Noticeable? I think that’s more an issue with other aspects of the screen. 700 is only for features of the device that take place within 4 inches of your eyes. 
You want to feel good about your old screen. Gotcha. 

It’s low tech and blatantly visible as such to people you are bragging about it to. 
Retina refers to the idea that it’s difficult to tell the difference. The plus phones ramped it up, and the X is even higher. 

The question becomes... What is peak, or what is ridiculous? Apple isn’t designing for the “strap a phone to your head” market. 
It says they mostly work with Samsung. Cost more than AirPods, and have low range. 


AirPods might even be the cheapest on that list. And I’ve tried them, their range is holy-fuck impressive and they haven’t even released a BT 5 version yet. They even said that next AirPod case supports QI. 
It wasn’t sold at cost, and it wasn’t designed to be mid-level like the nexus phones. 

That flaw? 

Nexus phones were budget devices running vanilla. That was their only strength. I can admit that just fine. 
They aren’t copying the design. They’re copying the tactics. 
The pixel book is a useless consession to the lack of an android equivalent to the iPad Pro. 

*added book
I assume SD and induction charging. 
The pixel book is the definition of both “over engineered” and “because we have/want money”.  It was designed by people who can’t do their jobs on pixelbooks, for people who don’t need a real computer to do their job.  

It only sells because there’s no android equivalent to the iPad Pro. 
Which goes to show that they don’t know their own future plans more than 12 months ahead. 

Maybe the techs do but they should have run those jokes past internal development. 
Having access to the digital assistant are one of the first things AirPods were shown to do. Regardless of the DA’s quality. 
And pihole works on your local Wifi traffic
I feel like avengers should have been the big one, and licensees being the knuckles. 
It’s a 30 second part in the book. And you’re supposed to guess at it. That’s all. 
You think the sales rates have improved that much over the OG?
Forget speed, whatever. 

It’s got a brighter and True Tone screen, ProMotion scrolling, and most importantly, four loud clear speakers. 

That’s more than worthy of an extra hundred. 
You’re comparing calendars?

If Pixel is struggling to make 20,000 a day,     
Apple is struggling to make 500,000 X’s a day. 

There’s quite a bit difference in what’s going on, than to just compare when they caught up.

“Holding them ransom”

It’s from dumb articles that pointed out the manufacturing price of a custom designed 460(?)ppi pressure sensitive OLED is more than double the price of a (same as iPhone 6) 326ppi LED screen.  

They were shocked… SHOCKED that the custom OLED costs more. 
It’s the opposite of “out of sight, out of mind”, and being sexually repressed just makes you quit faster, or never starting up at all.  
In letter? Or spirit?
The newer gen ones are 900 lumens. 
The first photo & thumbnail look like you made a portal gun display stand. 

I had all the excite!
It was always a “discuss how to find things in the app with your friends” game. Finding the features was always a game itself. 
Money. Recognizability. “Click Me!” Habits. 
… apparently you haven’t heard of the 120Hz “ProMotion” that iOS can put out now. It negates the second half of your statement. It’s currently on iPad Pro but can easily be on the phones in the next model. The X currently understands input at 120 (Hz? FPS? Wat?) per second even if it only displays at 60fps.

If you can point out one single android device in a range of a hundred flagships, I can compare their upper end models to it. The 8 has the same processor/ram as the X. 

Android has made major leaps in lag loss, but it’s not exactly surpassing.

I literally just reformat my Apple TV 4K to fix that bug about 20 hours ago. Except it was only using 2 images no matter what album I selected. 

That one-screen feature sped things up, but it was all I could find to solve it. 
After that, then you get the regular prices. 
First ones always free. 
Only a few brands integrate Chromecast. And it’s better external because you can easily upgrade it in a couple years. 
Is there another iCloud already setup?  If so, is “find my iphone” turned on for that account?

If the answer is no, then just go into settings > general > reset and reset the phone to scratch. It’ll be fine after that. 

If yes, return it for a different phone. 
Only get a tempered glass protector. The rubber ones are suck. Good glass ones feel non-existent. 

The main thing to look at in comments is the quality of the oleophobic coating... aka the anti-fingerprint smudge magic forcefield. 
Bestbuy price match to amazon > Amazon
You can buy dongles. I buy updated cables. 
Well go check again! It is!
Have your devices close together while on the password screen.

No I zoomed in on a forest for anonymity. I mean the white “explore” bar disappears. 

It’s actually the only way things look correct.

What a mess. The explore bar is too low with clipped corners. The Google logo and scale are set absolute to the screen, but that is only correct if explore is moved up. And the round buttons are just sitting relative to the explore bar, since I saw them bounce as it loaded in. 

Explore should be turned into a bottom white bar that takes up the whole bottom. Then align based on that. 

Also, explore disappears if you do a search for a city. I typed in New York and it disappeared. 
OP’s title is the same pun. 
I suggest 14 by Peter Clines, and Redshirts by John Scalzi. 

Both are very addicting like RP1, not super long, slightly geeky, and both have satisfying endings. 
Complication is an old Watch term for the extra items on a watch face. A very silly term. 
“Alerts for Reddit” author said no plans for it. 
Don’t forget that iOS 11 can share a known WiFi password to friends just by proximity, if that helps any. 
Carrot Weather.   
HealthFace.  
World time (when traveling. To remember time zone differences)


Currently on a quest for something crossing News.app and Alerts for Reddit. I’ve already emailed the creator today. 
Carrot uses the same data source as dark sky. So that’s helpful. 
Expected meme, swearing, or dickbutt. Instead I got a commercial.  
Son, I am disappoint. 
That’s basically the same time it takes for the iPhone X.  

Two five second head spins and then it recognizes fast. Gen 2 will likely be much faster, and probably come out before this announced one does. 
The Apple one doesn’t have a nich. It succeeds at all of the checklist except maybe week long battery life. 

Saying “get one that supports that feature” defeats the idea of trying to get the best one. 
Welcome to non-vanilla android. 
What are you referring to? Podcasts is built into iOS/tvOS and has always had syncing. Most nitty gritty settings are in the iOS settings app for it. 

If you deleted it, you need to “reinstall” it from the App Store. 

Or do you mean google’s own apps displaying podcasts?  They know that’s a suboptimal experience on their own devices.. adding other OSs into the mix is not their strong point. 
The article says it takes 10 seconds to do the initial scan. And then it’s down to 400 miliseconds recognition after that. 
If someone can get that photo, the owner has other problems. 

It’d be easier and faster for a thief to just use a hammer and their knees. 
It works amazing with hey Siri in a car dock. Since “you’ll need to unlock you iPhone first” is no longer a worry. 
Tumblr
Bet the next one says “War”
It’s fun to MAKE. That’s where it succeeds. 

That and that bohemian rhapsody one. That was great. 
I’ll think about it. 
If your helmet breaks when you get hit, it’s shrapnel. 
Those people are doing it for the experience or for the news reporters. I have a day one X in my hand. No line for me. 

And the 8 had no issues with lines. The X was just having a few issues at the start due to manufacturing issues. #S phones don’t have that problem anymore. 
It doesn’t *exist.  

I only correct you because your statement makes it sound broken. 
Inbox has been so slow that I honestly found myself searching ios mail in spotlight to get at specific emails. It’s now taken inbox’s place on the first page. 
They’re trying to switch to LED lamps that only point down. 
His own body is more durable than the helmet. 
Or cuz several years have passed and they wouldn’t be wearing the same clothes. They have access to millions of dollars. Billions in some cases. 
Doctor strange can fix his hammer. It’s on earth, not asguard. 
1. Smugness at knowing you’re not using the app.   
2. Easier to share video you’re watching.   
3. less of a chance of continually browsing videos since it’s not as smooth
And how many of them are dick ring toss?
Because wanting to work with the photos as opposed to browsing a website is a common want. Some people want to do more than click auto fix. 

The lack of a desktop app for Google photos is what keeps me on iOS. 
*sees middle finger*

SEMPAI NOTICED ME!!!
That setup there is much faster with the cords in. 
The woodpeckers have joined the enemy!
I know. But it’s not very likely. 
Two more inches and you would have proved it goes much further. 
If anything, my circles are stunningly easier to hit on my S3.   

I HATED when I would be standing for the full hour, sit down, and my S0 would say “stand up to get your hour” alerts minutes later. That never happens anymore on this one. 
… what kind of theaters are you referring to?
They have to be on the “type a password” screen I believe. 
What if they have android and a macbook. 
You’re paying for the interface, and the syncing between devices. 
They probably just asked Siri. 
It’s a complete lack of a destination or forethought. 

Apple wants “the best one”, while Google gets bored by version 3. 
And then they’d make a new one 20 months later.


They currently have five ways to message, and cannot contact eachother except via sms.   
Stock, Messages, hangouts, voice, allo.   
All with encryption being a super low priority. 



I’m not alone! 
As a 10 owner, I think it’s just easier to tap the top of the screen. It’s at the actual top instead of an inch down. 
Go to their desk and plead. 
It is a HUGE bullet point in advertising. Even if you’re used to babying your phone, and think anyone who doesn’t is a dumb. 
And a €1000 computer is mid range. Only because people will buy them for €2000 and more. Just because the range is so wide, doesn’t mean you’re only allowed to browse the top end. Think of the top end phones the way you think of gamer’s big rig computers. 

Miniaturization has allowed for a huge range of tech in your pocket. The 5T aimed for speed and ignored other quality of life experiences. Like a speedy car with low trunk space. While the X and Note 8 aimed to be a Tesla super car. 

Side note. I’m American so my brain goes € = $ * 1.3 when I convert euros to real money. 
You’ll do that every time you update the OS and they change the algorithm. Something they’ll never put into the change log. 
You literally expanded my first sarcastic statement with your opinions. 

I’ve used 2x zoom multiple times this (tediously busy) week, and it’s pretty nice changing music and then setting it on the shower rack at hotels as I go. 

But since I also habitually play with a canon 6D, you can take my photo opinions as advice from an addict. And portrait mode on both phones suck. They’re novelties like filters and dog ears. 
It’s not an American company. It’d bring massive monopoly issues to the table. They just replicate whatever they can instead. They’d be better off buying pandora. 
He means to sort your music via desktop screen. 
16gb phones were not on the whiteboard as being for people recording a lot of video, nor iMovie.  Your investment did not match your habits. 

It’s time to attempt to invest in improving your frustration problems. 
Are you willing to pay the extra money to leave your phone behind?

I’m getting my mom an LTE one for Xmas with no plans to activate it as of yet.  
I got mine without LTE. I don’t do phone calls and my watch doesn’t do reddit. 
Rescan your face from scratch in better light. I’m told it helps. It also keeps that for when they update the algorithm. 
They’re currently 99
Try it on the home screen. I kinda figured that all out just by fucking around with it on day one
Using portrait mode on a flat focus plane? 
ITT: “this mid-range tech phone is so much better because it isn’t as expensive as those other phones with their fancy better tech”

The entire article is “the screen is not as good, it has bezels, it’s not waterproof.. etc” and you all want to put it on the same level as the Note 8 and iPhones. 
The calculator app broke because they rewrote it from scratch in swift and the designer didn’t compensate for “ignore the animations if they type fast”
I got one. It needs a few software adjustments because pulling down control center adjustments from the top was a dumb move, but other than that I love the hardware itself. 

And you can find ranty people anywhere. 
A month and a half. 
I love making workflows.  I almost never remember to use them. 
Snip snip?  You assume it has its own wires? 
If someone can get that deep into your system, then they’d place something other than Siri to do it. 
They don’t see it themselves, so they think we’ve caught the dumb. 
Same issue on my X as well. It sticks to sections of the bar. 
I have the same issue he does with scrubbing. 

iPhone X, everything up to current public release. 
It’s becoming meaningless when it’s used in basically anything that is improved by trial and error. It’s no longer new. Bragging that you used machine learning is like bragging your phone has multitouch. 
Thats why he had a sarcasm mark. Nobody believed google saying the earbuds used it. 
Samsung facial recognition was like a webcam scanning the face. It was broken with a Facebook photo in the demo room after the announcement. 

The X’s scanning is nothing at all like that. First, it’s nearly instant. It requires “attention”, and working from angles.  It works in bright sunlight and pitch blackness.  
That and it is OS level, so every single app can use it, without getting any data from it except “approved”. 

The only thing similar was that they both included “face” in the name. 
When they pretended they couldn’t do translate on any other generic earbuds that happened to have a microphone. 
AirPods on iOS 10 started Siri if you tapped them. With optional play/pause. 

AirPods on iOS 11 have a small array of options depending on your choice. 

Currently if I am paused, I double tap either to play. If playing, I 2tap left one to previous track, and right to go to the next track. Which generally translates to skip 30 seconds on audible/podcasts. 

But all of that is ignored mostly because watchOS 4 default displays a now-playing screen for quick access to controls whenever the phone is playing something. 
AirPods used to hold that candle. I’d say my X is def up there. 

And nothing google creates is best. They released a flawed 8th phone (I count the nexus line) and some basic earbuds for it that had nothing special about them. Even the pixel 1 didn’t have waterproofing, while still costing just as much as other flagship phones that did.  

The only thing the pixel line has going for it is a good camera and vanilla android. 
Complaining about Apple getting features after they already arrived is like hearing your uncle say “but her emails!” In 2018.  
Tired areguement. 

I’m looking forward to Samsung copying FaceID in the galaxy S10, cuz the S9 doesn’t have time to develop it. 
That won’t happen unless they eliminate skins. 
All they need to do is release a new line of laptops. MacBook ARM. 
Non-pro models. 

Not A12, but maybe A14. 

Or more likely.. M1
Those poor fish probably think the world is ending. 
There’s no technological reason you can’t have a motorcycle in your living room to take you to the kitchen and back. 

They’re using a super low power chip do the listening thing, instead of leaving an 18 core intel beast on for processing local sounds. 
They try their best. The devices contact eachother until they decide who’s the best listener. 
Everything a HomePod or non cellular iPad can do. 
Unless he has odd typing habits. 
What If
... relevant. Accepted. 
What is that going to do for your google home?
The silicone things are the recommended ones. Litter and rice leave stuff all over the inner components. 
Apple had voice actions before Siri too. Controlled music and texts and the like. It comes back on if you disable Siri. 
I saw a tutorial/“look what I did“ video where somebody broke off the plastic parts with a hammer, just so he could finish fitting them into the light cans in his ceiling
Buy used (functional returned) plugs on amazon like I do.
