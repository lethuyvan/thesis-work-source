Haven’t been called an idiot online in quite a while, thanks for the reminder!
I can appreciate transparent reasoning behind problems, but it seems that Epic is more concerned with new updates at the expense of bugs and outages. 
Epic, why not spend one week bug fixes and the next on new features? At this rate you’re going to run out of ideas, or break the game with the level of bug additions and server downtime.

Honestly this was my mindset about breaks before all the responses to my comment. I’ve learned a lot from people who came back stronger from breaks. 
That’s rough. I’m sorry. 
You’d be surprised how many positive responses I’ve gotten. 
That’s really interesting, never thought of it like that. On the other hand, I know the stigma of military spouses not being faithful during long deployments. I can’t imagine how difficult that must be on both sides. 
Agree!
Wait, so you used the break as a sign to end things? I guess that changes the definition of “worked”, but I’m glad it was the right call!
That sounds like the right way to do a break—not put labels on it and fix the problems at hand. 
That’s great to hear :)
Yeah. I think if it’s used as an excuse to sleep around, the relationship is probably over. 
I’m really glad to hear it worked! You don’t have to answer, but I’m curious if it was a monogamous break. As in, you were still committed to each other but needed some time apart. Breaks I’ve witnessed usually aren’t, and fall apart. 
Uh oh. 
I think that’s a very proper use of a “break”. Breaks to the people around me mean sleep around a bit, which leads to even more distancing (or rarely renewal) of the relationship. 
Totally agree, I know some work. But as you stated, whenever I hear my friends in relationships are “on a break” I assume it’s over. Almost always it is. 
That’s a really interesting scenario for a break. Glad to hear you guys pulled through!
Has a break ever really worked out though? I’m genuinely curious. 

Edit: Thanks to everyone for your honest responses! I’ve learned a lot today.

I had a lot of issues with it. In portrait, it mostly disappeared. In landscape, I couldn't unsee it. 

Additionally, Apple really has weird priorities when it comes to status icons. Who checks their network or Wifi bars more than battery percentage, do not disturb, or alarms?

Haha yes I understand, but that's why I'd rather have a Plus phone with a normal ratio. 5.8" is not better than 5.5" for video. 
Did you read my post? The screen ratio and notch make watching video worse. That's why I returned it. Pixel 2XL has rounded corners but no notch. 
I mean, were in the iPhone subreddit and I'm talking about buying an iPhone. I'd like to stay on iOS if I can. 
I've considered the Pixel 2, but the screen woes and leap from switching back to Android deter me. 
That's wild! I'm sitting at 65% with light browsing and streaming radio this morning for half an hour. 
I think that's the way I'm leaning. The battery life on this isn't the best, but it still runs fine.
My bad guess: instinct? Or maybe Harold the dumbass Heron ate some rocks and discovered it 
Knowing apple probably not

So much producer hate in this thread. I play guitar and piano too, and many producers have classical backgrounds too (see: Zedd). 
Look into free DAWs (digital audio workstations) for either windows or mac, and start playing around. It will take you a long time to make something you're truly proud of, but you'll have fun until then. 
Replace "finish" with "release". 
If you produce background music or elevator music, perhaps you're an artisan. If you produce music to elicit an emotional response from your audience, what makes you different than Picaso?
Then you of all people should understand that art is an expression, and guitars, music programs, vocals, photoshop, etc. are all tools to achieve a result. To say that one tool disqualifies the result from being art is just arrogance. 
*Boosts mids and highs with light compression*
Have you ever listened to a song released in recent history? Almost everything is touched by production software. 
I totally agree, mistakes in art make them valuable. That's why perfectly-timed digital pianos will never sound as good as slightly-off, variable velocity real pianos.
You misunderstand my comment: I'm talking about spending weeks, even months tweaking minute details of a song, when a perfectly usable version was there a few days in. There's a balance between not enough work in a mix, and too much work. I would argue that music programs allow some artists to be "lazy" these days (quick samples, presets, etc.), but the complexity and control music programs have also enable painstaking detail and tweaking. 
The delicate balance between enough sounds to maintain interest and frequency headroom.
*Tries 30 different e-pianos*

Something's off...

*Reverts to original one*
As a music producer, this quote helped me finish some songs. With the power of music programs today, you can always add or change something in the mix. There comes a point where you need to let go.

30-50C is a very normal temperature range, even slightly low if under heavy load. Keep in mind that's up to 120F, so don't touch it. 
See my reply to other commenter. Thermaltake RBG :)
The case only comes with two non-RGB fans. 

The RGB case fans are from a Thermal take 3-pack. They look sweet, but be warned they aren't software controlled. They are relatively inexpensive for RGB fans, though. 

The "heatsink" is in fact a Kraken x52 watercooling AIO (all in one). The fans up front are connected to a radiator, which dissipates the warm water from the pipes. It is a pricey AIO, but the best looking around right now.  
Thanks! It's my first build, but I did my homework :)

I have the Kraken x52. Love the hardware, hate how buggy CAM is. Doesn't recognize it half the time. 
I got mine $450 new online from BB!
I haven't opened that video because I'm on mobile, but ELI-5:

FPS: frames per second
Hz: cycles (refreshes) per second

If your game is outputting 50 FPS and your monitor is a 60Hz monitor, there will be 10 frames throughout that second that will be the same as the previous frame (stutter). 

G-sync will set the refresh rate of the monitor (usually a range of about 40-144Hz) to match the FPS. So if your card outputs 50 FPS, the refresh rate will match to create a stutter-free gaming experience. 
Just checking in to say I have the same monitor, also enjoy rocket league at high FPS, and agree with all your points!
I have the Dell 27" G-sync variant and the colors and viewing angles are really solid for being non-IPS. I paid $450 for it and will likely never go back to non G-sync. 
I just did my first build in late May. I got it working on my first try, and so can you! Although true, you can get everything you need from manuals, do yourself a favor and watch tons of videos on building PCs and PC components. PCPartPicker has a solid YouTube channel and does build tutorials all the time. Hardware Canucks does great case videos, JaysTwoCents and Paul's Hardware do great component videos. I have since replaced my case and cooler already because I didn't research them enough beforehand. 

YouTube search your desired case name and "build" after it (I.e, "nzxt s340 elite build") and watch a few videos. Between all the available videos you should have a good idea how to assemble your future build. 

Good luck and let me know if you have any questions :)

The back animation is really pretty, but the stripe really takes away from it for me. It's like painting a thick line through a pretty painting.

There's two variations: painted, and certified. Painted adds a new visual color, and certified tracks a specific stat. For example, "paragon" tracks MVPs (I think). Certs are really just a way to charge more for your items, unless you're really into tracking a particular stat. Hope that makes sense!

True, but from my experience anti-price guiders are much more vocal than for-price guiders. Bottom line is I'm taking everything with a grain of salt. And thanks, it's been a fun programming challenge.
I'm glad to hear feedback, both positive and negative. That was the whole point of the thread, instead of me just releasing it. The poll says the majority of people like it, but honest discussion in the comments makes the think it's not that simple. I appreciate your time and thoughts!
Assuming buying/selling offers are posted at a similar rate, if a seller posts their heat for 35 CC4, and a buyer posts an offer for heat at 30 CC4, with a sample size of two this model will output 32.5 CC4 as an estimated price. If the seller gets no bites, they might post it again at a lower price, which means the price has gone down. Similarly, if the buyer can't get someone to sell, they may up their offer in another posting, which means the value has gone up. To be completely accurate would require some insane algorithm and pattern-matching.

To be clear, I don't think I'll be releasing this data publicly any time soon. It's very early right now, and there has been a pretty even for/against response. It's more of an interesting modeling/estimation tool more than anything, especially once I get it working for niche items. I've never envisioned it as "the law" when it comes to pricing.
It's a flaw, but how is it "huge"? Prices people are buying and selling for in large quantities will average out to a fair estimate. Selling prices are inflated, buying prices are deflated, unless it's an overpay.

True it's not a stock market, but look how much bio changed in only 13 hours.
It uses typical financial analysis practices to remove outliers. So, a price of 60 would not be factored into heatwave, unless the price was around there for some reason. And as I said in another comment, there it no way for anyone to accurately check completed trades. I cannot access Rocket League on that level.
I'm purposefully not giving away its exact procedure for that reason. From my understanding, prices should not be manipulated any more than what naturally occurs from supply restriction.
Yes, you are correct. That's pretty much the only way to do it automatically. 
Very true!
Ah, gotcha. That isn't as bad, but not sure if I like it since it's not unbiased.
You are correct, I fully understand your points and pretty much agree with all of them. The problem with a mod-run price sheet is that it can be manipulated, as dakilla mentioned in his comment buried somewhere here. Obviously I could manipulate this too, but inserting values into a CSV consistently would require me to do so every hour manually. And at this point in my trading career I have pretty much everything I want, I just enjoy coding and data. I hope a pinned price sheet never happens.
Just as conflicted as I was when writing it. I'll most likely keep working on it, as it's been a very fun and challenging programming exercise. There's still tons of work to do: all platform support, proper painted and certified support, sets, database support, etc. Might look great on Github and my resume someday. ;)

I'm sure it pleases you to hear that I am leaning towards *not* releasing it publicly. If I ever did, I would not want it pinned or advertised on the subreddit. It would be its own site with plenty of disclaimers saying these values are not the law. But that's a long way off, not to mention the fact that I can't host a server on my own.
Thanks for your thoughts! Most of the verbal feedback has been against, so it's interesting to hear a supportive response, especially from a MM. I'm 50/50 as well.
I understand your argument, but I think the whole scenario is based on human nature. Psyonix wants to profit off its users, and traders want to profit off their items. The lack of exact pricing definitely enables the latter, which is the best counter-argument I've heard tonight. However, this ambiguity doesn't lend well for trends, which is how the real stock market plays ball. It also hurts new and younger players who don't understand anything about their items and may lose out.
I agree, by no means would this be a perfect valuation of items. And the way it's built, no price manipulation would occur more than it does naturally. And please see my answer #2 regarding your latter question.
Appreciate your thoughts!
/u/Gek_Lhar /u/LegitCyborg /u/dakilla13190 Your thoughts encouraged :)
Well, I'd argue that trading is a fun way for Psyonix to make money. People want all the items they can get, and no matter what they make money off of keys. 
The fundamental debate in my head is informing new traders about their items vs. undermining profiting. 

Edit: To be perfectly honest, I've had my fair share of underpays from people that just didn't know. It doesn't ever feel right, but definitely gets me ahead.
Companies profit all the time on the stock-market. You can still buy-low and sell-high while knowing prices. The value in this is trends; a skilled trader see or predict whether an item is dropping or climbing, and make profits that way. 

Plus, I've only run into a few people who reference price sheets on Xbox. I doubt this would become a universal standard.

Edit: I saw your edits and they are very valid. I just want you to know I'm on the fence about this myself, just debating for the sake of discussion.
Your reasoning was partially the motivation for me to do this. The biggest (and most fair) criticism I've heard is that right now the prices are off. That would definitely need to be mended if this is to continue.
The MATLAB is just some basic function calls to return CSV data as vectors for plotting. The Python part is much more elaborate.
Let's just say the first option would not make it through.

Edit: Actually neither option would.
Great points. Make sure to vote in the poll if you haven't already.
I can give you some answers:

1. The basic premise is string parsing. It looks for keywords, uses Regular Expressions to parse out data, removes garbage values if any slip through, and then stores the prices in a CSV file (think of Excel). It does support variations of names, examples: "heat" or "heatwave", "bio" or "biomass", etc.
2. I only used data from this subreddit. It was the only realistic option, as RL Garage, Xbox trading club, etc. don't have easy APIs. There is no way for me to know if the trade went through; I would need some NSA-level Rocket League API access to check what each trade window contains, and if both parties accepted.
3. For now, I am keeping the exact evaluation method to myself. I will bring in additional people later on if this is worthwhile, but I'm not ready to release code because it's so preliminary. It's a proof of concept, not ready for open-source exposure.

Hope my answers are somewhat satisfactory.
Interesting, so are the numbers low overall? I have yet to run it for PS4/PC, but that would be interesting to see over a few days.

Very interesting, does your API by chance have a Python wrapper? 
A text dump of new comments from a specific thread. I can get comments from the thread fine, but the output is always the same no matter when I run it. 
Unfortunately, I'm still getting the exact same result. There's been hundreds of new comments on the thread I'm attempting to download, but it still yields the same older comments.
Good idea, I'll try that!
Maybe, but that's what made me laugh about it. *dramatic saltiness*
You as well! Thanks!
Very interesting and nice explanation. However, I would much rather have rocket league tell me I'm unable to join a party based on connection instead of all the aforementioned issues. 
Nice one N8!
Interesting, I hadn't considered NAT types being the issue. How come in all of my years on Xbox, I haven't noticed such an issue affecting my ability to join a friend's game except for RL? And I can understand the party frustration, but I usually avoid party invites because there's usually multiple people in there that start haggling you. 
To be fair, at least on Xbox the invite system only works half the time, and you can't invite someone to game directly from their profile. And even if you get in their party, cars are often times invisible and it won't let you trade. It's definitely something I'd like fixed instead of some promotional cars and recycled item crates. 
This makes me uncomfortable.

Your comment is actually the best case I've heard for switching to PC. 
I gave you my upvote :)
I don't mind this, because it lets me know the seller has an attachment to the item and will more likely overcharge me. 
I do prefer it for trading varieties of specific items, such as painted uncommons/toppers like you mention. It just attracts people that are difficult to make effective trades with (mainly kids).

OP is exchanging his editing experience for clips. Rocket league *exchange*. 
He's actually visiting me right now! We'll play battlefront tomorrow 
If he had a painted toppers I wanted, would've been a quick and easy trade. His argument turned into "you don't know what you're doing because you don't like my offer." Also, I don't think you've ever seen the anything-goes thread.

What time are you thinking? I'm EST.
8 is pretty high, assuming Para (20) Bio (20) and Slip (15), that about $55. And since I'm also buying in bulk, seems odd to pay on the higher end. But yeah I could do tomorrow fine.
Do you take Amazon? I'm interested in bio, para, and striker slip.

Depends on what you have/are offering. I'm trying to use Amazon first.
That's pretty hefty, I'll pass. 
Would you sell it for colbalt almas, lime almas, hypernova, and crates?
What a save! And no they can't be traded, the purple was awarded to those with champion rank. So you'd need a time travel machine and some serious skills to get it. 
Look up the season two boost rewards. The champion one is vaguely purple-lightningy 
Still have the black Uni? 
I think you're thinking of lightning and pixel fire boosts. But lighting is blue, not purple. I have an extra one if you want to trade for it!

Knowing Reddit, I'm sure that exists somewhere too. 
That's the thing...if he traded off his lights it would break the collection. My offer was more of a networking opportunity, in case he knew of others that might have them. He does have white spiralis, I think he's just missing pulsus and discos. 
My buddy has them, but he's trying to get every white item in the game. If you don't have luck I can ask if he knows any suppliers

I meant more $ amount. I have an offer pending that includes one and am not sure how to evaluate it. I've seen ranges from 2 heats to one heat + adds. 
Did you ever sell the striker heat? And if so, what for? Trying to valuate mine
What do you evaluate striker heat as these days?
I recently had a kid offer me his breakout type-s for Biomass. He claimed it was "the best car in the game" and I should accept the trade. 
Don't listen to the other commenters. Looking badass. 
What value are black and white Zombas currently, in heats?
Sell the Zombas for cash in the anything goes thread, and buy the crates there too. Might be more work but will probably be quicker. 
This has been around, which is way traders only use "Friends and Family". 
I really like this post! What a fun way to shop, and also I think painted photons are super underrated. +1

Picking the right kick is important, because it's essentially the centerpiece of the song. You want to have a clear but strong low end, and a punchy or clicky top so it carries through the mix. Other variations on kicks really depend on what genre you're producing. 
Clarifying question, what do you mean by bass? In the context of music production, "bass" usually refers to the mid/lower end frequency instruments, not percussion. Do you mean kick bass, which is the low frequency produced by a kick?
Wow, you're right. Definitely not an inspiration for that song, but similar. Top-line piano melodies are one of my favorites. 
Having used GarageBand on iOS before, I think you'd be hard pressed to get any results close to the industry standard. However, depending on your level of production skill (from your post, I assume beginner) GarageBand might be a great start. Here are some things I would focus on:

- Melodies/chords
- Song structure (intro, verse, build, drop, breakdown, outro, etc)
- Percussion and FX. Percussion is often the most overlooked aspect of starting producers. Apple has plenty of loops, but if you can learn to construct effective percussion sets from individual samples, you'll be on your way

Let me know if you have any other questions, I hope I've helped in some way. 

Edit:

In regards to music theory, I believe it's an advantage, but not necessary. I write all my melodies and chords by ear, and you can [judge my work](http://soundcloud.com/alangeorgemusic) to see the results. If you chose your notes purely on theoretical compatibility and not emotion or energy, your song won't be that interesting.

Don't be so pessimistic like the previous commenter is suggesting. Sure, hair may be important to a first impression, but I know many guys who either shave their hair off or have receding hairlines (like myself) that have quite attractive girlfriends. Just take care of yourself and be confident. 
You're welcome, glad you enjoyed it!

You have a very similar body type to me, at least before my surgery. That definitely looks like gyno.

I know it's past your date, but wanted to comment anyways for future reference.

I barely felt both drains come out. In fact, I was still cringing waiting for them when the surgeon walked away with them before I realized it was over.
Supplements have not been proven to work, and are often shrouded in sketchiness. Surgery is the only sure way to remove it.

Again, your body is going through lots of hormonal changes because of puberty. Gyno [comes and goes for tons of guys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecomastia) (read the first paragraph), it's only a small percentage that keep it long-term. 
How tight are your post-surgery garnets? My swelling is almost completely gone, and I'm only coming up on four weeks. 
Anyone under 18 should wait before taking action, because your body is still going through hormonal changes. But to answer your question, it looks like possibly the start of gyno. But as in most cases, it will go away after puberty, and if not, then seek treatment.

Hey man, fellow producer here. What's your soundcloud?
They mean well, but if you watch their snapstory or hear their radio show you can see they're still teenagers in adult bodies. Pretty representative of many of the producers nowadays though; DJ and party at night, make music and travel during the day. 
Dick move. ^^^Heyo
I think you misunderstood me. I get about 1000 plays a day on Soundcloud. Does this site have enough traffic to where that would be possible (if I get traction of course)? Paying isn't a problem. 
What sort of traffic does it get (I'm on mobile and can't browse it completely at the moment)? I hate soundcloud, but 1000+ plays a day is keeping me. 
Haven't laughed this hard at a Reddit comment in a while. Thank you.

Still sore, and yeah arm movement is definitely a challenge. Getting my drains out today, so that's exciting.

So far so good! Staff was super friendly (and funny actually), procedure was over in a blink of the eye, and saltines never tasted so good after nearly 20 hours of fasting. Pain was more than I expected, but Percocet is helping a lot. I hope to get off it soon though, as pain meds are dangerous.

Also here's an older [picture](http://imgur.com/21cAy5y) I just found and uploaded of me at a high BF, which hopefully can show you my motivation for going through with this.
Hey man, I just got the surgery yesterday, and leading up to it I told a lot of people. 

I don't know your direct circumstances, but I have an amazing group of friends (in college) who support me no matter what. I let them know very shortly after booking it, and I joked about it a lot in the weeks after. Getting a boob reduction, losing my man tits, etc. Just had fun with it, despite how serious it is. Turns out my roommate was getting a similar procedure and neither of us knew about the other. 

Own it, and if you show your excitement about improving your life, whoever gives you shit is an asshole. 
The picture is more flattering than it looks. Lighting in that bathroom is great. I can PM you some less-flattering pictures if you're still raging!
That is a terrible time to try to eat clean...coming from a guy that also attempted this. 
Thanks so much! That's exactly my situation; it's very mild, however I'm still very self conscious about it and am tired of dealing with it.
Thank you! 
Thanks! It doesn't look bad because I've leaned out, but any time I try to bulk up the boobs return in force. I also can't wear tanks because they really highlight it. 

As for lifting, I have a four-day split:
- Arms
- Core / lower back / shoulders
- Chest / back
- Legs / shoulders 

I try to go every day, but college responsibilities sometimes don't let that happen.
A little backstory: ever since puberty I've had a fatty chest, but I didn't think anything of it because I was borderline obese. But after losing 40lbs and a year of weight lifting, I saw no noticeable change in that area. Did my research, discovered what gyno was, got a consultation in the summer, and now it's finally time to end this annoyance!
Oliver is straight funky fire. Their remix of To Ü and MYB are my jams. 
Sounds like Oliver, I dig it. 
So "natural flavor" from the original main ingredients "and other natural flavor" for any additional flavoring?
Completely agreed. I was cringing a bit at how long that scene dragged out. 
Loved:

- The sound design. Especially the light sabers and blasters—it just felt so much more real. 
- The sound track, as always
- BB-8, Fin, and Poe. Felt right at home

Didn't love:
- All to familiar plot
- Ren removing his helmet so soon reduced a lot of his terror
- Rey felt a little bland for being the main jedi. I thought Fin was much more developed as a character 

Liked it overall, more excited for the future movies!

I agree with the latter half of your comment, he's better at Electro and Progressive. A lot of people are disappointed with this drop because it's not what Hardwell is known for. 

Also when he tries big room especially like United We Are, it just sounds like a bad Mark Sixma rip off.
I like his breaks and builds, but compared to other artists his drops never impressed me much. 
Hardwell doesn't know how to make big room, but I'm much happier with this release than his other recents.

It definitely doesn't feel large at all on my tiny wrists.
Ever since I got my first watch (Swiss Army Base Camp) three years ago, I've always appreciated watches. I felt naked with out it, and we spent some good exclusive time together. But I slowly began to want another watch, something a bit more serious, and especially something with a brown leather strap. Don't call the fashion police on me, but it always felt wrong wearing a black-silicon-strapped watch with brown dress shoes and belt. The new watch hunt began. 

Begin a watch newbie, I didn't know much about other brands. Through my research I found that many other brands either didn't look right to me, were too cheap, or too expensive (the former issue might be because I've only been looking at a Victorinox for three years). Also, although I'm 6ft tall and a medium build, my wrists are absolutely tiny. I wear the Base Camp at the tightest setting, and I wear this watch at that setting as well. 

During my search through Victorinox's listings on Amazon (PS, search one thing on Amazon and RIP suggested products), I found many watches that fit my target. But I kept coming back to this one, and although the original price was a bit high, I found it for $150 off (at time of posting), and gave in. 

Couldn't be happier!

I have a friend who chews with his mouth wide open and will occasionally spit on you if he gets too close while talking. We still love him, but damn it can be much sometimes. 
Just went through this; started dating a girl I knew well for almost two years. Here's the thing, at least in my case: start as if you didn't know her. Take her on a first date. Try to make her laugh. Pick her up and pay, even if you've paid separately before. Don't skip over the typical first date stuff, because girls love that stuff. She won't want to tell her other friends, "so I'm seeing this guy now, and we just jumped into it." She'll want to talk about her first date, then if that goes well, second, third, and you're golden. Just think of the friendship as a safety net, maybe allowing you to be yourself more or give you more personal topics of conversation. 

Hope that helps, and feel free to ask any questions!
That fucking music. 
Those commercials in general. That middle aged male actor creeps me the fuck out.

Appendage day
Muscle imbalances happen. Most people aren't ambidextrous, so they'll naturally have a stronger mind-muscle connection to one side of their body over the other. 

Being conscious about such imbalances is a good thing. Just focus on working the other trap more. Whenever I shrug, I use 5lbs more and do two extra reps on my left side because that trap is smaller. 
It'll turn out alright either way, dude. Hang in there.
Did she smash [you]?

Really? 10 is super early around here, midnight is pretty standard.
Thanks! I'm kinda ready for the real-world, though. College has been a blast, but I'm ready for independence. 
I've seen you around here a lot, cool to hear you're an engineer. I try to be in bed by midnight so I can hit the rec before 8, since my earliest classes during the week are at 11. But sometimes (like right now), that time slot becomes homework time. I need to get off the DD...
This is my fourth year out of five, so I'm pretty accustomed to the challenge. This is definitely my toughest semester yet. 
I still make it 6 days a week, but sometimes I have to take unplanned rest days if there's too much to do. Full-time engineering student who's also involved in probably too many organizations. 
Classes are starting to pick up, which means I can't hit the rec until late if I even can make it. 

Update on the dream girl: going to grab dinner on Friday, then hit up this amazing art museum next weekend. 
Thanks! It's all so strange to me. Former obese dude landing his dream girl. 
It's definitely a lot more than physical. I've been good friends with her for almost two years now. But yeah, probably didn't hurt.
Well shit, you're damn right. Quality analogy.

What the hell? Why would they throw a javelin?
Sounds like you're on top of it. Happy safe bulking my friend. 
Isolation. Early and often.

Just make sure to ease into it. Like, take a couple weeks to get up to your surplus ease into it. I started bulking way too soon and got pudgy. 
Not a breakup, but a serious rejection, is what got me into bodybuilding. The motivation was (and still is) real. 
Was the benching guy at least good?
Also going through this. The worst part is she's flirty in general, so my mind tries to rationalize it as interest. 
Everybody binges at some point or another, especially when first starting. Once you get in a serious routine, the motivation to keep your diet on track will overpower food cravings. Keep at it!
Just make sure you aren't overworking muscle groups that get hit heavily at your job. If you can, pinpoint what muscles are being hit directly, then don't work them as much when you're in the gym. Should make for an overall balanced physique if you do it right. 
> no wait for gear

I pictured a long line to get steroids for some reason. 
Sounds like your diet needs a ton of work. Two years and nothing? Did you take progress pics?

As a college student, I walk great distances with my full backpack nearly every day.
I just noticed one of my traps is noticeably bigger than the other. Since I train them the exact same, I've concluded it must be because of years of heavy backpacks in high school with uneven straps. Anyone have advice for such an imbalance?
I drove 20 minutes the other day to the nearest whole foods to pickup some Halo Top. I got all the way to the checkout line before checking the ingredients. Fuckers have the "may contain nuts" warning, and I'm super allergic to peanuts. It was such a sad day, I just want to try it :(

This. Definitely don't stop chest work, but instead focus on your form so you aren't over developing your front delts, which hurts your posture.

You know your cut is going well when you have a nightmare about eating a whole package of double stuff Oreos. 
Pretty much anything by Filous. 
Gotcha. My best cuts were simply my regular routine + extra cardio + perfect diet. Minimal strength loss (maybe -10lbs on biggest lifts)? 
...welcome to college. Hang in there. 
Would also add: your diet is (obviously) more important than ever on a cut. Consider upping protein a bit to ensure starved muscles don't lose strength. 
Fucking crying after watching it
We pretty much share the same problem. 
She was put in a very bad position, and it ended up falling apart. I say rejection, but she did consider dating me for a few weeks, then ended up calling it off. 

I've tried something similar to your method, but I see this girl every day. I'm in my fourth year at a university, and she's constantly around because her house hangs out with my house. We're a group as tight as family, so I can't be upset at her or the whole friend dynamic will be off. 
What if you're already quite good at something, and have a decent following online (half a million hits), but still don't feel worthy about anything?
Real MVP
I had very similar stats to you. Started around 200, got down to 155, and am now hovering around 165 after getting into body building. 

Unfortunately in both of our cases, surgery is the only option. I focused heavily on my chest, and honestly the problem just became more visible. My surgery is scheduled for the 21st of December, and in so excited to finally put this past me. You should look into it as well if it's within your means. 
These are all really solid outfits. Puts my "style" to shame.

So happy to see this quoted here. Love that song still. 
Yes. Your strength will come back quickly as you transition back into a bulk. 
That upper to lower body difference is insane.
I never mentioned lack of strength--being at a caloric deficit will definitely impede your overall strength and energy levels.
I prefer big deficits. As long as you're hitting protein for the day and are still giving 100% in the gym, you won't lose any substantial muscle mass. 
Snowboarding, mountain biking, hiking, and music production :)
This is the correct response. Be the dad that proves society otherwise. 
Found the dude 
Went running today after a core workout with a girl I'm really into. It was her idea, and I want to make this a regular thing. 

But the main goal is to cut down enough to show off these abs/obliques I've been working on so hard during my bulk. I can tell they've gotten bigger, since I can still see them at above 15%. 
Follow up with some before/after pics in another DD if possible! My surgery is scheduled for December (due to class), and I'm super exited. 
I booked my surgery (in the U.S.) for December as well due to school. Glad you finally are getting surgery too!
That was my first thought. If she has the face to match...
Getting this girl I'm into / getting over her. It's been almost two years in the making, so either option would be great.
Yeah. It's definitely not as easy as using your *lats* and *pulling down*. 
My calves shrunk a bunch too. I attribute it to lack of constant weight on them to keep them big and strong. 
My philosophy is to never copy sound design (synths or percussion), as that's typically an artist's style, and won't get you anywhere if you sound the same. But style, structure, and overall vibe is definitely something you can mimic and have it benefit your track.

When I first started getting serious about production, I essentially copied my favorite songs using my own synths, samples, and style. Copying allowed me to learn song structure, transitions, etc., but using my own content allowed it to stay my own. 
Typically for me, the second drop starts with the more formed drop (all percussion and notes), then includes new vocals or variations. Subtle differences can be powerful.

Get your heart broken. Teaches you a lot about feelings and how to deal with them, but nobody should have to go through that twice. 
I'm all over the place. Been producing for 5 years, but only got serious (and decent) in the past years. Trance got me into the game years ago, then I transitioned into progressive/big room, now I'm more melodic and deep.

That coming from a privileged family can cause many issues later in life. Once I was in college on my own, developing previously non-existent work ethic, money-managing, and household care skills was quite the shock. 
Your Instagram says you're a music producer, do you have a soundcloud? Fellow producer here. Nice progress btw. 
Definition is the greatest illusion of size. The only problem is pushing through that awkward "not big but not lean" phase of the cut. 
Spheres: 2 Us: 0
Women have a naturally higher body fat percentage. And even if a guy has a similar %, the high amount of muscle mass a guy has also contributed to "hardness".
Damn this is poetic. 
Ah. I'm currently doing a BS in Computer Engineering. After your sophomore year, you start taking semesters/summers off from class to work full-time at a company. You do this three times (2 semesters and one summer), which equates to an extra year. But you graduate with a full year of experience, which companies really look for.
Thank you much!

Be careful with this one.
Alright well yeah, that wasn't specified in your original comment. Being a slob is different, I totally agree with you. 
It's probably just mental. As a former fatty, bulking makes me feel obese. 
You'll make friends so awesome you'll question every friend you've ever made before. 
TIL. New goals. 
While I agree with you, I think it's also important to respect others' lifestyle choices. I know many confident, outgoing, attractive people that don't share this lifestyle, and you gotta respect them for it. Otherwise you just become that judge mental gym bro that nobody wants to be around for fear of ridicule. 
Not sure what that is, but ours is called a co-op program. 
I'm about to go into my first senior year (5 year program), and am honestly ready to be done. For mostly the reasons you've laid out, but college is just really draining. I've done 8 months full time at a firm, and my body just likes a regular schedule. 
As a starting point, look up the Buff Dudes videos on bis and tris. They have some good form and exercise tips that you can apply to your own routine. 
Also shoulders and genetics. 
Dear god. I can't imagine the site and sounds being burned into your head like that years later. 
I wonder if there's a really terrible subreddit hidden in the mess of it.

Valid, but coming in first against an "older lady" doesn't mean much. Sure she was rude, but that lat-pulldown-dangle thing could have been her dying wish.
My college gym is a casual two-block walk through the student neighborhood. So convenient. 
If you're everything you claim and your guy isn't happy, he doesn't deserve you. 
Isolation is key. Do you have a dedicated arm day, or work bis/tris in isolation on other days?
Nova Top seems to be pretty popular, where stocked. 
Isn't that like 400mg of caffeine? Not an overly crazy amount for a day, but one serving...damn. How did your heart feel?
Checking in to say fuck cutting as well.
Ripped the armpit area of a favorite dress shirt of mine because I don't property fit it in anymore. sucksman
Same dude. Even though I lost 40+ lbs prior to starting bodybuilding, I feel fat af at ~15 BF. Super annoying. 
/r/fitness producing something actually useful? Who knew! In all seriousness, thanks for this. Also, sorry to hear about what happened when you tried to post this.
Hit that winter bulk strong. Gotta be ready for spring bulk 2016.
When you have no other talents/interests, I guess you'd think anything you do is a hobby.
Can't say I've ever heard someone claim how inspiring they are. 
Were there any premier protein tests?
True, but probably not for a guy like me (until I finish this cut).
I'm sure we will man. The one'll come around.
She's not that kinda girl, but damn she's cute.
In my experience, it's negligible. MFP ranges between 100-200 calories for a 1-2 hour lifting session. I just don't count it, especially when cutting.

New favorite descriptor. 
I just started helping out one of my female friends with form/routine, and she's absolutely tiny. Definitely makes me feel way stronger than I am, and yeah the motivation to prove yourself is definitely there.
It's just amazing how you can go from 0 to wrecked when you hear your crush mention someone else. Like a knife through the heart.
She's graduating after this year and I have two left (engineering probs), so honestly I'm just waiting it out. Actually getting rejected the first time is what motivated me to start getting serious about bodybuilding. Not to win her back per-se, but to get back some confidence and feel good about myself. Now I'm drowning in the world of dysmorphia like everyone else haha.
I haven't been tested, but I have the exact same symptoms as you. Except my libido isn't too bad. Definitely want to get tested soon.
You're probably getting a great lower back/leg workout from picking up boxes.
