You can always look up the credits very easily. Maybe he thinks it’s unnecessary.

Hasn’t it only been one album?
No, I’ll stick with the headphones I love to use, and continue to ignore you.

Not to mention other shitty Bluetooth headphones look a lot worse with twice the size and blinking lights all over.

I hope I don’t get downvoted to hell for having this opinion, but I do enjoy his recent music.
I agree he is a piece of shit, and has fucked up, a lot, and I hate his persona for that, but maybe give some of his music a listen? Maybe try using a YouTube reupload if you don’t want to support him in anyway, which I assume you do.

I try to give most artists a fair shot.

And it’s true, the reason I thought of the question was because I was listening to MBDTF, and I was interested to see if I would get a Kanye. Didn’t expect the second response.
Good choice 
Amazing choices.
Yo, this shits weird. This is the exact album I’m listening to. It’s the reason this question popped into my head, and also my answer. That’s insane haha.

Well, 7EST is when the shop resets for us. And yesterday it’s when the thing popped up saying “2 days left until season 3”. So I can assume it would run on this schedule.

But these are slight recolors. What is league?
Holy fuck those are expensive 
Similar to CS Major drops I guess? Connect blizzard account to twitch and it knows when it’s open.

If so I’ll be leaving it on all day.
For $40? Fuck that
$5 a skin? Fuck me, that’s way too much. $2 would have been fine. 

It’s like Black Ops 2 skins again.
So, is it safe to say that skins are 100 each. The 900 will be what? $10? That doesn’t make sense, has to be 5 as blizzard always gives a small bonus, similar to loot boxes in bundles 
oof
You’re comparing the downvote button to communism.

Bro he literally put it on YouTube ~~for money~~

My bad, not for money. But the point stands, there’s just a few things that shouldn’t be broadcasted to the general public, a very large majority of which are underage.
How is it on switch? I heard the controllers were shitty. As in, not fluid movement.
nah
Nintendo game? Easily BOTW. I understand everyone says this game, but I’ve had it since Christmas and already have 30 hours. Had no WiFi but that game kept me going. What an amazing one. Love it so much. Good luck all.

Oh, in the comment you said “BOTW on switch” so it confused me ha.

You’ve beaten BOTW but don’t have it?
Try updating it in settings 
Ah, not sure if I would be interested in that. Might have to return it if I can.
klol
Sorry, what’s XCom? Lmao.
Agreed. Sorry to nitpick but wouldn’t want someone to pass up the product for some misinterpretation.
I’ll always take it as a backup... ;)
Here’s my issue. Got the game for $30, put it in for 10 minutes and had to go. Never had time to try it. What exactly is the game? How does it work? Platformer? What type of battle system? Is it free roam like Odyssey? I understand I could watch a video but I’m currently very limited on WiFi capabilities and need a quick and easy explanation.
It covers the entire screen, what it doesn’t cover is part of the bezel on the sides.
no
Stardew Valley, and I know a lot of people will agree.
Yes
Yes
Have you tried updating the controllers within settings?
In what way? I’ve bought from them plenty, racked up a bunch of points (never used them lul). For trade in sure, but how else?
Seems weird without it. Guess I’ve been wrong my whole life then.
Oh well. Learning experience.
I guess. Hence why I’ve never game them any of my stuff. For purchases I think they’re good? Not overpriced at all.

They organized it like that so well? Damn, I would have thought the beans would have been spilled somewhere along the line.
Depends where I’m going. I have a small case for going around places, going to school, etc, but I also have the deluxe traveler case which I’ve taken with me on my trip to Ireland. Holds the dock, my 4 joycons, straps, games, power cable, HDMI, power outlet converter and switch. Amazing to be able to carry everything with me comfortably. Love them.

Can’t he just redownload it? Or create a new account?
Oh. Just download and play, right?
You didn’t ask any questions. What do you want to know?
Definitely get in contact with Nintendo. I was told their customer service is amazing. Maybe something could be wrong with the cooling system? I know little to nothing around the switch hardware, but contact them.
This is a long shot, but, I know my ripoff GameStop warranty is locked into the serial. So they can pull it up from that. 
I would hope to believe that Nintendo would have the same policy, seems much easier for us and them alike.

I have Rocket League, but not exactly what I’m looking for. Looking for a game very similar to the 2D style simplicity of Soccer physics I could play with others 
Splatoon. Doom? (maybe?) Rocket League? Arms?

Not too sure. I could be wrong 
There’s literally a button created for screen captures.
If the games are physical you should be fine. There is a parental control app in the App Store which is amazing, check that out. I would suggest wrapping everything up and let the kids open it up for the experience. Don’t rob them of that enjoyment by opening it. You’ll be fine :)
You’re right.
I don’t think other game consoles do either?

Edit: I guess the stripe is a thing. Forgot about that.
Ah, you got me.

But for real though. Am I missing out on some free game? I didn’t know there was such on the EShop.
Wait what?

Did I hear free?
Oh you’re just a tumor.

Got it.
Aren’t you a mod there.
Looks like an actual skin. 

Or T-Pain. I can’t really choose.
Possible bomb threat?
Sometime 2018
Yes.

Source: I sometimes play tracer really badly 
I got this for $40 at GameStop. Go there instead.
hi
It was fake
Don’t you get one now and 5 December 25th?
What
Yep. Might have to rewatch the series again soon
Yes they [do](https://imgur.com/gallery/d7sIO)
I guess you’re right. I’m just hoping she doesn’t really, there’s plenty of other characters that deserve some. Hog, Doom, Moira, Sombra, Sym, Lucio
No
Because he wants attention 
She also had one every other event. Including a legendary last XMas
Oh I will, but it gets boring fast. No WiFi, Family doing other things. There will be times I’ll need Zelda
I have a small protective case and then my backpack. For long trips I also have the Deluxe Traveller Case.
Netflix US doesn’t have it?
Anything I need to know when traveling out of country with my switch? Taking it to Ireland in about a week, I have the deluxe traveler case, a smaller case for the switch only, screen protector, power converter for the wall, and games.
Homie this shit December 
Purple star?
This is not what I expected from the title, but, I’ll take it.
Nice 
Are you lagging?
No
Can the cheques be used to get a prepaid card and then buy a eshop gift card? If so, get stardew.
It’s a joke
Do you mean leave it boxed?
Kart is a great party type game to keep with you. Siblings coming over? Mario kart. Family party? Mario kart. Nothing else to do? Mario kart. Since it was free I would just keep it 
I asked him a few months back and he said he had big things planned

What about leaving it in sleep mode in those cases? Been using it in school recently and I just tap the Off button so it’s just sleeping all the time. Should I be holding the button and powering it off fully?
Isn’t that the old Rockstar merch?
Get a screen protector

This sounds good. Very excited.
This is a weird way of linking.
Why can’t you just walk it up
That is what the picture is for 
Was sitting thinking where to upload it to. YouTube takes too much effort, couldn’t figure out Vimeo, dropped it on Twitter.
iOS 11 has a built in screen recorder. I [got you](https://twitter.com/khollywood16/status/936969967043522561)
Wait and see if it comes. If it does, don’t bring it back to them. You’ll be fine. Just be safe and make sure you know where you messed up
Well, I’m 17, about to turn 18, and I’ll be honest I kind of Bullshit my signature. On most receipts it doesn’t matter much but for my license I just tried to make it look cool and sorta legit.
Really mad about the December 1st thing. Post shouldn’t have said that if he wasn’t sure. My entire day I’ve just been waiting, and waiting, and waiting.
The switch is bringing it back!
Neat
Another what? It’s the charger in the box? I just got an Aluminum S3 and it came with the bitch white one :(
That didn’t come with mine. Mine is all white 
Not blurry at all for me 
You could go up to $60 probably. But sell it to him for 50 and call it a day, he’s a friend.
I want that sweet charger.

Any way a pleb like I can sign up for a beta program? Love testing new things!
I like you.
I dig the simplicity 
Same thing happened to me. Water is good. Took mine to a Waterpark a few weeks ago in Florida, Amazing experience. Aluminum S3
Run it under water and turn it for a bit. 10 seconds should be enough 
If the doctor said not to run, you need to listen to what was said.

Contact him and see how you are now. Walking may be better.
Is there a place to hear the sound? YouTube maybe? I’ve never had it
oof that’s bulky. Hope you like it though!
Here to find out how they are. Love my OEM Sport Loop, would love to get more but they’re too pricey.
I like this. Those Discover stories are almost all bullshit , in my opinion. Opinionated and mostly over dramatic. Going to be happy not ever needing to look at them, I’ll just be able to stay to the left side. Super hyped!
Maybe it’s not for you then
You get a lot of free shit
Nope. Always the same. Maybe it was a low battery sound? I’ve never let them get low enough to hear it
Exact thing happened to me. Not badly, but it did
Maybe try cleaning out the Headphone Jack with a toothpick?
Someone could just throw it into photoshop and add a bit more orange

Ah, well I was and wasn’t. Love to see some Screenshots if someone trying this with an X. Assumed it would also work on the 8? They’re on display in store
“Device not supported”
Did it yesterday. Same jsshe
So I need to do it manually every time?

Bummer
You know the controller thing the switch comes with? Even when I connect them into that, I have to take them out and go change it manually
I guess you could say that, but what if someone wants to play Minecraft on the go? Should I take my whole rig with me?
Well that’s just a bad opinion.
Those colors are terrible.
Happy Holidays all! Really looking forward to getting Zelda for Christmas, me and my brother only have MK8D as of now, and there’s only so much carting you can do. Good luck all!
Didn’t he do multiple in a video? I knew he did one on Gabbie, he also did one on Jonah

How 
MK8 was on Wii U
Yes. Lightning.
You’re right, but chances are they could be right, they need to be prepared for any releases 
That’s not a sport loop
How about all the LEGO games? Any you would recommend?
How in hell do you lay your sport loop flat.
Would be a lot better if the part that connects to the Watch was grey.
ColorWare or some basic skins.
Any Watch with a a sport loop will not come flat.
Target said Dec 15th
Yeah for sure. Love the 8 but an OLED would have been dope
The rockstar dongle on the Apple site?
Wish I had an X to try it :(
Make sure to invest in a good carbon monoxide detector.
Yes
Really interesting. Can’t wait to see what happens next.
Must be good material.
So, is this going to eventually start to run back into Blizzard for Overwatch? You can pay money to buy a loot box, for a chance to receive an item. But you are always guaranteed something. All cosmetic. Would this end up at their desks? Is there some way they’re safe?
Obviously not
No. The “you must be rich” part was very stupid. Makes him seem like an asshole. Congrats on the upgrade OP.
Not well
That’s how they come. Laid flat. Some come looped up depending on the band.
oh
He’s just being a dick. Ignore him.
How do you know?
Great movie.
Set it up about halfway between where you need it and your router. Turn it off, take it where it’s needed and start using.
I have one. Netgear. What do you need.
Can’t you just add on a “Guest” account?
Lots of people. My gaming PC and Xbox are on the floor.
It comes with one of those black clips as well. It’s durable enough.
Took my watch to a Waterpark last week. Very happy with the S3 purchase for this reason exactly. Just handy to have that WaterProofing
Well, I don’t have Keys. But, it would be fine. Maybe a bit bulky, but the case is very tough against scratches and bumps.
Always keep it in my left pocket under my wallet. iPhone in the other. Never failed me.
Catalyst Case.
He has the buttons the normal way. Towards the wrist. Others do it other ways.
I believe there’s on in the Apple store. The Rockstar splitter?
Wow, that Watch is huge on you.
I fucked up. Forgot to Copy and paste the link. :(
That’s enough.
No way this wasn’t manipulated by someone, that’s so sick!
Give me that lookin dope fade fam!!!
Oof that third one. Not good there. The others are absolutely stunning.

Edit: the last video, very well done.
How did you do this “stacking” you speak of.
Very grainy, but for a 6s, not a bad shot!
Looks like those jet clouds like your phone choice. (X)
What the fuck haha.
Do it all the time on my Apple Watch. Very easy thing to do.
Ah, you’re a Glass half full guy.
ok
Ew. Looks horrific.
Do you have shaky hands? Could you be double touching the Home button by accident?
Because it’s a pain in the ass
Looks like [this one](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a6/b7/1c/a6b71cf52f9821af8327e964d7f56389--green-paper-paper-background.jpg) to me, could be slightly off though.

I like it. Charge speed is fine I only ever use it overnight. Never slips. 
Not at all. It has a soft plastic ring on top to keep the phone still. It won’t go anywhere

My highest was 51. Neptune, they all came running through the door on the “Destroy the machines” part. They just kept coming. ‘Twas a fun one.
I need the Flash variant. My diamond shovel is the basic variant :(
I wanted to see it. But I also didn’t.
Yeah I get that’s cool and all but it has nothing to do with this post

hey it’s me ur girlfriend

Haven’t swam with mine, just washed it off, but it dries fast. When you swim with it make sure the strap is facing away fro you (opposite of picture) so the water pushing doesn’t open it up.

What’s up with that translation at the bottom? That’s so long. What does it mean?
You really use a 2G? How is that? Is it slow? How’s battery life? Time for an upgrade soon?
It’s correct for me.
What does that have to do with this 
Right side (Power)
Explanation for the dummies?
Just like your mom 
Oh. Well yeah that’s bs. I got mine from Apple so they installed it. 10 seconds in and out.
Buy the band and wear it alone. Keep them guessing,
I have shaky hands.
Yes you need to get it from them. I got it personally because I have very shaky hands, and it looks slick.
What the fuck
I’m sure Apple will make it system wide soon. But it isn’t on the developers, say Netflix had this problem (I don’t think they do), good luck contacting them about it. They have issue to worry about like Kevin Spacey.
I don’t have an iPhone X to experiment with :(
But, What if you Tap Volume Up and Hold Side button? Then hold Power? Would that do it?
Then dump a bottle of WD-40 on and see if it still squeaks.
Almost puked when I saw that grill. Get some BlueTac...
How can they possibly change this through software? That blows my mind, I thought it would be a hardware issue.
Go try it IMO. If they ask about it, play the innocent “I’ve never even noticed that, haven’t turned it on in years.”
What could go wrong? 
-They don’t notice- Free $$$
-They do notice, they tell you to get out ;)

Do it. You won’t regret the upgrade.
So no PC update?
They fixed it
What is it on PC?
And a plumber?

Not really following what you mean, but it still happens with a normal close at times. Shouldn’t happen for a AAA game. If Destiny does it fine, so should cod.
Stopped doing that and it still happens. That’s also how I close CS, OW, Destiny and R6. Never had this issue.

Wishing I had an X instead of my 8. Would look amazing with an OLED Black.
Huh. You’re right.
I’ll trade my 8 for your X. We can do it in secret.
Mine is a solid black. I love black matching items. Black Watch with Black Sport Loop, Black Phone, Black Case, Black AirPod skins, Black Qi Charger. It’s all seamless.

How do they do diagnostics on a single AirPod? Plug in the case I’m assuming?
I’ve seen plenty at the gym. Most are amazed and ask me how I got these “awesome black” AirPods and how they look a lot more sleek.

Little do they know it’s just a skin from Amazon.

Can’t believe you fit an entire paper clip into the Lightning port.

Discontinued from apple, other stores have it. As does Apple refurbished AFAIK.
Like a second delay? I also have it. Could be to allow Double Click. Needs some hesitation to assure you don’t press again.
Usually after a workout I’ll come home and run my Watch and Sport loop under cold, fresh water. Drives my mom crazy, she stands by the idea anything with a battery shouldn’t be near water, it’s funny actually.
What
Depends how you dry it.
By getting AirPods or other wireless earbuds.
David has said Heath and Zane did coke when he first moved over. No one can say if that’s true but they seemed embarrassed about it. I forget the vlog.

Just really hoping Post stays away from him. There’s other people he could stream with.
Couldn’t be because they’re quickly taking a snap of something they 100% shouldn’t even be near?
God I hate Summit. Nothing good about him, he isn’t funny at all. He’s just good, and not very good, slightly above average good.
Post it here as a comment. It depends what it is.
I would be worried that would break them somehow.
A bunch of the kids within our school have started vaping, and the school has delegated teachers to stand by the bathroom doors and only allow a certain number of students in at a time. It’s juicy.
Uh, I have [this.](https://imgur.com/gallery/T31zs) not too sure if anyone would like it, but its a butterfly i took a picture of.
I do believe for T-Mobile you may have to request for the device to be unlocked after paying in full. But other than that you should be good.
How would it be Unethical?

And really? So I can’t just go in today and get AppleCare for my Series 0 Apple Watch anymore?
Awesome 
I absolutely love my 8. Don’t regret it in any way.
I don’t mind paying for Lootboxes. After about 300 hours a few dollars doesn’t go unnoticed, such a good game deserves some money. DLC I hate, giving extra fun for a high price is terrible, skins don’t give me fun or excitement, just bragging rights, as it should be. But as we still buy, they create.
Yes, an ear is an ear, but it’s yucky.
Nice to meet you, Mr Gates.
That’s a Username.
Turn off background app refresh?
It’s your decision. Is the features worth the extra money to you? We can’t say that for your financial status, only you would know.
Wait. Doesn’t it have one in settings? Also, what would you use it for exactly? I’ve been wondering how they’re useful.
I would probably have to disagree. Nothing game changing.
That would be so amazing. Everyone has a phone, Imagine the games we could get in.
Is it on their “Order Ahead” apps?
What
That’s actually super awesome. Makes a lot of sense, and a good way to get people moving. Bravo!
I have never lifted. Just want to lose weight. What can I do? Treadmill? Bicycle? Elliptical? what’s the best for slimming down exercise wise.
Same here. Sleep with it every night. Loses about 1% per hour while sitting. I sleep with it nightly and it’s so much nicer to wake up with a nice touch instead of a loud **DING DING DING**
I’m sure there are other small things, this is all I currently am aware of.
It’s the OS
You can get a Bluetooth adapter.
Seconded. Change all passwords as well.
I know this may be a long shot, but how about Smartwatches?

No Reddit apps I have seen allow me to look through on my Apple Watch.
The Series 3 is blazing fast and has an amazing processor, if I was able to browse through even some r/popular or r/All posts on it, that would be amazing.

Given, I’m not a developer, I have no idea if this is even possible. I really just want to hear you take on the whole thing.
I get the feeling it didn’t change a password by itself.
Wow, what a deal.
Don’t most gyms have free WiFi?
I have owned a 6 and an 8, so I can’t say for sure. But try reboot? This shouldn’t be happening. Are you also charging at the same time?
That’s awesome.

You’re right. Don’t do that.
Gonna take a guess and say for $5 it sucks 
I would hope LD wouldn’t do anything with him.
