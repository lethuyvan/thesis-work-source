The trilogy bundle is one game with all of them together so I doubt you'll get a discount.
I noticed mine was quiet too. It's fine on headphones though.
It's up!
Waiting too.
Is it 3 separate games or 1 game that has all three? 
Plus all the required reading homework!
I know right? 
A little late but....

My friend:
Hey I think there is something wrong with my test results can you look at my version of the test / Scantron?

Teacher:
I cannot. I shred all paperwork after I grade them.

Me:
Lol..wut...
Yeah I'm thinking of one piece pirate warriors 3. Didn't think it's was going to get localized at all.
If I buy a game in another region and it gets released locally. If I redownload the game locally will my save file still continue?

I remember when season 2 felt so far away.
2Pac's Resurrection had huge sales, because it had the big media push for the joint Biggie and Tupac song that accompanied the album. 
Supposedly this is Kanye chopping and finding samples and him going back to the basics. He was negotiating deals to get access to full catalogs for sampling purposes.
He says he quickly found out some friendships were there because of business.
Honestly Rich Chigga was kinda dope.
Haha damn

I want this game, but I haven't even picked up Odyssey yet and on the road to facing off with Ganon. This is going to be a Spring/Summer purchase sadly. I love the streak of games, but as a working parent it's hard to keep up.
I contacted Google and they said they're sending them out in batches. I just got my code the other day.
What happened to Mos Def?
He said that it wasn't his time. The people wanted melody over rhymes. Now that things are shifting back to rhymes he's getting his release.
Pretty lucky, I thought he stopped doing sound checks.
Bruh upvoted
I asked him during a Spotify AMA why it wasn't on GKMC and he said "Sampling issues man...." IDK
Sampling issues will be difficult for release

Have you considered power engineering? Very little programming required in this field. Can do utility or building design. Recommendation is to get exposure to Revit or AutoCAD if you're interested.

Nice thing about this field is that you can jump in straight from a BS.
Yeah sway sounded like he was joking though

I got the neon bundle
Mine came in on Monday
Mine shipped yesterday
I bought he gamestop bundle as I was tired of looking around for it. If you could spare the extra $$ or you were gonna buy the games anyway could be worth the time for you.
Yeah I figured my time looking for the unit and peace of mind outweighed the price difference. It wasn't too big of a price difference either to MSRP.
The gamestop near one of my offices said that the shipment is via UPS and they are not guaranteed a time and that it can come anytime from open to 5PM.
The other bundle I got had shovel knight.
I really cannot believe how many iterations of this song existed before the final release.

Google play is underrated. Sometimes we get the music before other services. We still had blueprint and reasonable doubt way after Spotify lost streaming rights.
Too bad he couldn't get the clearance for it. Makes you wonder how it would have fit on GKMC.

They pretty much said black star was meant for live performances.
Automatic numbering, consistent table formatting, easier to manage keynotes of sheets with multiple views.

I've dealt with keynote corruption where you could lose all your keynotes. Also if you are on California with OSHPD you have to keep track of the changes on your sheet... If you delete a keynote it automatically renumbers... Different people have different opinions on that.


If you're going to have the same note on every sheet you might as well make it a sheet now or a general note IMO.
Yeah I watched the live stream on periscope for the 2017 changes. It's going to be like a regular editor that you can bold underline and italicize. No more zooming that will mess up the text.

Yeah you can get in with a bachelor's degree.  You will need to learn AutoCAD and Revit to pick up some drafting skills. Have a good base in circuits, pick up some power and power distribution courses and you'll be off to a good start.

There are plenty internship opportunities so you can get a taste of the industry if you like it. It will help you understand the systems that are put in a building and what is required on a day to day basis.

Which one? // Which one?

I've been to a bunch of Kanye shows, but I've never seen any of the Bad Boy artists. I can only do one.
Rights. Eventually rights do not get renewed. Albums go out of print. Better get the music you like while you can.
My friend is a structural engineer who finished his masters 6 months ago and was telling me that everyone one of his colleagues has their masters and that you basically need the masters to get hired. Then again there are internship programs that you can get while in school that can turn into jobs... Then you can take advantage of getting your masters subsidized by your employer. When there's a will there's a way as the old saying goes.
That's some mood music.

We had no idea. When the songs were released people were excited because when Run Away was performed on MTV it was apparent that they were making these track and releasing them as the following Friday Pusha T referenced his performance.

Christian Dior Denim Flow and Christmas in Harlem was also released after the album's release through Good Fridays. 

I believe Kanye took all the criticism for each of the tracks and polished them. Monster was originally meant for WTT, but he took it for his album after all the hype following it's release.

Also....it was weird to have almost every Good Friday track feature Charlie Wilson it was like he was living in the studio at the time.

One song a year :(
Yes. What you are describing is correct. I even called nelnet a couple years back and they confirmed it too.

You have to include the amount of money that was required to lease the space. I'm sure it's not cheap $/sqft to lease a space in SoHo.

Then you have to pay all the consultants who are designing the space their chunk of money to spend time designing. That's the architects, MEP, security, Av, acoustical, and structural consultants. Their fees alone could rack up a million.

Then we have the cost of the actual material that needs to be shipped and stored on site and the cost of the construction team to manage the site while people are designing or on hold if design is delayed.

Depending on how busy the area is has X multiplier on the sub-contractors fees.

I wouldn't be surprised if there were unknown factors that were thrown in...unseen existing conditions in the building...someone wanting to have a signature design piece Incorporated in the space...programming changes...etc

You can see the money quickly adds up as each team gets their share of the pie.

I definitely got the first string of CDs released and has the live version on it
Which album has Common performed front to back years later? None other than Be. That speaks on how well this album is received.
You can tell from the whole process that this was organic and natural. Common was in the zone. I remember watching the DVD extra that came packaged with the CD and he was picking out just the cover art. Common was trying to capture the naturalness and happiness he was feeling for the album.

Link of Common picking cover: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygft6eV6OIk

Kanye talking about the making of BE:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9zCuS-u21A

This is one of my favorite albums of all time. There was a hype train leading up this album. I was reading in the Source and Scratch magazine saying that this was going to be a GREAT album. Scratch even featured a verse from Chi City to spawn the rebirth of Common.

Within a short period of time we had Kanye, John Legend, and Common releasing albums under this Getting Out Our Dreams imprint. It was a start of something new and creative.

I know right. California is even requiring finger print scanning now.
Hard to follow Tink, they should have placed her last. I'm surprised they made this the first cypher this is the one I was looking forward to the most.
What was it like touring with kanye pre-dropout days? Do you mind sharing a story?
Saw him live for the Yeezus tour. He played with a live band that I felt didn't translate the music well. Combine that with a with him experimenting with his love performance and you'd see what people are talking about.

He's improved based on this performance though.

This album was a stand out in so many ways: Content, Sound, Topics, Style, Presentation, Flow.

People have to remember that this came out in a market that was heavily saturated in Gangster Rap music. The only thing coming out were songs talking about violence, misogyny, popping bottles, being a pimp. Kanye threw it all out the door with his backpacker look and topics regarding the middle class and thoughts on education. His flow was unpolished and you could hear that was running out of breaths on so many songs. He had a lot of witty lines and a lot of songs that were highly relate-able. 

No one in my town was talking about Kanye until Jesus walks started getting major play on the radio. Even then whenever I talked about Kanye West it was more played along the lines of "Oh that guy who raps about Jesus" (in a making fun of him sort of way). It didn't help that he created 3 videos for this song that for the most part looked like a parody with Jesus stalking a kid and doing jump rope.

Remember Kanye was the hot producer of the moment. When his album came out, critics were saying Kanye kept all the BEST beats for his album. If you had a chance to hear the original College Dropout with the brown cover, you would hear the unbalanced mixing. The remaster fixed alot of the level issues.

No one in my town was talking about Kanye as a rapper until Jesus walks started getting major play on the radio.

It didn't help that he created 3 videos for this song that for the most part looked like a parody with Jesus stalking a kid and doing jump rope.

Was this album ground breaking? I don't think so, but it was a start. A start to consistency. It was an album that brought something different and unique and was is something that we can relate too probably even more in today's climate. We have to remember that even Kanye didn't think that his career was going to last as a rapper. He proclaimed that he would complete the college trilogy and be an exclusive producer for the rest of his career.

Obviously things have changed and the rest is history.

Is this what Crystal Meth was supposed to be?
I feel bad for Tinashe she could have used the promotion. She's so slept on.
If your job does not require someone to sign off on documents then I would say you probably do not need it. However if you decide that you want to switch careers or industry down the line a PE will be useful since you may never know when you'll need it or when it will be a requirement.
Just the rap charts. Even the rap/r&b it was #3. The hot 100 it was #17.
We also cannot forget the accapella album that was sampled to bring hits and spawned the Grey Album by Danger Mouse.

Also the Good-Bye concert at Madison where he he sold it out within 5 minutes....which may be a hip-hop first to sell out let alone in record times.
PSA is the anthem. I get hyped every time that song gets played.
STOP THE TAPE......NOW REWIND THAT!
I went through the bus lane on accident. I was only charged the toll fee. I had a fastrak and it was my first offense. YMMV though
1. Eminem originally toyed with naming the album¬†Amsterdam.


2. ‚ÄúKim‚Äù was the first track Em recorded for the album while he was touring for the Slim Shady LP.


3. Em first heard what would become the ‚ÄúKill You‚Äù beat while he was on the phone with Dre and he overheard the instrumental in the background.


4. The 45 King got the idea for the ‚ÄúStan‚Äù beat while paying bills, and he recorded the sample from his television.


5. Em and Dre submitted the album to Interscope in March 2000, but Jimmy Iovine said it needed more. ‚ÄúThe Way I Am‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Real Slim Shady‚Äù were the result.



Nicki's monster verse was toted as Verse of the year when it came out. So many people were spazzing out at how she came on the track.

Even Kanye said he had to let his ego aside to let Nicki shine on the record. If his ego got the best of him he would have removed her verse from the song.
So much for breaking the stereotype that he claimed he wanted. I'm assuming its the label pushing for this.
I thought it was amber too
Great album. At the time of the release I just I didn't understand the love below outside of the radio singles. It was just so far left at the time. I remember burning CD copies for my friends and they loved SB and thought TLB was just plain weird.

Its funny how the landscape of music has changed that TLB fits in more with today's music. SB bangs, but TLB shows how much ahead of the time the music was.
Makes you think he doesn't have many stories.
When Pharrell said we were getting Snoop DOG I was expecting more bars and less singing. Having said that this has been a fun album to listen too. It sounds like Snoop had lots of fun making it and it doesn't sound forced.

This is backyard BBQ music. I hope Kanye takes note!
Me too.
I believe if the crowd was kept being hyped up they would have kept going. At San Jose the crowd died down after the 3rd or 4th time and they stopped playing. Some peopple claimed that they played it more than 11!
Excited for Tink, but this sounds unpolished. The transitions don't really work for me.
I'm sad cause I lost my OG copy of the college dropout with the brown cover. I know it has bad mixing but its weird listening to the remastered version of you be been listening to something different.
Yep. She's obsessed with her own booty lol
This is him with clothing right now
Jay favorite line, "Dog in due time"
I always thought Cash Money was a dead end for him. At the time of signing, cash money was already over crowded with huge roster of artists who were bigger than him. 

What attention would they give someone who hadn't really made any hits. His days as Mr. 106 and Park were long gone.

Good riddance. Hopefully he reevaluates his music and gets back to work.
People were definitely calling him arrogant. The rants back then didn't help either. I remember when touch the sky didn't win video of the year he was like.... Yo I spent X dollars on this AND HAVE Pamela Anderson AND you STILL won't give me VOTY!?!?

So many people were too scared to help me when I lived in Japan and I spoke Japanese. Part of me thinks it's because of my American accent and the fear that they would have had to try and understand English. This was in Tokyo by the way.
I too was disappointed
I think you probably just notice the voice of the complainers, because the people happy with the app don't say anything. I remember a time when people were begging for SMS integration.

Personally I have group chats with all my friends through hangouts. PC use makes it convenient to chat at work or device that has hangouts installed.
Such a huge cast!
Frieza is coming back?!
I was so excited back then with those two releases and the rumor of them of them doing a collab album. 

Too bad Jay is flat out saying no to the collab. I bet the story would be different if Nas was selling better commercially.

I feel like the Jay and Nas collabs don't get as much love as they deserve. Sure they may have not lived up to our expectations, but we set the bar up really high.
Great album. Got into this after the Beautiful Struggle. Kind of wish he had more collabs with Kanye. They always brought the heat.

Also how huge Captain America is compared to everyone else.
Did you see her interview with Angie Martinez? She broke down crying on the the show. She said if it wasn't for the fame and industry she would have been married and had kids with dude.

I subscribed to Amazon/Google Play and I watched TWD, GOT, and Breaking Bad during the current season to watch the newest episodes after the day after they aired. Price point is $2-$4 per episode.
Can you buy just that one TV series as they air or a per season pass via Amazon or Google? That seems to be much cheaper in the long run and you get to keep the episodes if that is the only show you are watching.
Thinking about lifetime membership. So far it seems like the best method I've used on the go that is dynamic enough to keep the learning interesting.

Wasn't this the Hip-Hop is dead era? We had a lot of greats trying to promote that hip-hop wasn't dead...then NaS dropped the album.... I agree that there were a lot of music that came out from the majors that were clunkers.
Who?!
Let the karma rain down
That may explain it. I saw the tranqs go off and the mission was completed. Didn't think that it could have died when it got hit with the trans bomb.
I was able to carve from a trapped monster last night. I didn't think it was possible. It was a regular double hunt and we captured both monsters. I was only able to carve the second monster though. Fluke? Idk

I was prepared for a rick roll
I had a hard enough time jumping from Spotify Premium to Google Play Music  AND Google Play Music was cheaper at the time. 

I knew GPM was going to have less music available, but I knew I was paying less for the service. I don't know how I would feel about switching to a more expensive service that may have LESS music.
Togarashi, Nanami, or hot sesame oil. You have the winning combo.

How do you split screen?
I only use HDR+ and have not had any issues with it.
I notice the error happens if I leave my phone on too long. Eventually when I unlock my screen the background doesn't fully load and will stay that way until I reboot my phone.
Thank you for your reply!
Thank you for your reply and putting that into perspective!
Yeah I was looking at the schedule and it was Wayne then Nicki then Tyga back to back to back.
How'd she get her album released but not Wayne?
Why poke a hole in the egg?
I got it the day it was announced. I was pretty pleased to see it out so fast.
Sobo is very nice and was my go to spot in the East Bay for a while. They used to have groupon specials where you got a large carafe of their soju cocktails.

I'm glad that they added a spicy black tonkotsu. That was one thing that I always added on their recommendation card.
Thanks, I added. I have slight burn in on the soft key navigation. It's barely noticeable on a grey screen test. So I put NO under burn-in.
Looks like they cut it off right before Redman was about to go in :(
He hasn't been the same since he cut off his dreads and people started claiming hip hop was dead.
This was confirmed with the Root's Picnic. They were simply asking for too much money to do the festival and The Roots wanted to keep their ticket sales low so they nixed OutKast. (ticket prices would have rose 100-200 to just have OutKast on the bill)

The whole tour was just a giant cash grab.
The S series has been one of Samsungs Flagship phones for years...
It was raining today and I had my phone in the coat pocket. Bent over and it feel out of and fell flat on the screen and bounced around. Glad I put a cheap case and screen protector. No nicks.
So much in following the Blueprint model of not having many features. 

Jay had 3 features: Eminem, Jay, Mary. Two were for hook purposes.

Edit: Forgot about Biz Markie on the hook.
I have a suspicion that we won't be seeing the footage for a long time. Kanye claimed that Glow in the Dark Concert video footage was done when he was doing the tour, but we never saw anything out of it.

I have a feeling he's going to be releasing these when he retires to ear some extra money.

Does anyone know how long it took for the Michael Jackson's various tours to be released to the public for sale?

Edit: a word
I don't have it. I remember watching this video where they were trying to eat as much sushi as they could and one guy was getting sick and he complained that his urine was getting cloudy
What if it gets cloudy?
Have an up vote dear chap! I'm sure it'll come soon. The delivering system seems sporadic.

Did anyone get billed for it yet? Haven't seen it on my card yet.
Your order number is: 4143xxxxx

Order date: 06:00 AM PST

Order status: Being Processed

UPDATE: SHIPPED
Ordered 6:00AM PST and called the service rep and the automation message said estimated delivery is 11/25. I had 1 day shipping too so IDK if that has to do with it.
Thanks. Trying to add a line to an existing account.... So I guess that's considered new? I'm done for tonight. Going to try in the morning :(
I can't add a new line and order it? I can see it if I am upgrading though?

Remember when people were confused about How to Love being the super radio smash to be waiting for?
I remember Kanye saying in an interview that he was so nervous coming back that he ended up doing the song faster than normal.

It was crazy how he took the input about how much we loved the MPC on song that he added it to the final version on the CD.

Also...we cannot forget Good Fridays where the next friday Pusha was talking about his SUIT!

I wonder if this is related to that one post where the person said they were moving to the Bay Area but keeping their third world pay.

Oh yeah sorry, I gave you the SD pricing! If you commit to the full season they'll give you around 5-10 cents off per episode.
Just buy the season off of Amazon cost me $24 to get access to the whole season as they come out.

Wale can rap his ass off and had great songs at the same time. He is so underrated.

It's sad to see him leave ROC nation. Right when the roster was looking killer too. Maybe he's worried about being a priority?

He say's Blood on the Leaves as track 1 would have made the album more like-able. I doubt it. The whole album was another 808's where it was vastly different form his other works. Definitely much harder to get into after coming from MDTF where it was the culmination of all the albums before it.
I always have this feeling since WTT that they are saving their features for each other for the sequal. Then again, Jay kept confirming, but Ye hadn't really said anything so IDK.
What does rubbing do? Releasing the scent with the increased heat? Or are you spreading it too much?

I bet Kanye has this verse in a vault somewhere watch it pop out of nowhere.
That was the only line that stuck out on first listen. Glad you pointed it out.

We will probably hear in 3-6 weeks.
They open at 11 am. 30 minutes in there was a long line. There is outdoor seating. Not sure what the demand will be like a few weeks out. Good luck and let me know what you think!
It was green onion. You can see the other ingredients in my ramen Instagram account. http://instagram.com/p/p4W5UckTZn/
You will be paying around the same amount. I enjoyed this more than ramen underground. Portions are smaller here. Keep in mind they have 5 ramen selections. Most of them are shouyu based.

I've been looking for sun noodles. Where did you get them?
Sadly no, I meant to say that they were able to score Shinsengumi on the Socal list. I'm surprised they weren't able to get a big name like Orenchi to participate. I guess Orenchi is already packed as it is, having a discount would be pointless for them.
Same feeling. 
I hear for places with the lamp heaters that after 10 minutes they are supposed to trash them.

Right? You are just dehydrated from all the liquor and pissing you did the whole night before.
Yeah I happen to miss it every year, but they always get Orenchi down there every time from what I've seen on the flyers.
Santa Clara is right around the corner from San Jose. Haven't been to the places listed so let me know how it is if you go.
Some NorCal and Vegas Locations too. Surprised at the lack of big names for NorCal since they were able to get shinsengumi.

There were original talks when you and Jay officially squashed your beef that you guys were going to do an album together. It seemed like the songs that you guys did (Black Republicans, Success) just ended up on each other's various projects. 

Was this true? Or were the various songs a just moments that you have collaborated and just ended up on whom ever's project session was happening at the time?
I have tiny hands, and I have to reach my thumb over usually leaving the rest of my fingers barely touching the bottom of the CPP.
Kweli has stated in an interview that Hey Mama was Pre CD days and that Kanye always had it planned to be on his second album.

I remember hearing on MTV when LR dropped that Hey Mama was a favorite in the studio around the CD era.
"Recognizing that with an increasing number of industrial, institutional, and other campus-style distribution systems, the service point is at an owner maintained substation and the conductors extending from that substations to the campus facilities are feeders (see definition in Article 100), there has been an increased focus on including rules in the NEC to cover these distributions systems." - NEC 2008 Handbook.

There are programs that help recover data on erased SD cards and USB sticks. Not sure if it works with cards being rewritten with NEW data though.
Monster Hunter is one of those games that you can pour hours into it. I had MH3U sitting on my SD card for a while and just started replaying it. Easily in headed to the 100+ hours in the short run. So the dollar per hour will be worth it.

Also, I find it very hard to play without the CPP. YMMV, but definitely worth the purchase.
The game gear was also the consumer of batteries. I couldn't keep that thing charged at a doctors visit.
Nick Cannon is full of jelly.
Romance Daaaaaaaaaaaaawn
How would you envision the hangout going?
No problem. What did you do to fix it?
Since you have it enabled in the game, I would try closing and reopening the game. Upon opening the game it should prompt you to confirm connection to CPP. Press the R trigger button on the CPP and it should be enabled. 

Are you not getting that initial step to enable it?

My CPP was plug and play for me.

Maybe try calibrating the Circle Pad Pro under game settings also. LMK if that doesn't work. MH3U is awesome and just started getting into it, so I want others to enjoy the game as well.

I was in the same boat. Has to hire until I got a white hero. Things are easier now with relay street pass now. That's probably your best bet for finding a white shirt.
I liked your page! PM for you!
No question here. Just a bunch of thanks for your incredible work.
The Pack came to my school and had sorority girls twerk in their underwear, while others were used to roll blunts on their backs. This was all done in a Fraternity house too.

It tracks streetpasses via Pokemiles that can be exchanged for items in game.

I was on the phone for an hour saying No, I want to cancel and I'm not interested in any new offer to every question they had.

They're real sly with their deals, they say they are going to take you off the list and that their is another deal to sign you up for. If you aren't careful, you could get signed up for new deals.
I was accidentally signed up for shoppers advantage last year and it was a huge hassle to get out of it.
This was the fix that got things working for me. I'm surpassed that this wasn't any where else on the internet. Thanks you really helped!
She already completed the puzzle panels.
Her system is up to date, I compared it with mine and tried to do a force update on her system. The same goes with street plaza.

I'll double check to make sure.
I should have added more to the OP. She completed all the original panels.
Do you mean by going on the internet browser on the 3DS? I already set up the system with our internet and she has been able to get on games to play animal crossing online and download from the eshop, unless I am missing something.

The idea to keeping the walkers on the fence was to use it as a natural defense against outside humans. With walkers without jaws to keep the zombies away, it would lose the natural deterrent. 
The portability has definitely gotten the edge for me. I can fit my 3ds in my pocket and take it everywhere. I can't even imagine taking the 2ds anywhere.
For a first go, it didn't turn out bad. I thought it was tasty. 

It definitely took a lot of time from start to plating, about 13 hours total (if I don't count the 24 hour marinade). I froze a ton of my leftover soup base. So I may have another go at it soon :)
More or less, but it doesn't teach you how to make the Tare, which was the essential piece to add depth to the flavor.

I also used my own recipe to make the char sui :)
Pig Trotters and Chicken Bone heated for 8 hours on low to medium heat. Threw in carmelized onions, garlic, ginger while it was cooking. Strained it.

When I prepped my ramen broth, I threw in my stock along with my shoyu-tare that I prepped and topped it with mayu that I made.
During the week the only time I have to play games are during my 1 hour train commute and during lunch. 

I love that I can have all my games, lengthy or short, in my pocket and be able to play them whenever I want. Extremely helpful when I'm out and doing errands and need to kill some time.

I had this problem too. As the code suggests and what I understand you are having a get prop error which is the safety to ensure that you are flashing the correct phone with the correct ROM. You will need to go and find the file with the getprop code and remove it manually. Make sure you are flashing the correct rom. After I removed it on my S3 I was able to flash to current ROM. Also make sure you have the current version of TWERP/CWO and GAPPS. Hope this helps.

Well in their defense, during rush hour traffic the trains get over packed to the point that you are smushed against people in all sorts of conditions.

I'm sure women in general wouldn't want to be in a situation where they're smushed with opposite sex in a tin can.
How close do you have to be at let's say a starbucks or a mcdonalds? I pass by them plenty of times on my commute (walk) to work in a major city.

That's probably AC transit. I took the same thing during the last strike. I heard that AC transit may go on strike as well? Can anyone confirm this?
You need a credit card enabled debit card to make purchases in the E-Shop.

US resident here. You are absolutely right regarding only needing to put in the exact amount for game purchases. Never have to worry about stray balances :)
I commute to a major city. I usually get 1-2 street passes per day. I bought the new games and I'm surprised that every person I've street passed since then has had bough the new street pass games. YMMV since you do live in a not so streetpassy area, but I thought I'd share that people are buying it.
Where's the trans bay terminal?
It's like looking in the  mirror. You sir are me.... :( I feel you. I will look for advice in this thread. Best of luck.
Thanks this was one of my biggest fears. 
What are the cons for moving the 401k over to my new company?

Thanks, I'll look into Vanguard to see what sort of options they have. It's good to have choices.
By calling Fidelity and rolling it into their IRA will the amount invested be added to my annual earnings that I will have to pay taxes for during tax season?
Thanks I've been thinking of getting this for the past six months and I finally made the jump.
Went with the Soundtrack. Seems like the only thing that I would use at Platinum minus the calendar.
Smells like 4chan's doing...
I keep getting a status 7 when I flash... :(
This! This is the mentality that you should have. 2 years ago I was in the same boat. Sure I didn't have a job, but applying for jobs was my job. Sure I did not have a job for six months.... but when you apply for 10-20 jobs a day and explore your contacts there isn't much to be ashamed of 'cause you're being more productive than your peers.
I had a professor that would teach this way. Basically if you did well on the final, you passed. It's about mastery of the material rather than a history of progress that determines your grade.
One step closer to unlocking the eternal sharingan.
"What do you mean it doesn't fit?!"

"There's a sprinkler pipe installed there already."

That's why they say electrical is the nervous system of the building :) You are dead without us lol
The pipes are so tiny and my conduit zone is so huge!
I called around game stop and they only carry pre-orders. Some stores say they may get it "late". It's just a constant hunt for a while. I'm in the same boat, my GF didn't want the pre-order and changed her mind after she saw me playing the game. -_______________-
At least it wasn't Kidz Bop - Ni**as in Paris.
Galaxy S3 user here, so far the app seems to be use able for me. I don't always have the computer with me, so I'm glad to have a mobile app to water my plants on my long commutes. 

I do wish that on the mobile app that there was an option to type in Japanese and not make everything a multiple choice test. I know we can spell the kana out with blocks but it's just not the same. 
I only need one:

Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Memrise is on google play now!
There is always a comment saying there is always a relevant XKCD!
It does pretty much everything and is free and light weight. I use it on all my phones. This pretty much made my Galaxy S1 a rejuvenated phone.
I really like your Edward :)
Decided to look myself up...I missed my cake day by 7 days!!!!!!

EDIT: Holy shit! Thanks for the Gold man. This is how I'm feeling right now.

3 years ago the iPhone wasn't even available in Japan. That was when iOS was the leader of the market and Android was still split between tablet and phone OS. People were constantly asking me to ship them an iPhone that they can use/sell on the market for $$$.

No surprise that it's still the leader over there compared to what I saw 3 years ago.
I got mine also! Single Red. Backed 4/18 Arrival today :)
Aloe Vera has helped me also with itchiness...
+Design Engineer

+Yes, I do both

+Yes, started off in AutoCAD. Electrical systems, fire alarm, lighting.

+Revit for 3D production.

+Hand drafting is the thing of the past, it takes too much time, unless you are trying to do quick 
sketches/explanations. Computer Automated Drafting is the standard now it seems.


Edit: Formatting.
None for the S3?
Yeah, I still use both my books for continual review every once in a while. Glad that you liked what you saw! Also check out the workbooks online too.
When I was prepping for my internship in Japan. I had 6 months to study and my teacher used Nakama 1 and Nakama 2 to facilitate learning.

I think the book is fairly old so you can get it for cheap. I'll come back with more info tomorrow if you'd like.
Alcohol. My Father gave me a taste of his beer as a kid and I gave the biggest stank face.

Now adult me is looking back at child me and just shake my head in disappointment.
That is awesome, do you mind posting the whole list and not the sample? 
Not enough time travel in the nude...
I was about to download and decided to check what the changelog had to say. Needless to say, glad it was the top post.
I'm from SF and I haven't seen anyone wearing glass! =(
When I read the post, I was thinking..."This has to be in SF!"
This is awesome! I made a copy into my Google Docs. Thanks for putting this together!

What are the challenges to improving music to an act that is also being improved?
Looks great. I'll check it out!
I was wondering the same thing!
THIS IS SPARTA!!!!!!!!!!
When I did the night climb, it was during Obon and was it **CROWDED**. There was a line all the way to the top of the mountain! 
You may want to buy little oxygen tanks as well. I went to Don Quijote (DONKI) in Shibuya (http://www.donki.com/search/shop_detail_en.php?st_store_id=21) to buy them and they helped my altitude sickness. We climbed the mountain kind of fast, so I wasn't adjusting to the elevation changes that well. I did the night climb, but I'm sure you will be fine doing it in the day.

There are food stations if you do not bring any, but it's pretty pricey.

I cannot stress warm clothes and layers. You don't know how windy it may get on the mountain and you don't want to be stuck in a bind without warm clothes.

Side note: Also surprisingly, I had cell service all the way to the top. So if you do get in a bind, you can make calls.
I remember having to say "I'm sorry for leaving before you" every time I left work in Japan.
Good Call, I haven't updated a nightly in over a month. Glad I chose to do it on the 26th or I would have been screwed.
:( We just wanted to be friends!
I used the conditioner once or twice in a 3 week span and I feel like my hair is starting over with the detoxing. YMMV though....
Which subreddit are we using? It's confusing having two.
We just gave this guy a huge phone bill.
At first I couldn't tell if you were joking or not lol
I agree it is a personal preference. I originally was against digitally downloading games when I first heard the shift to digital games (game files can get big [at least for big console systems]), but have quickly changed my opinion once I bought my 3DS.

I'm really paying for the convenience of it all. 90% of the time, I just have it background download while I'm doing other things (work around the house, watching tv, or sleeping). No need to travel to the store. No need to carry around all my games. No worry about losing my games.

If there are any problems, I can always call Nintendo to clear things up.
Thanks for posting this, I was close to overdrafting -_-;;
Easy as transferring regular data.

TIL Tom Hanks grew up in Oakland.
Yeah, I'm surprised OP got the shot that he got. I could never get to close to the window every time I visited.
I wonder how many SWC's he's doing.
Proof will be him/her swimming in their monies Scrooge McDuck Style.
I think part of the reason why natural gas is getting such a big push is that the cost per volume is fairly cheap right now. Sorry I forgot the number. 

One thing to note is that if we harvest natural gas  from places like landfills the gas has to be filtered which can get costly because of the unknown variable of what material is thrown in there. 
You've officially made me realize I need to repickup my power systems book. -_____-
That's a pretty clean keyboard. What are you using?
