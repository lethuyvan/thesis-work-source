Yup just got the update, its bigger because we got an update to the bootloader it seems? the "powered by android font" on the bootscreen updated with a new one.

Started shooting film a few months ago, check out my feeds! 

ps: will follow back anyone from reddit :)
Do you have the link? Its version 8.4.43.632 isn't it? If yes i got the same one and it still doesn't work, tried login/creating new account.
The alphagamers version didn't worked out anymore, it logged out the account and can't make a new account via the app.

Edit: JohnEdwardMS from libre.io version still works.
I thought its not S7 related issue? my instagram also freeze and lag sometimes but the same thing also happened to my friends using Xiaomi phone.
Wait until the Oreo update comes.
Looks like we got all the goodies from the S8, love that new statusbar battery icon!
Yup its really buggy in the recent updates, don't know what happened. It also happens on my friends xiaomi phone too.
A little bit of sharpie? I honestly like the brassing look on old camera, it makes the camera looks well used. [check out this Pentax KX](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYw_rn_h3PZ/)
I know right? The owner of the lab say their dev and scan tools is working fine, at first i didn't believe what he say because probably something weird when they developed or scan the roll. But after the same film from different camera result is send to me i kinda trust him and that makes me really confused.
Hello I have a question about KCP 200, i just recently developed 2 of KCP 200 on the local lab but the picture turned out really yellow. But the picture from my [Nikon Zoom 310 AF](https://imgur.com/a/jTpns) using the same film turned out fine, and from the [Pentax Spotmatic](https://imgur.com/a/ypdxh) with Super takumar 50mm f/1.8 turned really yellow. 

My local lab says it maybe this KCP 200 batch the make this roll turned really yellow. But all the film I use is purchased on the same local store, even the picture I take from my K1000 is also yellow (I purchased another KCP 200 from ebay) when developing on the same lab.

So what's the actual problem here?
The question is.. how pekka and mini pekka would look when they didn't wear the helmet?
My favorite memories is of cource when i win the gold flair from card design contest!
Gameplay and menu screenshot?
Yup its only from earth, btw its called vibranium.
It seems Olympus µ[mju:] series or Olympus XA meet your requirement.
[This](https://www.fixez.com/store/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s7/samsung-galaxy-s7-battery-replacement?utm_source=JerryRigEverything&utm_medium=GalaxyS7Battery&utm_campaign=JerryRigEverything) one is linked on jerryrigheverything video seems recommended.
cool!
I think one click to open to the song on Spotify/YouTube/Google Play Music will be awesome.
My friend just bought Pentax Spotmatic with 55mm f/1.8 at local store for $85 here's the [camera](https://imgur.com/j3ETwOO), they also have a few [Spotmatic body](https://imgur.com/RvEqJP2) with a good condition for only $25, trying to get a friend to got into the same hobby as you is pretty exciting!

Do you guys have a recommendation for the most affordable flash for Pentax K1000 that compatible with pc sync? and also if the hotshoe no longer working does it'll still works if i plug it to the camera?

Thanks!
I'm pretty much new to analog camera things, what do you mean by "given up"? I thought mechanical slr will last forever (with some proper cla) since they're built like a tank outside and inside.
I really like how cinestill react to the neon lamps.

Bootloader unlock its like opening the gate of the customization like custom rom and etc.
If you care more about the battery buy the S7 edge. I personally have S7 Snapdragon and the battery life isn't that good, my usage averaging to 3h SoT. I also use Z3 Compact before and the battery on that thing really superior.
If you plan to use custom rom get the Exynos S7, the bootloader on Snapdragon S7 is locked and there's no custom rom at all.
Looking fresh!, what year is it?
Its from [uniqlo](http://clickmemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/uniqlo-daftpunk.jpg), i have the same one too but the black one.
I was surprised when i heard it!
Thank you very much! I really appreciate it.
Want to start shooting at night outdoor on a small concert with my K1000 with broken LM using zoom lens by Braun 28-70mm f/3.4-4.8 (I use LM app on my phone), only have KCP200. Can you guys give me advice how to shoot outdoor with less light? like what is the best aperture and the shutter speed to use, I didn't really find any photography site that explaining this kind of thing that easily understandable for someone who just recently got into analog camera.
Damn, this looks like a painting.
Hey! just got my first analog slr too its Pentax K1000, can't wait to see the pictures that comes from it. What film did you use? I personally use Agfa Vista 200. Btw I think you should share some of your photo on /r/analog.
Woah, thanks! Do you know why the one in my pic didn't have any type branding on it?
I think they already made it, its called [Waze](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waze&hl=en).

Did you miss typed switching from Sync to Relay?, Reddit Sync have that feature for a long time.
I know android already have back button but slide from left to right gesture to go back is pretty convenience.
I still have the link of it, just pm me if anyone needed it.
Took [this](http://imgur.com/ZkDi2cu) a few weeks ago with my S7 (and edited with vsco) photo when i and all my 16 college friend doing what it called [Student study service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_study_service_\(Indonesia\)) in a village for 1 month and its really far from my home. I'm having a great time in there and making such a unforgettable memories.
Yeaaaahhh, keep em coming!

QHD is the best and highest one, you should read more on [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_resolution).
Very nice bike and photo, I can see every inch of this beauty.
That's why I also like and dislike about my Z3C before switching to S7, everything else is just work and snappy especially if you running concept firmware but the hardware started to falling appart (headphone jack not working, screen can't response touch and the battery bulging out the back cover).
They moved to Xperia X, which is just [ended](http://www.xperiablog.net/2017/04/19/xperia-x-concept-to-end-in-may-xperia-xz-premium-to-take-over/) a few months ago. Sadly there's still no news for the next concept device.
Not sure it'll be come to S7 probably in the future. The new icon sure looks pretty nice, the [battery icon](http://imgur.com/a/EsGap) also looks different too.
I think this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6lu3va/the_marvel_cinematic_universe_timeline_with_new/) explaining this thing better.
That's really impressive my S7 Snapdragon only can reach 5sot with 17h standby time, btw what theme did you use on your phone?
Yup its the same [thing](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7394513?hl=en&ref_topic=7391797&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=0), allo is "supposedly" runs differently from Hangouts but honestly i also don't understand it very much since they're pretty similar chat app by Google except Allo has more gimmicky feature.
Hey its moronic monday you can ask basically anything related to android either its stupid or not hahaha, Afaik [Google Assistant](https://support.google.com/allo/answer/7276628?hl=en) is currently only available in English, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish.
Some people just don't give a fuck about the upside down screen and jelly scrolling, Imo OP5 is a really good phone for the price if you want the latest and greatest spec.
For some reason they see reddit as a porn site.
Its blocked on some provider, I use [dnscrypt](https://dnscrypt.org/) on pc (much better than vpn) and on my phone i always use vpn.
Yeah and if you realize almost all of his videos is always ends with an exclamation mark.
Galaxy Note 7 is literally the next big thing that totally flopped.
You can install the update without workarounds since version 6.1.02.
Hands down this is the best midrange phone for 2017, Easily my best phone recommendation for this range of price.

You can also do that with ice spirit by placing the ice spirit after the first fire spirit died by your tower.
I heard somewhere on XDA Snapdragon S8/S8+ have locked bootloader just like on the Snapdragon S7/S7 Edge, that's why until now there's no active development on Snapdragon S7/S7 Edge compared to the Exynos version.

>How could the s8 be inferior to the s7? do you really just mean that the features it provides are not worth the price increase? 

IMO the only difference is the new infinity display, the rest of it is basically the same or only slightly improved. Its like S6 to S7 upgrade, the S7 is refinement of S6. Better wait for S9 if you didn't mind waiting but if you always want the latest and greatest S8 is definitely one of the best smartphone right now.
Dayum, your photo looks like it came straight from stock windows wallpaper.
After a few cable test, turns out my cable isn't that good it always stay around 500mAh, after i tried another cable with normal charging it can stay at 1000mAh+.
It should, but in a really loong run. Samsung already prevented it with moving the aod every minutes.
Reddit Lambda have a space for you.
I think Mobile Legends isn't optimized well enough for Tegra processor, buy any other device that didn't use Tegra processor like Snapdragon or Exynos. I'm using Galaxy S7 and its run really smooth, even my old phone Xperia Z3 Compact runs Mobile legends with no lags at all.
His review of HTC U Ultra.
You can download the hi-res on their wallpaper archive link on the article.
AFAIK its depends on your model number, if yours is G930U then you will get the unlocked G930U model OTA.
It makes me curious why the US unlocked model seems always late getting all the updates, is it because they want the update to be optimized just like the Exynos model or they forgotten the Snapdragon model and more likely focusing on the Exynos?.
Woah, I think this is the first time i see bad review of the Pixel on /r/Android. What makes you unhappy with the Pixel? I really like Pixel but its really hard to find one in my country and got the S7 instead.
Indonesia - Almost everyone who have smartphone never use SMS anymore, we mostly use Line Messenger and WhatsApp.
Need stem upgrade, does anyone have recommendation the cheaper version of Thomson X2 10°?

edit: Any thought with this [one](http://imgur.com/a/0JoZK)?
Not op, but does the lag really noticeable on the S7 compared to 3T?
Just focus requesting the card you want to upgrade. 
Says /u/ClashRoyale obviously.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/5t8b8i/developer_qa_round_vi_answers/
You have minions and princess..
Imo /u/yyarn is Trainer Tips of Clash Royale.
Play it casually, try different deck, try to max out your main deck, try to push to 5K, play challenges. There are many things you can do after you reach 4K, just starts enjoy the game and not worrying about trophy.
Its probably just a kid or someone's dad who playing casually.
Do you mean OP card lvl? I'm also f2p and have similar lvled card on my main deck, just request constantly a card you want to upgrade and play challenges with your free gems.
Its actually pretty easy with donating a lot, my clanmate is lvl 12 f2p with 70k donations.
Yup its typically easier and cheaper way to get 700c track frames.
Its safe, most of customized frame here is done by local frame builder.
Correct, long story short, it seems the previous owner changed the road dropout to track dropout. This very common here in indonesia changing old road bike with semi horizontal dropout to track dropout.
Android has solved this thing with banner message a long ago, idk why iOS not changed this notification already.
I need help installing threadless [headset](http://imgur.com/a/nz0RF), is the top case suppossedly fit to the upper bearing case? (it seems the top case able to fit in but i'm unable to install it in place and also the top case looks slightly bend)
Yup the season 3 just released a few weeks ago, watch it [here](http://kissanime.ru/Anime/Yowamushi-Pedal-New-Generation).
Woah, did you already have maxed out battle ram?
For the price Z Play is slightly cheaper, I don't know how long Moto/Lenovo will support this phone but looking at 3T with their developer friendly support 3T seems more future proof since there's a ton developer working on this phone on XDA.
Also check out Pixel/Pixel XL, its basically iPhone in android world.
Speedy software and good battery life? OnePlus 3T or Moto Z play would be a good choice.
If you liked TouchWiz, S7 is superior compared to OP3T better camera quality, sdcard, water resist, QHD screen. If you prefered stock android looks OP3T is a good choice its basically a poorman Pixel.

It depends on what deck you will use, and fyi the card that you will get from mc/smc isn't depend on what arena chest you bought. So the chance is random that you will get a bunch of clone and bowler.
Its friendly battle replay over friendlist.
What do you mean by off pitch?, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzQnYpPzuA8) and [this (with video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJlB96SYmk8) sounds pretty decent.

Ah i just realized no one has shared the .ftf (firmware file) yet, you can't use the app, you need to install it manually via flashtool if someone already shared the .ftf file.
The difference only dual sim and network bands right? you should be able to install this on your f5122 but you'll lose dual sim capability, I'm using Z3 compact d5833 with android concept from d5803 firmware and it works just fine.
Nope, it snap after many tries. I thought the headset have problem at first but after that bam! it snapped lol.
I'm okay, just a few bruise and wound on knee and face.
Its the same thing like i said before. It comes like pre zapping lava hound right before it dying it will only stun the lava pup, same thing like sending ice spirit right before lava hound explode the lava pup will still get froze without getting any damage.
Do you have any experience of this bug with skarmy? can you reproduce this bug but with skarmy? the frost nova doesn't affect m.horde in that case because ice golem get shot from the tower and also the opponent spawned m.horde right after the ice golem explode not before.
I think this is suppossed to be in this game. The same thing applied to pre zap to lava hound, it only stun the lava pup.
Hey i think i followed you on G+, nice bike!
[More info](https://www.instagram.com/sakra_components/), its around $90-$100.
Not op, but i'm using yarn chip deck on 4K+ before it kinda weak in this meta. Too many counter for the mini pekka (since almost everyone run ebarbs its really common to see skarmy and tombstone, this deck also weak to ebarbs btw).
Yeah that's why i included OP3T and S7, my point here is should i take android that i interested or just take the iPhone.
YOU SHILL, you doesn't even know duARTe loves macbook?!
https://www.reddit.com/r/androidcirclejerk/wiki/approveddevices
Macbook is approved device
I would if i could lol, everyone in here is finding the thief together. Even i found the seller who sell this bike online on instagram comment of this stolen bike report.

Idk exactly but the frame itself cost around $900+ and the front wheel cost $1300+, Check his [Pedalroom](http://www.pedalroom.com/bike/dosnoventa-detroit-2-pursuit-20962) if you want to know more detail about this bike. 
I'm on my 6th and lose at 8 wins and got a sparky instead, Congrats btw!
Hey! another indonesian on r/FixedGearBicycle, Nice bike btw!
Yup, it's an Indonesian thing buses over here have this crazy-ass horns, and kids would say this whenever a bus passes by. https://twitter.com/dannisatria/status/811236151528783872?s=09
Is that running man? what episode is it?
If he have zap/log in hand, that would be lose in 10 seconds.
Its random just like SMC but still on the cycle, https://twitter.com/OJeveryday/status/796395683855011840.
Yup its normal, only the first ever cycle will got you legendary chest before/after epic chest.
Yeah, if the leak are true IT would be the new card that join the overnerfed club just like poison.
Its been posted before https://www.reddit.com/r/clashroyale/comments/5dym81/_/
Goddamnit op you should put sp00k warning on the title, I almost died because of it.

Do you have any replay with this deck?, always interested by xbow deck but it never work that well for me.

edit: found it myself https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/58w8c3/xbow_beatdown_deck_guide_4000_trophies_w/
Replace inferno tower with tombstone, fireball with lightning.
I ride with 46-15.
Its kinda weak without miner, but try it out LH, Mega minion, Minion, Minion Horde, Lightning, Tombstone, Zap/Arrow, The last card can be swapped with Archer, Knight, Baby Dragon.
And it also duo and wear helmet, definitely reference to daftpunk.
Nice, i use and really like yarn chip deck before and will definitely try this deck.
http://www.supercellfan.it/2016/clash-royale/leak-nuove-carte-mago-elettrico-mega-barbari-clonazione-e-tornado/
Or MP/Valk for Miner and lure MM with Goblin, don't drop anything before they drop the Lightning. I'm using Miner+MP cycle, the winning condition is 50/50 when i faced LH+Lightning.
Since Hog cycle pretty weak to air you need to practice more. If they just lightning your IT prepare goblin for the miner, then use Ice wizard+Zap to finish the Lava pups, and lure the MM using Fire spirit (very tricky). If you still struggling with the Lavapup+Miner you can also try to replace Zap to Arrow.
Replace your MP or Valk with Inferno tower, and also replace your Tombstone with Zap for the lava pup.
Slum "throwing pizza guy" Worm.
Rest in peace just like the [Note 7](http://i.imgur.com/g6t4kWC.gif).
This is ~~gold~~ positive elixir trade, and btw i just realized OJ Clan icon is probably added by Supercell because of Orange Juice channel.
Your post make me excited because tomorrow i'll be able to upgrade my M.Pekka to lvl 9. Btw if you struggling against the meta right now try yarn miner chip deck Inferno Tower, M.Pekka, Zap, Goblins, Ice Spirit, Miner, Princess, The log (Can be replaced by Firespirit).
Love that mega barbs description!
How did you deal with huge elixir push? is it just freeze and minion/goblin/m.pekka?
Wow i just realized that, does it also mean lvl 2 log can kill lvl 4 princess now?
Imo upgrading legendary card to lvl 2 is not that worth it, legendary cards that probably depends with lvl is lavahound (so the lavapup can survive zap) and the log (killing high lvl princess).
http://clashroyalearena.com/guides/card-drop-rates
They selling it for just $1 on indonesian grocery store called alfamart, I found [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Star-Wars-ROGUE-ONE-Collectible-Medallion-Coin-/172372133268?hash=item28222e0594:g:S9sAAOSw4shX~b4M#viTabs_0) from quick ebay finding if you really want it.

What i like about iOS, "Software update directly from Apple for almost 5 years".
/u/yyarn approved 👍.
Maybe 3-4 in a row, and after that losing streak is coming. Afaik this will happen when you get tilted or supercell rigged your matchmaking.
Can't wait until /u/clashroyale make commercial about golem with sunglasses.
That's good, actually magical chest have a pretty low chance to get a legendary in it.
This deck is awesome!, I'm using the exact same deck except i replace lumberjack with mini pekka, hovering around 3.8-3.9k right now.
Its a fake lvl 8 tho (with that card lvl), but its still possible if you have enough skill, see ChiefPat with his f2p account that already reached legendary arena lvl 8 and 9/6/0/2 card.
You're just tilting, close the game and do something else for a while and play again if you feel better (Today I tilted from 3900 to 3600 and after that I climb back to 3800).
Its a MissingNO legendary card!
Who knows? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  They have done 2 sneak peeks on the 2nd day of sneak peeks on the last update and 1 sneak peeks on the 1st and 3rd day.
I'm hoping there's a friendlist tab in there [http://imgur.com/a/ZlNkK](http://imgur.com/a/ZlNkK)
Tomorrow obviously
LG G5, doesn anyone in here even own this phone? I haven't seen any LG G5 flair.
Yup, golem knockback with 2 elixir!
[I see it now](http://imgur.com/a/Wizxv), your previous post make it looks confusing.
I would absolutely remove credit card ^^^get ^^^it?.
Yes
That's an achievement for trolling in lower arena.
This is so fun to read, I thought you blew up the clan by become co leader and kick everyone else.
She's the first and my favorite legendary card i've got, its sad to see her kinda broken now idk why supercell nerfing her when no one say any op thing about princess (I know its probably overused bs).
Yeah, my comment kinda misleading. We probably only get some bug fix or some security update(?).
RIP Z3/Z3c 
[They also unsurprisingly ended the concept firmware support :(](https://plus.google.com/+ZingoAndersen/posts/JfUNdx5iQhF)
Yup, it definetely better with the giant/rg meta right now.
I don't think there's a guide for this deck (and i can't make a guide for it), basically you just counter attack with everycard+miner. You can also do deadly push with Miner+M.Pekka+Ice spirit or Miner+Goblin+/Ice spirit.
I use yyarn deck with 2.8 avg and so far it works well, 

**Triple legendary warning**

M.Pekka, Ice Spirit, Stab gobs, Inferno, Zap, Miner, Princess, The log.


Edit: If anyone want to see this deck in action watch this video https://youtu.be/28Qefb46_xw?t=112 or his last [twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/orangejuice/v/85168227) 

Looks like he got a cramp at the start, poor guy.
Yeah that's kinda true, but everyone will rarely place him at the bridge anymore.
RG is basically a walking mortar/xbow, imo increasing the deploy time to 4/5 seconds probably will work.
This post and all the comments in here makes me want to wait the new nexus before I upgraded to the 5X, should I wait until the new nexus available in my country or just snag the 5X? I don't think the new nexus will available in my country fast and relatively cheap tho :(.
Actually many people including me didn't know how to counter bowler properly without air troops, what is the most intimidating threat to your bowler?
Don't sent out troops if you don't have anything to support it, you just can counter and wait the until its the right time to do a push (If the opponent just placed giant on the kingtower you should do the same thing). Try to counter with Mini pekka+minions on your lavahound deck and Mini pekka+Musketeer on your giant deck or just push and throw everything on the other lane.
Replace barbs with mini pekka and valk with inferno/cannon or mayber furnace, you got a decent miner deck.
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ftfy
[He use that car door to make a human taco.](https://youtu.be/Ymw5uvViqPU?t=45)
The third image makes the building looks dancing when you scroll.
Actually i really like inferno as it is, if the opponent zap your inferno he probably can't stop the counter attack with miner+gobs/miner+m.pekka+firespirit.
How did you stick the phone holder to the handlebar? I have the same phone holder and want to try it to my bicycle.
You definetly still need arrows for minion horde right? I would suggest replacing either archer/minion with zap.
If you didn't really like payfecta you should be fine with fire spirit, your deck is pretty much my old deck except i replace minion horde for minion. You can be super aggresive with any card paired with miner.
I get my first ever smc on my 1700 wins...
I probably will choose arceus, and let him make something.
Its ok, you definitely will go back to legendary after you learned it pretty well.
Always try to destroy the elixir pump+give pressure after they placed it, you will good to go.
Sweet disposition
Afaik phonecats 5 is not official phonecats feeder.
My main account on my android phone, second account on iPad.
Probably because the tourney the ladder become pretty slow, i'm at 3.1-3.3k and facing a lot lvl 10 with 3.6-3.8k pb.
Its Princess, miner, mini pekka, zap, firespirit, minion, cannon, goblin.
Well, the home button also screams samsung more than samsung itself.
How did you deal with knight/mini pekka/musketeer/valk? just throw mini pekka? and what are your win condition combo? miner+mini pekka/hog? 

edit: I just tried this deck on tourney and its pretty legit
You need to practice more, I get miner around a month ago and i'm trying princess+miner deck until i dropped to 2.8k from 3k soon as i learn it pretty well my trophy goes up and break my pb to 3.3k.
Thanks!, rip my flair?
Am i missing something?
I made [every card pic!](http://imgur.com/a/80OP3)
Its seems like op just maxing out his charizard without knowing the IV are pretty bad.
How did you make the overlay and dimming works? it doesn't work on my Z3C running 6.0.1 not rooted.
Idk what happen but i can confirm, i see it on twitch stream the witch get retarget by minion when the streamer trying to tank and spank with cannon+minion.
Sometime shop showing the same type of card since may 1st update.
What is your deck? you definetly need beefier unit to deal with splash troop.
Valkyrie for bomber and wizard, Defensive building+small troops for the giant.
So what is it? afaik this is legit phone concept leak from [sony huge leak on 2015](http://www.xperiablog.net/2015/04/18/is-sony-working-on-an-all-metal-xperia-flagship-multiple-official-concept-images-leak/).
It looked like the leaked sony concept phone [tube](http://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/181693-image/Leaked-internal-Sony-renders-of-the-Xperia-Z4-and-new-UI.jpg) and [seamless](http://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Leaked-internal-Sony-renders-of-the-Xperia-Z4-and-new-UI.jpg)
Damn, he can easily reach 3.5K+ with that troop lvl.
This reminds me of hayao mizaki movie
I respond by beating him (if that possible) and bming back.
You can't unlink your gplay acc, the only way to do that is give the google account and btw [you can't sell/trading your account](https://supercell.helpshift.com/a/clash-of-clans/?s=my-account&f=can-i-buy-sell-or-share-accounts&p=web).
It runs very well on my Z3C
You should not regret anything, i would definitely choose Op3 instead of Zf3 with that software.
I use this deck since i got the miner

Princess, Miner, Minion Horde, Hogrider, Firespirit, Stabgobs, Zap, Cannon

Or try this one Princess, Miner, Minion, Minipekka, Firespirit, Elixir Pump, Zap, Cannon

I use this deck since i got the miner

You can't give a knight shovel and call him a spell right? so does miner.
Damn that's a lot of card, congrats btw.

I wonder what #1 ranked get.
Rg decks with no legendary pretty good its RG, minion, barbs, spear gobs, skeleton, arrow, cannon, fireball

Trifecta decks also works well i think.
Its stab gobs, fire spirit, zap, inferno, mini pekka, miner, princess and ice wiz.
So the tips leak on another thread is true, lumberjack and trunk. My guess, trunk will be something like log that rolling and give splash damage and knockback like the bowler rock.

Set your reminder, the new legendary sneak peak will be announced in around 8 hour from now.
It support quickcharge if you use official magnetic dock.
Mini pekka is pretty good for counter pushing, barbs and minions will probably get fireballed/arrowed.
Someone already posted this [2 hour ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/4qq6dz/update_sneak_peak/) 
Imo all small troops like goblin, spear gobs, minion are all around balanced.
I don't think you need fireball if you have fire spirit, maybe replace it with mini pekka/hog?
That's called sleep paralysis man, not lucid dreaming.
I see somewhere on google+ and xda, mobile radio and camera didn't work, and a new build that fix this coming soon.

1. Yes, 1

2. F2P

3. Free Chest

4. 9

5. Princess
They still working on it 
https://plus.google.com/+vickysofyanr/posts/dnQu7KVP86q
I wish GNL have icon pack support
Rest a little bit and go for trophy pushing again, you still have time to reach legendary. That's what i'm doing when i push to legendary for the first time.
Its fake i think, actually i don't understand why hog need a nerf, he's easily can be countered with anything cannon, skeleton, barbs. Imo the only card that need to be nerfed right now is royal giant.
Just wait until ice wiz or miner available in the shop, lvl 2 legendary isn't worth unless you're p2w or get another one from chest.
Pretty much yes, that's why i don't use any epics on my deck. I'm lvl 9 on legendary arena and all my epics are lvl 1/2 (some can be upgraded to lvl 3).
Lesson learned, never grind the crown chest before you sleep.
Princess can work in almost every deck, I personally always have princess and minion horde in my deck.
https://twitter.com/ClashRoyale/status/737538207114362884
I've played since android soft launch and hit legendary 2 weeks ago as lvl 8, someone already hit [legendary on lvl 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi4rFWLrq7I).
Yup, i think the matchmaking need a tweak a little bit, its like a hellhole for lvl 7-8 in there. My mini account also matched with soo many lvl 7-8 while I'm lvl 5 (Its now early lvl 6) :(.
You should try to make a new account and go to arena 4 and 5, its like a hellhole for lvl 7-8 in there. My mini account matched with soo many lvl 7-8 while I'm lvl 5 (Its now early lvl 6) :(.
Fireball (for Minion Horde and Barbarian), Arrow (Minion Horde/Princess), Barbarian/Mini Pekka (Hog and Royal Giant), and Cannon/Inferno (Hog and Royal Giant) should be on your deck.
What time did you start the tournament? I live in gmt+7 country and interested joining the tourney.
Actually we need confirmation button on everywhere on this game. (buying something, start a battle)
I highly recommend concept
Or if that's not possible to add maybe add last active status
Each level will individually increased by that 10%
I also have my own deck that bring me to legendary, I use it from around 1800 trophy

Barbarian Hut, Goblin Hut, Hog Rider, Barbarian, Minion Horde, Knight, Zap, and Princess
There's two things that you can do, close the game and do something else and comeback later or just battle and battle until you get better and reach your highest trophy again. I tilted and dropped to 2800 trophy from 3000 a few hours ago and now i'm already at 3000 again.
Congrats!, I reach it a week ago as lvl 8 and that feels really good!.
Yes, its probably because shitty $upercell server. My internet connection and my ping is really good but its still lagged like hell.
But its pretty easy to go back to legendary after you shifting to royal arena, i don't know why but it feels easier (atleast for me).
Friendlist for sure, you can add friend with their unique code, and if you want to start a friendly battle we will get notified anywhere on the menu screen (you can also deny and accept it).
Princess +1, fit in almost any deck and good for arrow baiting minion horde
Maybe [jason deck](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CgZ8Q3bWcAAUuZQ.jpg)?
That's make the game less fun, because one of the goal of this game is to level up your cards until you reach tournament league (especially for f2p).
Did you push thropy continously or only if the chest slot empty/crown chest available? I want to push thropy to legend but i'm afraid of losing streak. Btw i'm on 2817 right now.
Actually he want another legendary other than sparky, princess, and ice wiz.
Z1 never got any 6.0 firmware
Yes it works, been running concept firmware for a while on my D5833.
The only solution to avoid losing streak is stop playing the game after you lose one or two games, it worked for me.
If you want stock AOSP look go for Concept firmware, its basically nexus with Xperia camera, the battery life is also a little bit better (at least for me).
That's because OP2 sd810 is downclocked, and it makes the performance a little bit slow compared to any other sd810 phone.
Poor little goblin he's trying to escape from barbarians.
Delete your account first on account setting (on setting app) it worked for me
I'd love to join IGN: archer #88PLUG, Level 8, 502 wins, 1329 total donations, Can i join right now? i see reddit gamma have 2 space.
This also happened to me, I believe this game can cause psychological issue if you play it over and over, to deal with it just stop after you lose one or two battle.
Do you have any video or playthrough how to use this deck?
Wait until around september to see if they actually ended the Z series, the smartphone they anounce last month isn't actually mid ranger the X and X Performance have a powerfull soc.
Can you also make it [material design](http://developer.android.com/design/material/index.html)?
Marshmallow concept only available on regular Z3 and Z3 Compact.
Yup, not only chrome you can also do this gesture on almost every app that have two finger zoom.
Probably yes, new emoji added on Android 6.0.1
Does your z3c still running this firmware? can you extract the new camera app using [apk extractor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ext.ui&hl=en) for me?

 Thanks!
You can get 16gb nexus 5x with $300
http://blogs.sonymobile.com/2015/10/06/sony-xperia-and-android-6-0-marshmallow/
Keep in mind "Sony Android Concept" and "Xperia Beta Program" are two different thing. On "[Sony Android Concept](http://blogs.sonymobile.com/2015/10/07/sonys-concept-for-android-marshmallow-edition/)" (Z2 is not supported) you get experimental unskinned android firmware from Sony and it will never become official firmware, on "[Xperia Beta Program](http://www.xperiablog.net/2016/02/10/sony-launches-xperia-beta-program-for-official-marshmallow-release/)" you get normal Xperia firmware with Xperia skin like the one that come with your phone but it still in beta testing phase.
Go for it man or the alternative are use bluetooth earphone/headphone if you worried about the audio jack.
But the iPhone can't charge underwater

I use imak case on my Z3c and it looked like casemate barely there, here's one for [Z1c](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Transparent-Screen-Protector-Compact-IA40064/dp/B00O8G9YKY/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1456742203&sr=1-6&keywords=z1+compact+imak) and if you want the colorful one maybe [nilkin](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Screen-Protector-Compact-Nillkin-NK20140/dp/B00JAJYDCI/ref=sr_1_sc_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1456742290&sr=1-3-spell&keywords=z1+compact+nilkin) also works.
Are you on android? I also have this issue on android app version 1.1.2, when the match started it will freeze until I press recent apps for a few times and go back to clash royale.
I thought you want to explain strategy for arena 4 :/, my noob instinct say replace the barbs hut with skeleton army to take down hog/prince.
Use [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blogspot.byterevapps.lollipopscreenrecorder&hl=en) app to record the screen, don't forget to enable "Record audio (MIC)" in the app setting. btw how did you grow and level up so fast? any tips and trick?, the game just recently available on android for about a week.

Come to indonesia, we can get *kopi luwak* in here for $10-$18
Wow you're so lucky, i can't even get epic card from gold chest
So the better ways to upgrade a card is only when you use it and frequently used in your deck?
Need some advice, do you guys think its worthed to buy prince with my 2k gold instead upgrading all the troop i have? (or are there any alternative buying another specific card?)
here's my deck right now http://imgur.com/a/RezG9.

The reason why i want to buy prince is because i only have 2 epics in my deck right now and looking at some replay & playthrough prince seems pretty strong when combined with mini dragon. I forget to add i need the advice asap since it only available for 11 hour before it gone.
Post screen test result from ****#*******#7378423#*******#**** and try some of [this](http://support.sonymobile.com/gb/xperiaz3/faq/The-touchscreen-isnt-working-properly/) solution (especially the safe mode and pc companion repair). If none of all the solution worked its probably hardware issue, [some people](https://www.reddit.com/r/SonyXperia/comments/3endsz/top_of_touch_screen_unresponsive_z3c/) also have this problem on their phone and turn out its hardware issue.
Why did you post this if you don't know what the changes? I'm pretty sure this is not marshmallow and also what do you mean significant version bump? the alphabetical letter? The Japan version is always different than in anywhere else.

* 32.0.A.6.209 Usa E6603

Its just a trolling account, almost all sony bloatware can be uninstalled and its not actually a bloatware some of them are pretty useful.
The only difference X have is SD650 and not waterproof, everything else is pretty much the same.
Its pretty much a flagship, SD820, 3GB ram, 23MP and 13MP camera, fingerprint sensor, waterproof. 
Its probably the most optimized phone in the history of android to date, great hardware+awesome software.
Their phone are pretty easy to root and it also have pretty good aosp rom support.
Check your software update, the new build is [3536](http://www.xperiablog.net/2016/02/22/new-marshmallow-concept-update-mmb29m-z1-3536-adds-feb-2016-security-patch/).
Mainly because the battery life, light Android skin, Sony open source goodness, and have a good support for software update (keep in mind "good" but not fast).
Imagine when the first time you boot the phone and something pop up and say
"Your phone is full of junk file, do you want to clean it now?"
[Z3 series will definitely get marshmallow](http://blogs.sonymobile.com/2015/10/06/sony-xperia-and-android-6-0-marshmallow/), please stop posting your nonsense argument.
Wut? How did the software hasn't been updated in over a year? 5.1.1 rolled out in july, and 

> why would it magically slow down? 

I don't know what you mean but every software update I have experienced since kitkat it definitely give improvement, especially on marshmallow.
You misunderstood what i mean, the software still running fast compared to any other new flagship not in all around spec. Its pretty dumb if you want to compare the spec to a new 2015-2016 flagship.
I'm pretty sure Z series isn't going anywhere, they only wanted to replace their 6 month cycle with X series, So every year we only see one Z series and one X series.
I'm pretty sure Z series isn't going anywhere, they only wanted to replace their 6 month cycle with X series, So every year we only see one Z series and one X series.
Agreed, I really love every inch of my Z3 Compact. Its still fast and comparable to any other new flagship plus the battery last long.
http://www.xperiablog.net/2016/02/22/xperia-x-family-priced-in-europe-pre-orders-now-live/
You make a wrong decision mate, if you want a fast update and longtime support buy a nexus instead of samsung.
All the X Series use polycarbonate frame the only difference only the back, X and X Performance use metal back (XP with hairline finish), XA plastic.
Yup they changed the battery icon to match stock android, except the wifi icon. Didn't know about the signal icon
For me its necessary, its a pretty cheap way to protect your phone. Its better than regular screen protector and can protect your screen from shattering when you accidentaly dropped the phone.
Lets just hope the [Experimental camera driver](http://developer.sonymobile.com/2015/11/18/experimental-aosp-camera-available-for-experienced-developers/) reaching stable stage so we can have a better camera implementation on AOSP based custom rom. The camera driver even can enable Camera2API on supported device, and atleast for now you still can stick to Sony concept firmware.
*X Performance, the XA is a mid range phone running mediatek processor.
The X Performance definetely [not a budget phone](http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/phones/xperia-x-performance/specifications/).
They said a long ago [QHD screen are not worthed for the battery life](http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-2k-smartphone-screens-are-not-worth-the-battery-compromise).
What do you mean "by stepping out of the resolution race"? X and X Performance using 1080p screen, and the midrange XA use 720p.
[Xperia X Specs](http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/phones/xperia-x/?utm_source=marketing-url&utm_medium=/global-en/products/phones/xperia-x/&utm_campaign=http://www.sonymobile.com/xperia-x#specifications), looks like this one is a super midranger style.

Your battery usage looks normal to me, try to use the device in airplane mode to check if the cellular signal is actually the culprit and if it doesn't, try factory resetting the phone. It solved the most issue i have when my phone battery life & my battery stat getting worse.
You live in a pretty bad cellular signal area.
Sadly the final firmware is just the same as before, they didn't say the concept firmware will be their main fw, but the concept firmware will probably still get updated separately though.
I think this is the first time Samsung bringing new feature and new ui that available on the latest flagship to last year flagship.
[It definetely need reboot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u3ThgkO1SA), how did the phone still turned on if the battery removed? 
They probably removed it now to avoid confusion when the next version of Android comes? rumors say Google will remove app drawer on Android N.
"Slightly" its still looks similar to their old Marshmallow ui, not really close to stock aosp like Sony and Htc new skin.
It sounds like Derezzed?

Edit: didn't see there are vocals in it, but i slightly remembered something from your vocaroo
Atleast its still front facing, they keep changing the speaker design back and forth. This one is much likely the speaker design from Z3 Series, Z5 Series using speaker design from Z2.
That's looks new and interesting, Xperia Z6 maybe?

Edit: Its probably Xperia E5/E6 with Mediatek cpu http://www.xperiablog.net/2016/02/21/new-sony-xperia-codenamed-pp10-leaks-ahead-of-mwc/
Probably there's a rumor that [OnePlus is a sub brand of Oppo](https://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/2411ji/_/), and also I read it somewhere Oppo + OnePlus + Vivo = [BBK Group﻿](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBK_Electronics).
It looks pretty but useless, the app still need to load after the splash screen.
I've heard somewhere they thicken it a bit to minimize the camera hump and to fit a larger battery.

https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/700654167455469568

Nope, if it doesn't work it will charge the device normally as it should and
you can also read some more information about quickcharge in [here](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon/quick-charge/faq).
According to [this](http://www.xperiablog.net/2015/07/02/these-sony-xperia-devices-support-qualcomm-quick-charge-2-0/), only japanese version of Z3 support quickcharge but technically almost anything that use Snapdragon 801 processor support quickcharge 2.0 many user on the comment section on that site also tells it working on Z3, You should give it a try.
Since it doesn't even received "official" lollipop firmware and no development on xda, It doesn't possible to install marshmallow on Z3V.
1. You can change the theme on setting, you can also download a theme on google play by searching "Xperia theme"

2. Go check out /r/androidthemes, and if you want to go to deeper customization go check out [Z5 xda forum](http://forum.xda-developers.com/xperia-z5)

Yes, i can read the nfc banking card with my S5 and my friend A5 with the same app
Sorry slightly off topic, I see on your flair you use Z3. Does your Z3 can scan nfc card (bank card, nfc enabled card, etc) using some kind of apps like [nfc tools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&hl=en)/[nfc taginfo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.mroland.android.apps.nfctaginfo)? My Z3c can't scan the card but the nfc works fine (testing send something to my S5).

Here's three things you can try if its actually software issue.

* Repair with pc companion
* [Reflash the firmware/flash a new lollipop firmware via flashtool](http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/general/list-stock-firmwares-d5803-d5833-t2906706)

When you move the apps to the SD card its taking all the files needed to run that to the SD card. I may not be a 100% correct on this but i'm pretty sure that most System apps need to stay on the internal storage to run correctly and most 3rd party apps (games and such) can be moved the SD card to help free up space on the internal drive.
That's not a problem, that's how moving app to sd card works

All phone with glass back is fragile, you better use case to protect it.
I have a Z3 Compact.

> How rootable is the phone?

Its a little bit complicated, you can root without unlocking the bootloader by flashing older firmware first and then update to the latest by flashing manually stock rooted firmware or you can just root with your current firmware but you need to unlock your bootloader and that will lose the DRM key and [make your camera quality worse+some other feature will not work](http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/10/02/unlocking-the-bootloader-on-sonys-xperia-z3-and-z3-compact-causes-poor-low-light-camera-performance-thanks-to-drm/).

> How much bloatware? What's the UI like compared to stock?

There's some bloatware that can be easily uninstalled, but it also have some stock sony apps that can't be uninstalled. The UI is pretty much stock android with some icons changed and added some new feature. You can also flash official firmware from sony beta testing marshmallow stock http://blogs.sonymobile.com/2015/10/07/sonys-concept-for-android-marshmallow-edition/ (on Z3/Z3C atleast).

> How long does the battery lost?

The battery life is really good, for my usage i always get 24h of usage with 5-6 SoT.

> Have you experienced overheating?

Nope, overheating only happen if you do some heavy stuff like recording in 4K, playing games for a long time. (Actually overheating on Xperia series only happen on Z3+ because of the Snapdragon 810, they already fix this Snapdragon 810 overheating on Z5 series with [adding double heat pipes to control thermal performance](http://www.xperiablog.net/2015/09/04/xperia-z5-using-dual-heat-pipes-to-control-thermal-performance/)).

> For those with duals, what is the dual sim experience like?

I can't answer this question since i don't have dual sim xperia.
They really good opened all kind of things that developer needs, but sadly you also need to unlock your bootloader and that will delete your DRM key and make your camera quality worse + some other feature will not work.

Installing 6.0 Concept doesn't require unlocked bootloader, everything is basically sony stock fw but more slimed down, the camera quality is same as stock and no sony audio enchantment settings.

Changelog:
https://plus.google.com/+JohnElstone/posts/8yFHSgSdtDW

> We have two features that will begin rolling out on Android today:
> 
> **Helping users free up storage space on their Android device:**
> On the Settings screen, users will now see a “Free Up Space” button. Clicking on the button will prompt the user to bulk-delete copies of photos that have already been backed up from their device. To prevent device copies from being accidentally deleted, we’re asking users to double-confirm their intent during the ‘Free Up Space’ flow.
> 
> Users who are backing up their photos in High quality may now also receive an Assistant card prompting them to bulk delete device copies when they’re nearing the storage limit on their devices (currently only users who are backing up at Original quality receive these cards).
> 
> **Deleting photos from SD-card enabled devices**
> We’re rolling out a fix that will allow users on certain SD-card enabled devices to delete photos stored on an SD card. This should prevent the issue of a photo continuing to show up in the Photos view despite being deleted, a frustrating experience for users.
> 
> We have one feature that will begin rolling out on the Web on Wednesday:
> 
> **Downgrade previously uploaded photos from “Original quality” to “High quality”**
> When users choose to backup their photos and videos to Google Photos, we allow photos to be uploaded in two ways:
> “Original quality” (large file, full resolution). These photos count against a user’s Google storage quota.
> “High quality” (smaller file, compressed file). These photos don’t count against a user’s Google storage quota.
> 
> If a user joined Google Photos and selected the “Original quality’ setting for their photos, but changed their mind, they could have future media backed up in “High quality”. However, for media already backed up in “Original quality” before then, users were in an awkward state: they had no way to downgrade that media to “High quality”.
> 
> With this update, users will be able to downgrade previously backed up photos from “Original quality” to “High quality” by visiting photos.google.com/settings from their computer and clicking ‘Recover Storage’.

Maybe something called extreme doze?
I recommend to get a larger hand.
I think he mean the amoled screen generation, afaik all the amoled screen on phone is made by samsung.
You need to try the concept firmware then, i'm running 6.0 right now. The only difference from aosp is on the settings app icon and some sony apps preinstalled.

http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/general/sonys-android-concept-marshmallow-t3229536/

I doubt they will never have at least 60% stable aosp, since so many dev didn't interested with Exynos SoC and their closed source documentation. Just like my S4 Exynos back in the day.
Nexus devices, Oneplus One, and all phone that ship with cyanogen os
They can use 1440p res on 5.1" inch device, why in the world they use 1080p on 18.4” ? for cutting price? or maybe battery life?


Afaik the reason why sony is slow providing the update is because they fix the bugs on aosp code by themself before sending the update to public, like the mobile radio active bug on 5.0/5.1.
Almost every Sony phone is fragile because of the glass build, and also cracking the device depends on where and how you dropped it.
Use a mouse via otg cable to access your cracked screen
Nope, its official sony android concept firmware.
This one is for regular Z3 http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3/general/sonys-android-concept-marshmallow-t3229030

Looking on your flair looks like you have an S5? on Touchwiz lollipop you still can see the battery history but on stock lollipop/marshmallow it didn't show up.
Actually anyone can install the firmware either via the concept installer or from ftf file via flashtool.
You can find it with the search feature to find wifi scanning setting http://imgur.com/PQ8Z61H

You misunderstand what op mean, the battery on Z5 is sucks compared to Z3c.
I found the workaround, just use search feature to find scanning setting http://imgur.com/PQ8Z61H

Does yours also didn't have wifi scanning always available setting on location settings? It looked like [this](http://i.imgur.com/9B0oFVE.png) on Sony concept compared to [aosp](http://imgur.com/a/l2imt) (It seems sony forget to put it there), and also do you have any issue when changing wifi dns? my wifi keep disconnecting if i change the dns

I will switch my Android version everyday.
Its sad but that's how android update works, anything older than 2-3 years wouldn't get software update, even Xperia Z1 is more powerful than M7 didn't get marshmallow.
Its pretty much AOSP with some sony apps, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fxperiafirmware.com%2F8-firmware%2F115-sony-android-concept&redir_token=D12uyWxZWFrM4fEm4zgbJGLrplp8MTQ0MzAxNDkwMEAxNDQyOTI4NTAw)
I'm pretty sure Z5 is running the same software similar to the last gen Xperia, the Sony Android Concept will be look really similar to stock AOSP but with some "Sony apps" like the launcher, camera, album, music, and video apps.
It's a pretty good timing if you buy it right now, It will get Marshmallow and the price is now pretty cheap, you will really happy with the battery life you can get with this phone.
U
That's also make me a little bit worried about Z3 series won't get N update in the future.
OG Xperia Z 5.1.1 update is a lesson from Sony to all other oem.
Still no official announcement news from sony.

http://www.xperiablog.net/2015/10/05/android-6-0-marshmallow-released-today-when-will-hit-xperia-devices/
The marshmallow update doesn't seems like a huge redesign update like update from 4.4 to 5.0/5.1. So just hope the update will come faster.
Can you show us some picture?
For disabling apps? Yes.
> the minor Sony UI changes are still there as an annoyance

I don't find minor Sony UI changes becomes annoyance since sony only changes the icon, and also you can disable small apps without root via adb.
    
    adb shell
    
    pm hide com.sonymobile.advancedwidget.entrance
    
    pm hide com.sony.smallapp.launcher
    
    pm hide com.sony.smallapp.app.widget

No, don't buy Z3v if you want software update. Just buy a regular Z3 or Z3 Compact

It's only one and it called Z5C, the Z Compact series using odd number for the release for every 1 year.
Yes it has

*Nexus 5X will have USB type c
Z5 series, too expensive? Moto X Pure, Want Google 1 day software update? Wait until the new nexus get announced.
Can you explain why you "upgraded" from S6 to Z3C?
I don't think it needed magnetic port anymore since the USB is now capless.
Its 0,3mm thicker than the Z3C, 8,6 vs 8,9
You can lose the DRM key only if you unlock the bootloader, rooting the device didn't affect the DRM key.

The Compact version using odd number Z1c, Z3c, Z5c.
it's still a rumor though.
And also it using 720p, slightly low power use.
Sounds fake to me.
Do you have the app link? Seriously thought I never heard about banning the device id on Android.
Did you use Xperia? You can disable the rotation of the launcher on home setting by tap and hold anywhere on the homescreen and go to home setting, disable auto rotation.
What app? And what error did you get? Never heard about that changing Id things.
The title is misleading.
> Although Sony's precious smartphone Z5 Premium has a 4K display - but that apparently indicates no real 4K content, but only upscaled.

Did you even read? The screen is truly using 4K, and it have upscaling technology to make lower res content looks just as good as real 4K.
Actually that will make your stock xperia nav button to stock Android nav button and also [this](http://forum.xda-developers.com/crossdevice-dev/sony-themes-apps/theme-xperia-stock-lollipop-theme-soft-t3083649) one seems better than that.

Probably, its fine on mine.
It's because the capless USB port, and its not that big the changes are only the looks, some internal spec upgrade (cpu & gpu), and new camera.
The UI looks different than the first hands on video, it looks more sleek and clean. this one is probably the final software.
Yup, that's not how converting price works 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3jdfg7/sony_xperia_z5_59900_on_sonys_website/cuoa95j
Sony: We will never launch smartphone with QHD screen, QHD smartphone screens are not worth the battery compromise.

After almost all oem release a phone with QHD...

Sony: Fuck it, lets do 4K!
The price is probably like last year the Z5 is $599, the compact $499, the premium $699.

edit: The price is 

* Z5: 599 
* Z5C: 549
* Z5P: 699

Cool, I have an old android phone and speaker. This is the perfect combination

Btw is there any way to use this on other android phone? so it will be phone to phone speaker?

I second this, but if your phone not rooted i would recommend CCleaner.

Woah just checked, Yeah it actually didn't need root but some function are not possible without root

Have you seen the Z3C forum on xda now?, there are dozens of custom rom 
What issue?
Fxp is really good managing aosp based rom for Xperia, look at their website we have Cm12.1, Aosp 5.1.1, and even the M dev preview
How about the software update?
Well, atleast it looked slightly better than any other OEM
Newer hardware, smaller size, slightly better camera, micro sdcard slot, front facing speaker, waterproof 

And ofcourse my favorite is how awesome the battery life is
Tl;dr from me

I love this phone in every way, small flagship with awesome spec & good battery life
Just wait, I'm sure about a few days or weeks we will see a port for Z3/Z3C on xda
What theme is that?

>When Marty arrives in 1885 and rips the fuel line of the DeLorean, causing all of the fuel to leak out, fans often criticize the film for failing to have Marty siphon gas out of the other version of the car - the one that is still buried in the mine and which Marty will one day unearth (and from his point of view, already has) in 1955. However, it is unlikely that this car has any gas in it; when storing a car for long periods of time, one drains out all the fluids (including gasoline), and Doc would surely have done this before burying the car in the mine (this is borne out by a line of dialogue from 1955 Doc, after the DeLorean is unearthed from the mine. He says "I put gas in the tank" - thus, there must not have been any gas in the car when it was buried in the mine). Also, Marty would not want to risk damaging the other DeLorean because it would leave him with no car to use in 1955, creating a paradox.

Lets see what will samsung bring

[Yup](http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/sony-2k-smartphone-screens-are-not-worth-the-battery-compromise), but maybe Z4 ultra?

"How to start awkward conversation"
*QHD, 2K is 2048 × 1536
Absolutely Nexus 6/Moto X 2014/Nexus 5, anything that run stock android or slightly looks like stock android like Z3/M8 Gpe
Looks like [Galaxy Grand 2](http://n4.sdlcdn.com/imgs/a/j/0/Samsung-Galaxy-Grand-2-Black-SDL175350551-1-64a6b.jpg) to me
Okay, i'm probably will choose G3 over the Z2 because G3 is newer, better and probably more future proof device because its still the best device that lg have
* HTC One M8 

Pros: Build quality, Have a gpe version (if you don't want to mess with unstable custom rom), HTC sense is also better than touchwiz, boomsound
 
Cons: Camera only 4mp 

* S5 

Pros: Better camera, Water proof, the spec is almost identical to M8

Cons: buildquality and it looks, touchwiz, full of useless feature (fingerprint, gesture, etc)

* Oneplus one 

Pros: Cheap, many dev support, use cm as stock rom, stock android experience

Cons: Extremely hard to get, Shitty customer service (it will be really hard to rma your device)+company, We don't know the future of this phone

and the rest of it

* S4 i9506: Less dev support, pretty old device (the official support probably ends at 5.0)

* Nexus 5: If you really want stock android experience with cheap price, take it.
i'm sure this device will still get Android 6 or etc

* Z2/Z3: Both have similar spec the only difference is the design and imo the Z3 is better looking

* LG G3: 1440p screen with SD801 seems will slowed down the performance and battery life

* Note 4: More expensive, The most higher end spec, more future proof device and imo i will take the Nexus 6 instead of this (i also like stock android)



Yeah, and the shitty dev support one Exynos 7420 for most developing country
Wow, is nexus 6 $1080 on your local store? i see it on playstore and motorola.com its $649 32gb and $699 64gb

Okay, i will recommend Oneplusone or Htc one m8 (gpe) only this phone have official stock android experience
or maybe you can wait a little bit until we see some new flagship on 2015?
How about the Nexus 6 ? i'm sure you will like it because you use nexus phone before and the price is also around $650-$699 + it will have many custom rom support
Sorry, but what do you mean?
Yup, Lg also do that too 

http://www.gsmarena.com/lg_g3_lte_a-6520.php

Simple, just tried action launcher 3
Probably yes, samsung rarely update their low-mid end smartphone

For example just look at the S3 mini, the last update of the regular S3 is 4.4 and the last update for the S3 mini is 4.2
Probably you will not receiving lollipop update from samsung, but if you want lollipop you can also try lollipop based custom rom on xda
So why they updated [this](http://www.google.com/nexus/5/) page while the phone is gonna be discontinued
Samsung product? samsung always say their new product is the next big thing
Its an android wear lg g watch
Not a nexus, not using google messenger, not using google now launcher and not lollipop

how dare you!
Actually google doesn't even sell the nexus 5 in indonesia, but LG does so LG handle the customer support
Yeah, i'm pretty confused because of that 

Oneplus one= Better battery life, better spec, but no in store customer service, bad customer support and i'm scared if something going wrong with my phone (broken screen, yellow band, etc) i can't do anything

Nexus 5= Update directly from google, with in store customer service is the pros for me

I've seen [this](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-F-K9Zf-jVg0/VGQ6YbV7i4I/AAAAAAAAAkU/gj5mZM1zdVA/w957-h587-no/postel%2Boneplus.JPG) on indonesian postel site, does this mean oneplus will comes to indonesia?
Sorry out of topic

Do you guys still recommend oneplus one over the nexus 5? (tell me the reason why you choose)
Yes, you have been missing something

Sorry slightly offtopic, what is your device? can i see your scr setup?
i'm trying to record mcpe vid with scr but it lags a little bit
And btw you can also try aosp based custom rom for your note2
Yeah, like any other said this new 0.9.0 is a snapshot there are so many bugs, maybe when official 0.9.0 released mcpe will be smoother, less lag, bugfree and more optimized for 4+ core cpu device. For now just turn off fancy graphic and decrease your render distance 

No, mcpe is running smooth on my exynos GS4. even my galaxy tab2 with dualcore cpu run pretty well
maybe its touchwiz fault, btw what rom are you using?

Hahaha same on my gs4, its playable but laggy 
What i do when installing new update is full wipe
Wipe data/factory reset>wipe cache>wipe dalvik cache>install rom and gapps>reboot
