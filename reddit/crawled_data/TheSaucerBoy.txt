No, itâ€™s definitely not a stretch. Thatâ€™s how it works.
I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the same for OLED, but in the past people have had yellowing while the glue on the screen dries. If it doesnâ€™t go away in a week or so Iâ€™d be concerned
I ended up getting the XPL HI U6-3A and some NRC16850 + a charger. I can see this turning into an expensive hobby. 

Edit: also thanks for the help. Iâ€™m excited (probably more than I should be). 
Will do! Thanks 
Iâ€™m jumping between that and the Convoy L6 now. Hmmmm
Thanks for the help!
I like the looks of that too. Might have to splurge. 
Doh. Managed to forget to look for the C8. I like that. With that I have to get 18650 batteries?
Any suggestions for one that would be a little longer?
Iâ€™ll look into those. Thanks for the suggestions!
That would make sense! Thanks. 
Wow that thing looks like a beast. Thanks. Ideally Iâ€™m looking for something thatâ€™s a little more slender because I stick it next to my hand brake and this wouldnâ€™t fit. Thanks for the reply though!
No, itâ€™s legal where I am as long as itâ€™s on private property and done by the property owner. Hunting with a spotlight isnâ€™t allowed but you can look at them all you want. 
The light itself is good, but it drains like crazy when Iâ€™m not using it so itâ€™s practically worthless. Iâ€™ll take a look at the list. Thank you. 
Perfectly legal. Iâ€™m on private property. If Iâ€™m driving at night on my property and see a deer I like to be able to tell what it is. Not gonna poach it.

You just unzip it tuck it in under the fabric and then zip her back up
Another option is to zip it away in the fabric on your roll bar. That's what I did. It's hidden and still has the same range. 
I think these guys here http://www.mopar.com/part/82210575AC are it
