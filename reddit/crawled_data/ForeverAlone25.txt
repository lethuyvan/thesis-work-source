Did you see her Alaskan Winter?
I feel attacked
She‚Äôs got dick all the way down to her toes
Maybe she thought if she performed well they‚Äôd finally let her free to her cat
Why are all of Delta‚Äôs wigs just varying sizes and shades of blob. It‚Äôs been three seasons now and she still can‚Äôt figure out what works for Ru :/
the ones who want to stay relevant
Too much Gaga not enough Shangie
It‚Äôs not ripping a joke if she literally gave it credit ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Referencing something and ripping something off are two different things
It was a reference, she wasn‚Äôt ripping the joke
Yeah I hope she doesn‚Äôt take herself too seriously and gives her fans what they love. But I guess we‚Äôll never know until they decide to film AS3!
I love how much fun Milk seems to have doing drag. I feel like some queens take it too strict and serious
Great. Cut. 
Pearl is one of the most polished and conceptual queens currently, but on season 7 she was not even close to Violet‚Äôs level
Someone has to go home first
I don‚Äôt think Cracker is confident enough to go all the way, she‚Äôll probably crumble near the end
Asia and Aquaria at this point are really the only ones getting anything close to a winner‚Äôs storyline. But that may change as they slim down and queens get more air time
I really think at this point the Vixen/Aquaria drama is more relevant than the Cracker/Aquaria. And if they want to send the Vixen home Aquaria might be one of the only queens who can match her high level stunts and performance level to send Vixen home
She woke up a long time ago goddamnit
Well I go to Pearl‚Äôs Big Ang over whoever was in the top with Kennedy and Ginger
Maybe 6 years ago. He‚Äôs fallen from the public eye
Well I think it‚Äôs easy for Dela to distance herself from the characters she plays because Dela is also a character separate from her own personality. When she‚Äôs in drag she‚Äôs almost always acting
I‚Äôm feeling very excoiiiiiteddddd
Milk‚Äôs AS3 was amazing
I‚Äôm predicting that Cracker is gonna have the same run as Pandora, Dela, and Katya, so I think she‚Äôs going to place fifth after being sent home by a lip sync assassin
I really hope this is the Vixen vs Aquaria lip sync they‚Äôve been building up to
Ivy could coach literally anything
Drag Race doesn‚Äôt differentiate between two runner ups. And if anything, Adore would have been second considering they filmed a double crowning with her and Bianca
She should audition for Drag Race she might get on!
Alyssa is the only one who wasn‚Äôt a winner or runner up. Truly an icon
Tatianna is THICC
Also these are really fucking good
First panel looks like a screen grab from the next Mormonboyz video
I think Milk is one of the only queens who can pull this off cause her actual lips literally don‚Äôt exist
When it‚Äôs right it‚Äôs right
Aquaria fell the most in the ratings then shot straight back up. Hopefully this is the start of her front runner/winner edit
Sasha Velour Part 2 the Rumix 
It was nice of Olive Garden to give Penny the night off
I hope Aquaria keeps up the boy drag! It‚Äôs something I love about Milk and Aquaria and their club kid inspiration
She‚Äôs a NYC creature of the night. She probably gets like 5 minutes of sun a month
The big hair and lack of padding is very suspicious. *them shoulders should match those hips, but they don‚Äôt*
Ok girl literally same answers
Mon√©t is the Alexis of the season. That promo look is not a good representation of her fashions on the show lol
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with costumey. But costumey next to conceptual, conceptual is going to win
None of Vixen‚Äôs outfits were conceptual with any references. They were costumey 
The lightning titties was a concept with references, it was well constructed, and it looked great on her
Does production think the viewers not realize the rigga morris and buffoonery?? Watching queens get robbed is never pleasant for the viewer
Well it is Lana Del Rey lol. Her voice and instrumentals usually sound a little gray even if the lyrics seem happy
Vixen
That would be a cool pageant idea for dragcon
I think you mean Warhol Ball
I feel the same way. At least in season 9 they could have fought for it, there was literally nothing Shangela could do it was straight up unfair. Shangela is the definition of a robbed queen
So kind of like the season 9 finale‚Ä¶ survive until the finale and the person who does best in the final task is the winner
A female impersonator who didn‚Äôt actually know much about drag making it to fifth is pretty legit I‚Äôd say
Derrick also made top 5
People forget how awesome she did at snatch game. She seemed to kill it when she really felt comfortable
You either die robbed, or live long enough to become the robber
Maybe Kameron will actually get airtime!
I‚Äôm sure they will on the night she gets eliminated!
Season 8 and 9 winners were both bald 29 year old New Yorkers. Too bad Mon√©t is only 28 she could‚Äôve cracked the code
The Pinkprint had Anaconda, The Night Is Still Young, Only, Truffle Butter, and Feeling Myself. She knows how to make a good album
Her entrance words, the ‚Äúvixen will fight you‚Äù paper, and just the way she interacts with people. She‚Äôs always on 10 and never coming down, and that‚Äôs just straight up aggressive
Her point was true but she cannot use it as a defense against what she‚Äôs done. You can‚Äôt say that you‚Äôre going to look like an ‚Äúaggressive black bitch‚Äù when your whole point in being there is to be aggressive. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just here to fight‚Äù
Melk*
Eight dahlurs
Aquaria and Asia would be such an amazing top two, they‚Äôre two queens who I see serious CUNT in them. And they‚Äôre both so creative and great at creating concepts which I love, I could see them being like Sasha and really doing a lot with the title
I for one applaud her bravery. Being a twink top is an under appreciated art
Vixen was practically giving it away anyway lol
Aquaria is season 10‚Äôs resident vers top
She did bring it up out of nowhere it was irrelevant to the conversation. Don‚Äôt antagonize someone you already have a problem with
That was a separate event. After that died down, Vixen just decided to start it back up again after Aquaria said an unfunny joke quietly that had literally nothing to do with Vixen or the previous argument. It was like 8 year olds bickering in third grade
It was bad the first time but then she did it again I was like oh girl
As an Aquaria stan Aquaria got it handed to her. The second time she was literally minding her business Vixen is taking the drama starting too far
James Charles tweeted saying he got ‚Äúmajor inspiration‚Äù from Trixie and Katya
AND not given any props
*Kay?*
Also known as the famous Cameron Ugh during her MySpace scene phase
I know someone who met her out of drag at Disney World. She was just straight up tan, mostly burnt I think
Aquaria‚Äôs like Pearl‚Äôs baby sister who just started high school and the hot clique of senior girls Violet, Pearl, and Fame have decided to take her under their wing
Oh my god you‚Äôve just awakened some deep repressed memories
And she made that jacket. Gagged
Touch the Fashion sold more copies than Reputation
Milk would have had her redemption arc and ended Drag Race on a peak, Aja would return and everyone would be happy
*Milk?* I love her but girl Drag Race and All Stars especially isn‚Äôt for her style of drag. Maybe if they did a look/fashion queen specific season
And Kitty Girls! Except in my fantasy ending Sitting On A Secret wins and Aja and Milk lip sync and Aja returns :)
*Milk*
*Betty*
Maybe they only want to cast one big social media star at a time? Aquaria this time around, Evan next hopefully
I love those Him boots
Not trying to sound too tinfoil but they were probably setting Bebe up for a win either way. There was a lot of questionable judging
I wish they‚Äôd actually talk about what they were packing instead of just glancing over three looks. Are they unpacking their looks or their life stories
This has got to be one of the worst drag race episodes ever. HORRIBLE challenge, mediocre looks for a design challenge, riggory in the lip sync, and a fan favorite is eliminated. Mess
Yeah they built this all up with editing like they were going to do horrible because of Vixen‚Äôs bad leadership., then suddenly she wins because she was the leader? I didn‚Äôt get it
I‚Äôm Mayhem who looked to Mon√©t who looked to Blair so I‚Äôm just there looking at the back of her head feeling as lonely as always
At her concert she sang Serial Killer live and said she might not be able to hit the high notes but she still did
All Stars 3 Milk and Thorgy was just the appetizer for this main course of drama!!!
Milk‚Äôs drag mother is here to show how the dairy queens do it
Greatest cast, worst challenges. The original All Stars 3
Imagining a clip of Abby at her first competition fresh out of prison and she spots the new fish in town who‚Äôs snatched all of the awards and praise during her absence, Miss Alyssa Edwards of Beyond Belief dance studio towering over everyone in her Future of Drag look ready to cheer her kids on
That was the gag of the preseason
If Bob knows she‚Äôs ugly and makes jokes about not being able to do make up then I really don‚Äôt understand what the issue is. Not everyone is a beautiful drag queen
Bob and Monet literally have a podcast together called Sibling Rivalry. They know they look alike, Bob knows she can‚Äôt do makeup. What‚Äôs the problem
So what‚Äôs the point? If neither of them are offended then why are you
Just say troll
Girl, even Bob knows she can‚Äôt do makeup
How could you say that when season 4 exists
Milk and Max welcome a new girl in to their club
I thought that‚Äôs what this was at first and got excited. I‚Äôm not a big Yuhua fan but I would 100% buy that shirt
It‚Äôs fun to hate twinks but it‚Äôs also fun to fuck twinks so get your jush and don‚Äôt fight the attraction
Aquaria
The new Sasha and Shea power team
This is how you do nails and gloves
I‚Äôm expecting she‚Äôll be a lovely fourth alternate like many comedian fan favs Pandora, Dela, and Katya. She‚Äôll snatch Miss Congeniality (fan favorite) and be back to slay All Stars. I‚Äôm calling it now
She‚Äôs short and broad, but toned. Get these cookies
Thanks Bob
If you say your drag is art, it is
Girl you me-me‚Äôd her ass to death
Bebe would actually have to have watched Drag Race and know references for this to have happened
Tell her to leave a voicemail
As a Milk stan, her looks in the first half were disappointingly mediocre
Sasha, Violet, Raja. Just cause I‚Äôm all about my look queens
They are going IN on The Big and Milky girl
I remember thinking ‚Äúwho will be the villain now that Milk is gone‚Äù and it ended up being someone who already went home before her
What I wish they‚Äôd do more makeover style challenges instead of these shitty acting challenges
Eureka‚Äôs such a versatile big girl with a snatched waist I live and love
Not really a ‚Äúbrand‚Äù as much as it‚Äôs just her attitude lmao
Gays love themes
Season 7 Untucked is one of the top ^(they‚Äôre all bottoms) best. There was the best mix of sisterhood and drama
I don‚Äôt want drama at expense of the actual talent in a talent competition
Mariah and Manila are not annoying!
That part
I mean there would be backlash because Kennedy won the least and was in the bottom the most. There‚Äôs going to be backlash if anyone other than Shangela wins though cause statistically she‚Äôs the one that earned it
Eye said I fell
But I think she‚Äôs a bit more mentally stable then Laganja. If Laganja kept her head together she could‚Äôve probably gone farther
The ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like them so they‚Äôre the worst‚Äù system
Yesss. It‚Äôs interesting that two creative queens, Thorgy and Milk, did pretty bad with the Diva‚Äôs challenge but were infinitely better with the Kitty Girls challenge. They were similar performances except the Kitty Girls was ‚Äúcreate your own character and write your own lyrics to perform‚Äù while Divas was ‚Äúperform to this character and lyrics we have assigned to you‚Äù
Yeah but she might‚Äôve been able to make the lyrics actually funny. Like Julie Andrews rapping call me mother, and Mariah Carey‚Äôs segment being 90% funny dialogue is what helped them stick out. Other queens‚Äò parts were just lyrics, so if you‚Äôre not an amazing dancer there‚Äôs no way you could really stand out
Drag Race was very weird about girls who were ‚Äúdifferent. ‚Äù I remember seeing an interview with Sasha and Michelle Visage and Michelle compared Sasha to artsy queens Max and Milk and all I could think was how they were screwed over in their seasons. Maybe Sasha just got lucky and production didn‚Äôt want to squash her early
Plumber pipe fish
Chi Chi looks like she‚Äôs starring in yet another fugitive spy on the run in a short blond wig film
Wasn‚Äôt the whole song about Alyssa‚Äôs Secret
They look like their college theatre group‚Äôs premier interracial gay couple
All Star 4 winner and her supporting cast, Milk and Adore***
22 year old with a fresh journalism degree starting her new career as an assistant at a fashion magazine!
Business fish
Southern Nights has one every week
7 if you count Mayhem
*fuck my city, right?*
Knitting with her toes
She‚Äôs crowned ‚ÄúMost Improved‚Äù even if the producers weren‚Äôt happy to see it, we were
More for the rest of us then
It‚Äôs Milk on estrogen
The makeup artist is pretty popular I think she goes by Milk?
Her fake tooth gap? It‚Äôs her thing, part of ‚ÄúMilk‚Äù the drag persona
Milk was eliminated but you see she didn‚Äôt spoil, she had crystallized and now she‚Äôs a glamazon bitch ready for the music video
An amazing and original joke. Darling, tell another
I feel like he‚Äôs addressing the kind of crap Pearl and Milk have had to deal with over the years, especially Milk since he‚Äôs ‚Äúcuter out of drag.‚Äù Maybe one day we‚Äôll move past that but the dickpiggery is just too strong
Trade did like the session
She‚Äôs shirtless‚Ä¶
Herstory is made as Farrah Moan is the first returning queen to actually win
If you think your drag is art, it‚Äôs not!
Southern Nights Orlando
Southern Nights Orlando
And guest appearance from Danny Devito!
She had to come make it clear
Erika Klash looks good here
Eliminated queens vs their eliminator was the most drama filled 10 minutes of drag race herstory I was not ready
Yes! I think Milk thought playing it safe would take her farther but she wasn‚Äôt brought back to be normal. Being different is what made her an All Star
The look was flawless and she was super funny. Sad she couldn‚Äôt continue but glad she made a turnaround and ended All Stars on a high note
The eliminated queens were hilarious. Aja, Milk, and Thorgy killed it. I don‚Äôt remember much from the Top 5 girls other than Bebe speaking gibberish
She redeemed herself by overcoming her inner saboteur. She addressed the fact that she was out of touch, and she was finally being the Milk her fans love instead of trying to be the Milk she thinks RuPaul wants
It‚Äôs organic
Milk can be hairy
Thank you! I hate when they call these two look challenges ‚Äúballs‚Äù when they‚Äôre not even wearing one of the looks! I thought the hello kitty ball was bad but they somehow made it even worse
Dear Katelyn: it‚Äôs Miz C, time for dinner
It‚Äôs honestly as if Bob learned how to do makeup. Attractive younger sister fish
You missed a 5000 at the end
I‚Äôm gonna need the @ for these dog pics
You really brought me back to that Untucked where Pearl shut Kandy wHo down
And a ‚Äúball‚Äù where they‚Äôre really only making one outfit
The truth is that 100,000 dollar check was deposited to her bank account. Wake up Murrhh, wake up. 
Crystal was robbed. Twice if you count Aja
Miss AutoMod just got Milk/Max‚Äôd I could not believe it
If a front runner loses I want it to be because of an iconic crash and burn, that‚Äôs good tv. Not because of production rigga morris
Uhh‚Ä¶ Milk has actual stans. Yes he‚Äôs hot but I love him for his drag
Is Five Foot Two Gaga‚Äôs Witness? Discuss
Dela has two standard silhouettes and she wore both of them last episode for the runway and then the lipsync
Selena sings live?
I thought I read somewhere that Naomi said she wasn‚Äôt even asked?
The Old Testament
Let‚Äôs just say there‚Äôs room for everybody!
All Stars is crafted towards the comedy/acting queens. And Bendela is good with looks too so there‚Äôs no way she wasn‚Äôt going to kill it. 
I got really high and fell in to this song. There are so many little soft sounds in the background it‚Äôs really amazing
Miss Chachki is getting meat on them bones in all the right places
Brand development begins. And great partner choice for Normani, Industry Plant is really popular right now with the demographic she would be aiming for
I‚Äôm feeling very attacked
I want James to feel my oats :/
Aja further cementing herself as an untucked rant queen
Queen of straight up telling you she misses your dick
Blue - Marina and the Diamonds
I couldn‚Äôt stop ugly crying to Ride at her concert
I wish she would‚Äôve stuck with her aesthetic, All Stars 3 Milk seems like a totally different person. And her mug was standard pretty face the entire time. I hope she gets to display a crazy look on the returning queens episode
Chicago produces amazing runner ups
Ya actually Gray! The full Ariana Grande Focus fantasy
I see her in person almost every week and don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever actually seen her eyeballs
She was he original makeup queen but many have challenged her. I think Pearl was the next one to really shake things up
I‚Äôm feeling second panel mole
I‚Äôm not saying Milk did amazing or stellar, she just did better than Chi Chi. If Chi Chi would have had a better look I think she would have been safe over Milk, considering Chi Chi has the injury. But that‚Äôs just not how things went
Ok first the wig was hot. Second, she still put on a performance that the crowd enjoyed. Chi Chi was a mess in nearly every aspect
Ok I agree about the Celine/Patti thing but how could you actually believe Chi Chi‚Äôs variety show was better than Milk‚Äôs? Chi Chi was undeniably the worst of the bunch
Weird considering the whole sub was creaming themselves over her about a month ago
Let‚Äôs hope and pray for a makeup/fashion queens all star season for Fame to slay
I think she would‚Äôve been perfect for the All Stars 3 ‚Äúbecoming an all star after the show‚Äù theme
Thankth thith
What‚Äôs Aja‚Äôs Snapchat?
And her iconic point to the left and legendary point to the right
Milk is getting a whole redemption arc in one episode. Maybe the editors can find a way to make Milk win so she can send Kennedy home that would be peak television drama
Milk is being THAT bitch this season. She doesn‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs the contestants, producers, or her inner saboteur. She‚Äôs bringing the drama mawma
Well here are a couple examples of what it‚Äôs like. I hope I can enlighten you
[Top Gun Large Coed](https://youtu.be/WTSCdziGMW0) placed third at worlds 2017 in the large coed division
[Brandon Senior Black](https://youtu.be/5Usz5nss01c) from my hometown :) took gold 2016 and 2017 in small coed
About a 2
I‚Äôm assuming neither of you have seen a level 5 or 6 all star team performance. 
I didn‚Äôt lol. There‚Äôs a world champion gym not far from me and did high school cheer for fun my senior year. I know a good amount of people who do all star
It can be very elitist and snooty. 16 year olds will pick up and move their lives across the country for a chance to be on a famous team
High level all star cheerleading is no joke
Or *man eats pussy* ‚Äúyou taste like Pepsi‚Äù
Thorgy and Derrick exchange looks. Thorgy hunches over and whispers, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre out to get us girl‚Äù
I just saw her in orlando and [she‚Äôs beautiful!](https://m.imgur.com/a/adkhl) 
Like, ew, Michelle
I don‚Äôt think Drag Race has ever had this level of polish and straight up glamour. Miss Liaison needs an All Star rudemption
Edit: other than Fame
A timeless and influential masterpiece
Milk is like the boss fight they‚Äôve been setting Kennedy up for since season 7. Milk is everything Kennedy hates in the young queens
I mean it‚Äôs right, all of the preseason elimination lists had Milk leaving first or second, which is already known to be incorrect now
I think she really feeds off of other‚Äôs happiness, and where ever she goes, people are happy. Lots of positivity around her I hope
So Season 7 Part 2 the Rumix? A bunch of killer look queens in shitty acting challenges
Drag Race: Project Rungay 
All Stars 4 look queen season. Episode 1 talent show is to just be pretty and walk around
Milk‚Äôs reputation has done a complete 180 in the last week, almost every comment I‚Äôve seen about her is negative, but also everything said has been valid. I just hope she turns it out cause she‚Äôs already shown to last longer than many people anticipated
Raven was obliterated the moment she attempted that death recline
You‚Äôre acting like Miss Ladder isn‚Äôt the secret 10th  queen
All Stars 3?
Shangela would be so proud of this Nancy Drewery
It‚Äôs all about embracing the materials
This goes against all the tea we‚Äôve been sitting on for months. I‚Äôm excited to see what else will be unexpected
Haus of Queens Who Were Criticized for Their Personality
These albums have such strong visuals and the melodies just take you somewhere. Honeymoon makes me feel like I‚Äôm floating
Stop this is cyber bullying I‚Äôm gonna cry
NURSE
üì¢We want Bangerz 2üì¢ I wish she hadn‚Äôt slandered this era so much, its her best work tbh
Alright Serena
Milk being the most unique feels very correct
Venus and Milk are both inducted into the hall of fame as Madonna
This is art MAWMA. Where do we make submissions for The Lourve?
But all of those artists drew inspiration from Lana, she planted the seed for dark, slow, moody pop music
Oh wow
I also ran into Laganja on Tinder! Seems like Jay has really gotten his head together and I‚Äôm so proud to see it, so proud
I got a Pearl shirt from there!
This is a breakup I don‚Äôt think I can handle
Jasmine Masters and a cosplaying fan
We all make mistakes
I think you mean Trinity
Well from experience a good amount of people that go to EDC don‚Äôt know anything about EDM
Queen of snakes and her two bald henchmen. One old and wise and the other young and ready to kill
A little tinted lipgloss and her go to Victoria Secret bra and she‚Äôs ready for the show
And loving every minute of it
Milk is so fucking weird
Probably not, Zander‚Äôs one of those accounts that pumps out viral tweets daily
I don‚Äôt know who but one of those has gtg for Trinity
She hosts every Friday at Southern Nights in Orlando! She has a lot of funny crowd interaction and has good lewks. She‚Äôll also pose for pics and chat with the drunk half naked local gays
I hate people that are talented and beautiful, this bitch is talented and beautiful times two. Some of us didn‚Äôt get any of it and she went in for seconds
All of them
Shh delete this before they fix it
She‚Äôs battling her inner saboteur to show versatility and vulnerability by covering her boobies
Bianca and anything that isn‚Äôt a boatneck gown
Pearl/Trixie and Violet/Max were so good ugh. And Miss Fame can beat any face to an exact clone like hers I couldn‚Äôt even tell who was who that‚Äôs TALENT. And then we had the amazing conjoined lip sync
Idk man. I always feel like a sea monster is gonna attack even when sober
I‚Äôve just seen a lot of hate towards her on Reddit and YouTube and I feel like so many people try and discredit her wins because she didn‚Äôt have any solo wins. Really there‚Äôs more to the competition than just wins and Sasha was consistently in the top and never in the bottom and her looks were aways polished. 
I think Sasha‚Äôs win is gonna be similar to Violet‚Äôs. People thought she was meh and weak compared to other winners but her looks and projects after drag race were all amazing and now people see how she deserved the title
That wig and plastic bag bow is a toot 
The wig and brown lips are giving me Pearl
The bitch birthed the glitter cut crease
Give her a few minutes of interrogation she‚Äôll get to the bottom of it
It‚Äôs what we deserve
No, you‚Äôre bringing up women to try and say how they have it easier than men when your point is irrelevant
No, he brought up women to try and claim they have it easier and men are victims blah blah. It was irrelevant to the point
Nice straw man. Your misogyny is showing
My gay ass knows the exact photo shoot you‚Äôre talking about. Had one of the pics as my wallpaper. A queen
Mr Fame for pit crew
And Miss Pearl! Come on season 7 look queens
When did Farrah ever give up?
Delta still leaving us asking for more
I think about this all the time. In Untucked the queens even said Milk was more criticized for her runway than the challenge performance and I think Darienne did pretty bad for both. I‚Äôm a bit of a Milk stan but I really like to imagine more of the crazy looks the bitch could‚Äôve pulled off
Cause you have to actually go outside for the filters
Cause she‚Äôs snatching that All Stars crown
That‚Äôs like my wet dream. There are so many amazing look queens that weren‚Äôt able to go far
Ew
Is this 2012? Who uses heavy filters on Instagram lol
Colleges have classes year round. At my university it's really common to get accepted for the summer because it's easier for freshman to adjust since there are less people on campus
Hey I start college Monday
I saw this on twitter a week ago‚Ä¶
If you've seen the way she's acting lately, she's definitely having some kind of breakdown
This 100% summarized my viewing experience. Except it was just me and my two dogs
It's @itimmythick
Crazy how nature do dat
I cruised into the top of my class thanks to most of my class being pretty dumb. I've put little to no effort these last four years
In the original video all she says is he's tall and needs to get an angle that shows more than just her head. I don't get how you could call someone a straight up bitch from a two second soundless clip
Delete this nephew
That's not helping the non-racist point
And Shanghai
Is recording a prom proposal such a foreign concept? A good amount of planning goes in to it, and it's a way for everyone to know who's going with who to prom. 
People always record promposals, why would they not record this one?
Could you really criticize Obama when our current president goes golfing every other weekend?
I enjoyed your joke keep it up
She did sell Cash me ousside merchandise, she was quick to capitalize on her fame she's been collaborating with famous YouTubers and "Instagram comedians"
Not just "meme status" she has 4.7 million followers on Instagram. She's building a brand
You're only 13, give yourself a couple years and your transformation can be really major. Just take care of yourself and especially your skin and you'll be a different person by 17 :)
A new phone doesn't come out for another 7 months lol the iPhone 7 just came out. 
No worries no one will be going to jail
She's my best friend from seventh grade. I'm a senior now
My friend, a grill
It's serious lol
aw shucks it's nothing special 
The original guess what was at 10:37 and she replied right away and I was just not ready
[her response!](https://i.reddituploads.com/e9c7dc7988ea4ab0800009f1c86f8723?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=d5fbee64edffbf5a6ced5c77554651ab) 
What you said but also I don't see her too often since we don't go to the same school. I mainly see her every other weekend when we party.
It's pronounced Meech like Michelle in espa√±ol
Mich is a girl
hecka
No
I thought he was cute :/
Just there for the world to see
You're definitely not the only one when this is commented under every slow motion gif
The iPhone hasn't been thinned down since the iPhone 6 in 2014. And they actually made the iPhone 6S slightly thicker in 2015.
Like I said in my other comments, it doesn't work on anything I try it on. It doesn't focus on the object or person and just blurs random spots in the photo. 
It has this same effect no matter what I focus it on. It worked fine at first but then one time I went to use it and it was like this and hasn't worked since. It's weird.
Yeah it does this same effect on anything I use it on the depth effect will go yellow and it gets blurry in weird places. If I try and take the pic it saves as a regular picture
Triple kill?
It's personally my favorite album. Every song is still replayable even after two years
"The sound of Ultraviolence was characterized as psychedelic rock, dream pop, desert rock with some elements of blues rock, soft rock and indie rock" from the Wikipedia page. It's pretty far from upbeat
[I've got the same thing happening to me!](http://imgur.com/doxxQov) 
I took my case off for 30 seconds in a cramped Lush and banged it against a pillar. It's ok but I just can't trust myself caseless with a new phone
Shook
Things were rough for my family for a few years, but last year was the first time in a while I got Christmas gifts from my parents. Then this year a few weeks before Christmas my brother got in an expensive wreck so no presents again this year. It's annoying when all of your friends are showing off gifts and asking what you got and you have nothing 
So people who stumble on the sub know it's a joke 
It's common New York talk. Not a bpt meme, my guy

I would absolutely kill to see her in concert :( but sadly she never comes to Tampa
Thins the head and smooths the skin

That show's like 10 years old
It's done all the time in cheerleading 
But you don't know them
I thought you said pissed and didn't understand why you hated joy so much
Plaid shorts are a no

Ooh wow I have a beagle weenie mix and he's exactly like that. He has much more rounded features 
But the kid in the picture is already 17 so he's most likely a senior
But he made it seem that the air pods were a necessity. They're completely optional
You don't have to charge the headphones. They come with headphones that plug into the lightning port and also comes with a 3.5 mm to lightning dongle. The issue now is charging your phone while listening to music
The phone comes with headphones. The wireless headphones are optional

 The illness actually doesn't cause my skin to dry and peel, but I had small itchy bumps EVERYWHERE. I had it for about three weeks before the bumps went away then my skin started to dry where the bumps were. My skin was so dry it was actually painful to move and the skin around my armpits ripped and I am no longer able to stretch my arms out. My skin has been this dry for about a week &amp; 1/2, hopefully it's going away. My scalp is very dry and dandruffy, which is  problem because people like to touches my hair 'cause "It looks so soft."
 And no, I'm not forever alone, my friends are fully supportive, but I'm still a little worried about my "image" because I'm a freshman in high school and school pretty much just started, and I have 3 periods filled with scary upperclassmen, including the head cheerleader/homecoming queen in my third period.
