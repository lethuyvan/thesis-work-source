I forgive my family their slip ups because they make a genuine effort and I can see their frustration when they slip up and their regret. 

When someone refuses to use my proper pronouns and they've only ever known the real me... they go on my shitlist real quick.
If you do some poking around in r/asktransgender you'll see us discussing them sometimes. They call for trans women to be horribly abused and negate the identities of trans men and nonbinary folk alike. Contra does a video about them that sort of touches on how shitty they are but it really doesn't show the real hate they preach. They ally with the far right sometimes just to hurt us.
Yeah it's kind of ridiculous. Everyone knows their team would do everything in their power right now, including time wasting, to get the win.
Navas MOTM
Navas oh my god!
Jesus Gigi you are fucking adorable 😻
Really fucking nervous, especially as a trans woman, for how this is going to go down...

Get em Nat!
They did a basic physical, BP, pulse, lung sounds. My psychologist letter was thorough so they did a short interview to double check and then noon. Prescriptions written!
Okay seriously though the suggestion for how to get under the lashes is good so if course my dumb ass didn't think of it.
Sister let me tell you about the magic of potato chips, you're gonna love em.
The response by the charge nurse is inappropriate and should absolutely be reported. Sexual assault can happen to anyone, by anyone. Nobody should be laughed at for coming forward.
Yep!
It’s legit and has the second patch on the right shoulder, just the way i laid the jersey down meant it got folded underneath the jersey.https://i.imgur.com/etRRJb5.jpg
Wut?
That’s a name I’ve not heard in a long time...
This looks like it’s gonna be a good game!
SKC vs SKC’s old players.

Forgot both Bunbury and Nemeth are in NE.
Hey everyone, selling these adult small Reebok premiers. Each is in pristine condition and I’m downsizing. I’m asking $45 for each, or if you are interested in more than 1 we might be able to reach a deal.

I usually ship on USPS priority mail which I ask the buyer pay $5 and I cover the rest. I’ll do international to Canada but would need the buyer to chip in more there depending on where it’s going.

Hope you see something you like! PM with any questions :)

EDIT: The Blues jersey has been sold.
Also there was an error in the title this is stadium series wild, not winter classic as they have not been in a winter classic yet.
No it fits like the normal premiers. In my experience only the Winter Classic jerseys fit larger than the regular premiers, the 2 stadium series I’ve had have always fit normally.
Hey y’all I’m letting some of my jerseys go. All of these are adult size small and absolutely pristine. Reebok premiere jerseys, and I’m hoping to get $45 for each or if you wanted to get all 3 I’d do $110 total. Hoping they can go to an enthusiastic collector!

EDIT: Also, this Wild Jersey is the stadium series, not a winter classic jersey.

EDIT 2: Wild jersey has been sold, thank you everyone for interest in it! Still have Flames and Blues.
I’m in Wichita, they were in the Ross off Kellogg and Ridge Rd.
Loved Top Gear but Clarkson is is a transphobic ass.
Awesome!

We have to pay the court and pay the legal notice fees to publish in the paper... :/

$500ish dollars to get rid of something I never wanted in the first place.
I wear scrubs and a thick-shouldered sports bra under a tank top under the scrubs. If I didn’t the boo age would put me more than they already do.
People hate those with the courage to stop being unhappy with a situation. I’m sure there’s a couple eggs there.
I’ve experienced something similar. Have to be in a good mental space and really love myself and let myself build naturally for this effect to be minimized. But it never goes away for me.
Holy shit.
Taking one for the team like this is the mark of a true fan.
Please don’t let them dim your light 💖 it lights the path for so many others 🔥
Hey girl hey you’re a $12er too? 💖💙💖 
Sweetheart your timeline is fucking incredible and those dregs of society can’t fucking say a damn thing to make me change my mind that you are a wonderful, beautiful, brave woman. 💖
No shit.
No Kevin, you have an opinion. We have science, biology, neuroscience, psychology, and basic human decency.

You see, your problem in this situation isn’t the same as ours, not can you really get me to believe you’re being persecuted in a nation where your god is literally fucking everywhere.

Kevin, you should, and I mean this with every atom of my being, go fuck yourself.
Holy fuck I love it!
My T is basically biologically undetectable prepubescent girls have more T than I do.
Oh Clarkson...
Serious point here, Contra has addressed this meme recently and that her dysphoria has reared it’s head again and talking about dysphoria waves. New folks starting the journey be aware it happens.
You are such a boy!
They don’t love you. You should not feel guilt over their choice not to love their child.
Pharmacy technician depending on your state, religious freedom laws fucking make shit like this so easy for the bigots to use and it’s fucking bullshit.

Okay then John no ED meds for you you fucking piece of shit.
Her story is incredible and highlights even here in Wichita, KS, we can thrive 💖💙💖
But but but TERFs said I have all this privilege!
You know what... they feel the same way with most health care conditions. In a society that so values money the system at least letting us play I’ll take while we try to force a more humane system.
For me, I kept parts and modified. But there is no obligation to keep something you never wanted in the first place 💖💙💖
Stadio Olympico will be fucking lit no matter what.
Tuned in just in time to watch Roma start making things interesting!
Be safe tonight Leafs, and fear nothing 💙
Let's get it going! I need teaching though I just basically have my crystal and cleansing it during the full moon.
I pet ALL THE DOGGO BOYS!!!
Rate? I mean I need a scale here but like 10/10 seems like a good place to start 😻😻😻
It’s been somewhere between... month 4 and 6 where I think I started noticing a change that I verbalize as “allowing myself” to feel like myself and allowing myself to feel and believe my transition will not be ripped away from me.
Yeah I’m not letting anyone touch this fucking mop for a while my hair is one of the most intense triggers for my dysohiporia.

“Oh if they mess it up it will grow back!”

FUCK YOU you don’t want to smash every mirror you see and doubt your ability to be seen as legitimate due to a fucking haircut that takes MONTHS to grow back.
Also.... changing your entire aesthetic and personality and suddenly you will be happy when the jock takes notice of you?
So I have not followed Spurs for a tremendous amount of time, only a few years since they played the MLS all-stars over here across the pond. However I have found that English media and organizers for the sport seem to be very... passively snide and unpleasant about players :/
Tbh this one is hard for me to describe but I would encourage watching Ted talks by women and watching how they move their hands. I kinda got started with that and then began watching coworkers and was able to learn from them and now I think it helps a lot :)
Oh my god there’s this one guy I know and I’m his cheerleader for getting on T and he’s taken 😭. and he so hot jesus christ.

I mean I’m fucking happy as FUCK for him and his fiancé who are so adorable that being around them could power a city off of cuteness power but also he’s so freaking handsome and sassy and such a boy AND he understands the struggle of dysphoria and coming out and the never ending battle for being seen as valid.
But that’s the thing a chaser ONLY goes for trans people because of them being trans. You are interested because we get each other, because our shared experiences allow us to connect in ways cis-people simply can’t connect with us.
😶 I feel called out
Well considering You have no idea where I was in life at the time, I’m reading this comment as being kind of judgy and rude. And since then, yeah done a lot of growth and becoming more confident in my own presentation to the world. And seeing as how I know from several of her girlfriends and SO’s she uses she/her pronouns yes I will use the pronouns she goes by.
Fuuuuck earlier this year someone I know is trans from her involvement in my city’s community was at the ice skating rink and she seemed really cool and talented at figure skating and what did my awkward then-5-Months-into-transition ass do? Said not one god-damn thing to her.

I’m still an awkward fuck 😫
Just want you to know this is a pretty classic egg experience.
It is NOT. YOUR. FAULT.

Your father either had a dipshit moment or was self-absorbed to not even extend a simple courtesy to his own daughter.

Alcohol is no excuse either.
I’d never seen or heard this before and Jesus Christ I’m crying right now I can even fucking put this into words.
No fault at all of theirs! But in the same way gender isn’t a big deal to them, I can’t comprehend it NOT being a big deal. I can’t BEGIN to fathom not questioning it, feeling like everything is at 100% peace.
I’m kind of reading it as “it’s cool as long as you don’t inconvenience me too much.”
You’ll die sooner of stress related effects from dysphoria let alone if it makes you suicidal :(

As for cancer, evidence is hard at this point to come by but regular screening and checkups with health care professionals means those risks are limited anyway.
Cis people don’t think about this stuff, not do they realize how gender identity touches everything. They are fundamentally different from us in this regard. They pay no more attention to their identity like that than you have attention to the beating of your heart.
Cis people do not realize how gender identity touches EVERY SINGLE ASPECT of life.

Doesn’t matter how they identify. By being cis they simply don’t see it. Because of that, all of our experiences are colored in a way theirs aren’t and here’s a fundamental disconnect at some level.
😿 bless you!
Oh my fucking god you absolute sweetheart!!! 😭😭😭
I fucking love Russell.  
Absolutely should have been a yellow.
This. And I'd expect the exact same from SKC.
Any time you go studs up you are a fucking piece of shit.
I have forgotten how good we look in white. The black is even better as a second color vs the silver we had on the old white third kits.
Just tuned in. Ready to not see another shot cause that's my luck!
If his patients don’t see changes he doesn’t manage them correctly and should be reported to his board so they can see if he’s confirming to current medical practice.

Source: trained in medicine, and fucking despise when docs don’t treat us correctly.
Her videos with Fiona make my heart fucking melt. Adorable!
I liked Underarmour. :/
I remember your first posts in hrt girlie. Can’t believe we’re already here. Loving your progress 💖
Learn to service top, people.
Trans alt-right person.

Like, the Trans Milo Yiannopolis. Her views are disgusting.
Fucking right. Like... anyone from Kansas isn’t surprised that this occurred out there FFS. Fucking EXACTLY where I would see this happening.
Orrrrrrr trying to piss off Pittsburgh fans.
Captain Checkdown part dos?
It’s going  very well now that I’m on correct dosages and pursuing becoming a nurse ☺️
Fuck. Yes.
As my transition is going along I’m having a lot of eye-opening experiences that, even though I hated being seen as a boy, reveal to me how much society gives to men and not women.

I’ve been stunned by just how prevalent general dismissal of knowledge offered by women is and how often mansplaining occurs. I knew on an intellectual level before but to experience it myself is very eye-opening.

On a positive side of this question, the support and camaraderie I’m receiving from women involved in my transition is just incredible. I can’t believe how much healthier my mental state is having a supportive network of people who can be emotionally I vested in each other without romance being a part of the equation. That part has been absolutely wonderful and I think it’s horrible men, as a generalized whole, aren’t socialized in such a way as to encourage that kind of camaraderie.
"You have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide."
Gonna need to see the scientific evidence on that!
I snorted.
Yeah I have coworkers who were stunned that I have any interest in girls... like y’all, it’s not that hard. Love who you love 💖
There’s something new in this... remember her tweets about dysphoria and feeling beat down? I think there’s some fire to her right now she’s ready to kick ass.
We don’t like to think we aren’t superior here... 😒
Coming out is terrifying! When you are ready you’ll know it’s the time. 💖
I... I think I just read poetry.
Speck presidio grip. Before presidio line I use the candyshell grip line.
... yeah no I wore them when i pretended to be a boy never fucking again.
I appreciate both sides of this having family in education administration and the delicate footwork being played with here.

Ultimately, you need to go to the school principal, probably the superintendent, and the district’s lawyer to figure out what to do.

Legally, I can’t see parents’ willingness or unwillingness mattering before the eyes of the law on discrimination practices in your district and state. Public opinion will be mixed. As a coach, you have an opportunity to use this to challenge you team to becomes better people and rise above prejudice. 

Ultimately, this is far more important than 1 group of girls going far in a state competition. As someone who was on 3 high-school teams that competed at state, nobody gave 1 flying fuck about my high school athletics career and I’m 98% certain nobody will care about these girls’ cThey DID care about how I learned to handle diversity and become a more inclusive human. This is more important than any competition. If your team wants to walk away due to this, you’ll just get to recruit a better team. 

She is not a man. Her brain does not process information like a man. She does not experience attraction as a man. She already lives a hellish enough life being in a body making the wrong hormones for how her brain is wired and is trying to pursue something that gives her life passion. I frankly don’t expect people hiding behind religion to understand scientific study though, to be brutally honest. 
2-way conversations with an emotionally available human💖
Jeez. Us. Fuck.

I'm jealous beyond words that your girl is with you <3
And have all sexual experiences occur as a girl and be cuddled as a girl and be called a girl’s name and look like a girl and wish I was a girl.

But I’m totes cis y’all? I sweat to god if we ever get time travel I’m gonna go back in time and slap myself so fucking hard.
Orrrrre he’s legit sweet and just wants to date...

At least that was me.

Then again have never been actual boy so...

Yeah he may be tryna sex 😶
The fact that I see it in LGBT communities pisses me the fuck off.
God I fucking hate ESPN.
They’ll fill. Doesn’t matter if it’s freezing we tailgate.
Probably a pen
Perry you cheap shot piece of shit trash
Backhanders rock!!!

Backhanders suck :(
HELL YEAH!!
Jesus Sterling...
That was pretty well done.
We will all choose you sister 💖💙💖
God, fucking Blair White... 😒
Thanks for being open to learning about us :)
Well that’s less than good
I can’t read it. It’s going to break my heart and make me want to smash things. 😞
.... 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Jamie Clayton, she’s fabulous and amazing.

And of course she did! Wouldn’t want to cast one of the biggest names in trans actors and actresses for a role ABOUT A FUCKING TRANS WOMAN!!

😫😫😫
Her heart wasn’t in it. I think she needs to get back to her roots, fuck what anybody expects of her. Go out there an make what you want Nat, and we will enjoy it because they are great videos and discussions 💖
Sense8 shows how easy it is to provide an authentic experience of trans characters when portrayed by trans cast. Not sure why this is so fucking hard for cis people to understand.
Well that’s just fucking awesome
So when does Philly just start dropping gloves and trying to fuck shit up?
Or turn your sliders way down ya jerks!
Didn’t *quite* make it halfway there Elliot.
Welp this has gone south for Philly.
Lol
Yep. It’s a thing. Also a far-right strategy to isolate us and make us easier targets. We all HAVE to stick together.
Pat themselves in the fucking back “see how nice we are e gave you your own money!”

Fuck these asshats
A-fucking-people 💖
Luckily this falls under discrimination and pretty much ever university protects gender identity so report his lazy disgusting pathetic piece of shit ass to the student advocate, dean of the college, etc...
Damn bringing up Bionicle feels...
An attempt was almost made.
Yeah the first is a Reebok Reggie Wayne jersey and the second is an Andrew Luck Nike jersey.
Yeah they are two different players, 2 different styles also.
💜💛💜
Uhhhhh yellow on headlock???
Don’t worry they will make sure you hear about him.
Let’s spoil this party SKC. 💙🖤💙🖤
Noice
Why do I get the feeling nobody is giving us a chance?
Nice! How do you think they will fare against the Sharks?
YOU’VE JUST BEEN PITTY-JAMMED!
I still remember his first game and how fucking excited he was and how the fans were FAWNING over him. Be brought passion and excitement and now it’s just sad to see :/
What an odd little trickle last the line!
Long, had a misspelling
😶 hai you is pretty
It took my life falling into a pretty bad shape to realize dysphoria was keeping me from addressing a lot of issues.

It’s hard, it’s scary, and it’s so fucking worth it 💖 if you’re in doubt try to find a gender therapist to talk it out, they may be able to help with fears and share experiences from the community you’re in.
What a fucking shithead.
Jesus Christ! 
Would not even be mad that would just be epic. 
Come on give the new girl a nice time 
What a fucking season for the Avs ❤️💙
Haaaayyyyyyy 😏😺
The butterfly rush of working on something and then seeing the girl you have a crush on has shot you a text. Just knowing she thought of me kinda thing :)
for All the support the Christians I know give to Israel, they sure do think like this guy and believe America to be God’s chosen people.
Come here, my brother. You are valid and a man, and handsome man, a good man. Don’t let dreams ever tell you you are not 💖💙💖
Despite being a vocal duo are for trans people avoiding going to ANYTHING or watching ANYTHING that showed trans people being happy because it brought immense pain about my future.

“But I’m cis!”

Fuck my best friend wanted to beat me to death my head was so stuck in the sand.
I’m not alone... 😦
What happened is shit got real for them and like cowards they decided that their comfort was worth more than your happiness and health.
Needs more catgirl but pretty spot on 
Between this and the Manchester derby I’m fucking done with referees.
AHHH! Hi! Ladies like you keep me going and show that transition is truly magic and I’m so excited to see where mine takes me and keep being you and being brave and living authentically!
What a load of bullshit.
HE GOT LITERALLY ALL BALL
Happy girl on right is best 💖💙💖
LAFC been watching waaaaaaay too many Ronaldo videos.
To experience that chanting would be hair raising.
Still love our little speedster and all his everything 💙
Beautiful
Absolutely ridiculous. He got the ball. Sometimes athletes run into each other that was AT MOST a yellow.
Why is Atlanta wearing their white kits at home?
They should have a moment or silence for the Humbolt team. The entire hockey world should.
United even bought the posts!
With United supposedly going to a lot more black in the kit next year, very cool to see Atkinson to be modeling the new kits for us.
Watch 2 minutes of stoppage be all we get.
Lol this ref is fucking shit.
Atkinson has completely fucking lost it.
Okay just saying “half a chest” fucked over my team in their playoff game in 2016...
Imagine if Sterling had finished those shots.
Ooooo yeah take a moment to breathe
Mine have reduced volume drastically too! I could never tuck cause of pain but now I can. Happy for you girly, thanks for brining this up cause it gave me something to be grateful for 💖
Just hit this yesterday with someone who was shocked to hear that I’m pan.
Looking amazing AND IS THAT A PLAID SKIRT IN OUR FLAG’S COLORS 😻😻😻😻😻💖💙💖💙💖
Right? I feel like the only girl who didn’t have her sling and waiting for it to grow out is a test of my patience’s like I never imagined 😭
“When you get the lead they lose all heart so easy to defeat United teams!”
Nice to see United so graciously making sure the City players won’t be too sweaty in their photos for winning the league.
Needs to spend more points in shot accuracy.
Like, I can’t do any better but I also am not paid to do it.
Mourinho looks so resigned and lifeless and it’s infuriating to me. 
Comeon now Sterling for fuck’s sake...
Holy shit what a fluid buildup!!
THE CAPTAIN NO LESS!
I adore dark socks with dark shorts and can’t figure out why but it looks good.
God been waiting for the thread!

Just saw leaks of United’s proposed socks next year more black in the kit design could look really good based on this look today.
Jesus fucking Christ :(
A stunning example of “every group has its assholes” in that they are a group, and are all assholes.
You did not sign a contract saying you have to be an activist when you were born. Some are made for it. Some are not. Sometimes the most powerful activism, fuck most of the time actually, is the quiet living of your life proud and well. Not shouting but showing that trans people live healthy lives and can do great good for this world.

Shouting and waving signs is not the only way to empower and to change minds. 💖
Pinterest, YouTube, and trail and error I’m afraid. The most important thing has been learning to use a light hand with many light applications to create the look rather than giving it a go all at once.
Trust me it flies and crawls at the same time. Congrats sister 💖💙💖
Girly, you are rocking it 💖
😻 well fuck I have a new goal. Chock that up as #569,396.
One thing to think about is how to work your makeup. For instance, avoid contouring, as it is designed to accentuate cheekbones. Try to grow hair into a cut that can shape and feminize the face. A pair of large women’s fashion glasses can hide parts of the face and send a message “I am wearing girl’s glasses am girl thx bye” and come in fun colors and prints!
I enjoy the hell out of it to be honest. Many people aren’t able to express their sexuality especially if it’s BDSM in their non-digital life. If this outlet lets them feel connected and true and accepted and loved for who they are let’s have it!
Good I don’t want those streaky 3D glasses to watch an even more expensive movie through. 
Hai fren. I saw your flair and wanna offer pets 💖
I am digging it, even though I’m not a huge fan of navy blue uniforms in general, this just looks sharp and clean. The helmet color change I think is what is tying it together for me.
True rivalry night is taking your rival down with you.
Freddy ❤️🖤❤️
Gender critical didn’t use critical evaluation of presented evidence?

I’m so fucking shocked. 
“She looks trans”

Seriously? This is how fucking low these transphobic asshats are sinking? 

Some people make me... grrrrr 🤬🤬😡🤬😡🤬🤬🤬
That’s pretty cool
6’1” is tough, and she is amazingly hard on herself. Poor girlie 😞
Someone’s eyes are bright now :)
Dipshit works too.
Best of luck! Welcome to the journey ☺️💖
I found a girl I like so I need to combine my City with hers someone teach me a spell to make that happen.
Didn’t forget Melnyk just decided the dollar menu was too much.
Both are fucking cute as hell.
It’s the curse we experience as we transition. Oh Nat 😞

Nat if you read this, you started about 2 months before me on hormones. I’ve been hitting the same snags in my transition. I just want to say you aren’t alone. I hope peace finds your heart.
RIP Juve
I only saw the red.
The hot cold flashes and some of the other symptoms are menopause symptoms, I had them when my E was too low.

Your doctor is wrong, and negligent to refuse to test your levels while still prescribing. It’s against both the Hippocratic Oath and most rules in states set by the Boards of Healing Arts about treating anyone.
I’ve found if I’m not in a place where I feel loved and supported, an orgasm doesn’t feel that great. It’s like an itch that didn’t get scratched. 

However... if I’m in a good place.... 🤤 holy fuck
From Kansas and believe me this ass-backwards hellhole will go down kicking and screaming. It makes me fucking furious.
Hey, training to work in healthcare, there should be patient advocates lines you can call. You can still report that hullshit cause it’s unacceptable. When you’re under our care... I can’t even that’s fundamentally against our codes to cause distress in such a way.
Hurt people, hurt people. 


I think most of the phobic jerks probably have a more complex reasoning to hate, not us specifically, but anyone in general. They lash out at us from the anonymity of their computer because they can’t address their pain in their lives. They are jealous of people who can and do address their pain and issues.

Don’t let them get you down. 
Oh fuck. I should have seen this yesterday. Cause it was not a great day :/
I mean, I know that I, without a doubt, am stuck in my current area until June 2019 :/ 
And the store will suffer a whipping loss of $6. Fuck that waste of flesh.
I feel like Phil in Hercules.

WOULD YOU STOP WITH THE THREE POINT MAKING THING!?!?
Guys just cause they call it the Final Four doesn’t mean you can only score 4...
Well I mean there’s 5 guys per side :’)
And people called me pessimistic...
Far above the golden valley...
Seriously hard the time they say they’ll show hockey it’s fucking poker, and then these kinds of cutouts...
A perfect start to the game MLS has salivated over all week.
Think I saw the black kit under the jackets. Apparently we no longer have blue kits for home games -_-
I love how I post I do like this and the 1 hyper-religious med student I know, instead of focusing on promising science, says “well that’s hardly a big enough sample size to draw any conclusions from!”

Well shit I wonder why many trans people don’t enjoy going to physicians... -_-
Can confirm once the self-care bug hit, it hit hard.
Happy TDOV y’all! From work where I’m not out yet... literally the ONLY place I’m not out yet -_-
If this had happened a bit earlier in the year we could have sent him to the fucking All-Star game!
Since it’s pristine I’m hoping to get $100 for it.
He photo of you and gf kissing made me start crying happy tears 💖
One person vs the entirety of human society? Pshhh TERFs... dream bigger ya assholes.
Getting concacaf’d in a friendly is probably the epitome of what this game could be.
True dat
Well that’s almost exciting...
It’s complicated is my relationship status with the USMNT but dammit... I’ll still be here.

Also the blue kits are pretty generic looking but when the camera is close I think the white kits will look pretty good on the field.
My view as a former med student: if you are in the US it won’t be a problem from a legal side, pretty much every university and medical school has non-discrimination policies that protect you. However, your actual experience with people will be varried. Medicine attracts a wide array of people and not everyone is that great. We had one student ask a trans panel how he could best phrase denying them service. I’ve had patients say transphobic shit to to me cause they thought they were safe.

Surgery in particular is filled with either the best or the worst people you can find. I worked with surgeons I’d trust my life to (and in fact have trusted my life to) and others I thought should be removed from any interactions with students. Anesthesia is pretty chill and laid back though.

However, I can tell you transition changed what I was aiming to get out of a career in medicine. A lot of male ego was wooed up in going after it instead of nursing. At 16 it’s impossible to draw a parallel to your life describing how ridiculously hard the pace of med school is. The subject material itself isn’t horrible but the pacing is basically inhumane. Most of my class, at a school that emphasized student life and their work/life balance, had more than 50% of us on SSRI’s started AFTER starting school, several people who battled SI... our exams for example were 1600 PowerPoint slides of dense material taught to us every 4 weeks for the first 2 years. And you aren’t taught. Med school is the world’s most expensive online course,  isn’t even close to enough time in lectures to teach you everything.

Spend the next 6 years or so shadowing every professional you can. Nurses, PA, scrub techs, pharmacists, docs, PT, OT... make sure you can’t see yourself doing ANYTHING other than being a doctor.

Oh fuck at the local university, where I got my undergrad, was on campus for something recently. Had to go through a door I must have gone through 1000 times in my days in famous with no issues. Go to open the door, shoulder slightly against and push...

And I fucking pushed *myself* away from the door. The door didn’t even *budge.*
Not quite 6 months in and it’s... noticeably dropping. I am noticing definite loss of muscle mass now and in particular, muscle endurance is shiiiiiiiit now.

Really? The party that colluded with a foreign government to win an election didn’t want to uncover their own involvement in treasonous acts? I’m shocked!
Darling, the fact you’re having this much struggle without a doubt tells me you should see a therapist trained in gender identity issues. Cis people don’t worry about their gender like this. I know that’s fucking weird to imagine, this is every day for us. But they just don’t.
Between steps 3 and 4 bot way better both on hormones, and switching from a 5-blade to a 3-blade razor.

This is where I want to channel my rage at the world and actually deal with the bullshit politicians deal with. Not just rage against us but rage against a system that destroys lives to keep all marginalized people ground under boots so a small group of the privileged can remain happy. I want to make a system where this is expressly illegal. Where it’s the law of the land. God dammit I want that power.

I’m so sorry you’re having to deal with this :/ but I bet the employed is banking on you not wanting to deal with them. Because I almost guarantee a decent lawyer could find protections in a law somewhere that would make this hurt. And whoever fired you deserves to hurt. That company deserves to suffer.
Shelton. At least Croizet gives a fuck.
Pretty passing in the midfield ain’t gonna win the game :/
Spoiler alert: he jogged towards a 50/50 ball!
Or when we let Latif go at all... I understood losing Benny. I would not have let Latif go.
Without a fucking doubt.
Body language and constantly getting out-ran to balls. I don’t need much to tell that someone’s a cancer, having played with them in various sports over the years.
Would be nice to see him not get out-ran because he couldn’t be fucked to get to the ball first.
Okay seriously could Shelton be any more casual? Really disliking him.
Shelton seems slow and moody...
I need this in my life.
Matt is a lead-by-example guy. There’s a lot more to being the captain than game-time huddles. Especially to a guy like Verne’s who runs his team to death by mid August.
This is going well...
Such a small change and it’s working for me. Love the accent on the kit collar. Exquisite.
Ilie with an open field tackle that could teach Marcus Peters a thing to two.
And it’s Bes, Ike, Zeus, and Seth. They shouldn’t be having this problem.
Zeus this is why you DON’T CUT THE FUCKING HAIR!!!
I heard that SKC Team from 2018/19 used to be good. Takes are told.
Well fuck.
The back 4 is so shitty so far this year. Obviously missing assignments and miscommunicating.
Primaries are typically worn unless contrast is needed. And it’s easier to sell a brand new kit to fans when excitement for the season start is high and they are the sexy new thing the boys are wearing.
I love it, feels like an attitude shift personified in a kit.
Fuck it’s weird not seeing the man-bun crashing down the right side...

He’s still me rugged perfect man-God but... the hair... :(
The black kits are growing on me but it’s always good to be in Sporting Blue 💙💙💙
Boy this is a quiet crowd right now. O.o
😻😻😻😻😻
Well you were on YouTube, pretty much a literal cesspool of bigots, MRA’s, and shitty people who think anyone gives a flying fuck about their worthless, insignificant opinion.
Slightly depressed/suicidal and hoping to get hit by the hand of god one day and stop having to feel.

Either/or.
💖💙💖
You started just weeks before me and I remember seeing you start and marveling at how gorgeous I knew you would keep growing.

Can confirm. You’re gorgeous :)
Wonderfully forgettable design for a wonderfully forgettable time in US Soccer history.
No more than a cure for being blonde. Being trans doesn’t significantly distress me as medicine allows me to deal with it. Society’s bulls hit reaction to me is what stresses me the fuck out. My nature isn’t wrong, society is fucked up.
That you are brave and beautiful 💖
My dad misses fingerprint scanner. FaceID is decent but... fingerprint is just better.
Yup.
Love it. Instead let’s support teams spending completely ridiculous sums of money to fall out of CL by parking the bus at home...
Watching your transition has been so gratifying! So fucking cute I hope I get to be half as cute as you 💖💖💖
WOOOOO I AM LOVING IT K-STATE!!
Friends there say he’s just good enough to say “could we really find someone better?”
C’mon Wildcats! Fuck the Wildcats!
Battlefront II. I will always love you 💖
Not in any way boy, and can I please take you out for dinner? :)
You forgot the PhD with an overinflated ego thinking his intro-level lecture is the best place to strut a big dick and force an important topic into a 90 second summary.
Members of a foreign government attacked American's exercising Constitutional rights on American soil and our government will do nothing.

Congrats Republicans, we're winning so bigly hugely.
That's not Rowling, that's her manager's saying "hey this will cost her money so let's issue the most banal, vanilla statement ever to make it so they can't label us as an outright bigot."
Goes right alongside the child marriage 👍
Legitimately being giggly :)
Okay seriously did we need to attack former me?
It’s a game. Exactly. Nothing to give a kid grief over.
KEY-OOTIE PIE!!!
I mean if you twist my arm like that...
Purr purr purr 😻
Hey pretty girl 💖 I’m sorry it’s a dysphoric night Lily. But you are valid, and beautiful, and so so so brave to keep fighting for your future. Sweet girl, keep fighting💖
Can confirm.
Are woman, look great 😻 

Source, am woman, think you look great!
I DON’T HAVE A ZUSI!
I love it 😍
FUCK YEAH GIRLIE YOU ROCKED IT!
You’re the girl I would see somewhere and be waaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy to intimidates to say hello to 😻
Cis assholes project what they would do if they were in the opposite sex’s locker rooms. Then they go and fear monger.
Disgusting personalities beget disgusting futures.
We still have such an immature understanding of genetics. Epigenetics may be even more important than genetics, with what parts of genes are and aren’t translated. So much work to be done potentially.
There’s a lot of things that can go into these matters, beyond identity. However the timing certainly is suspicious.
Contra is one of about 3 you tubers I follow and the only one I follow on Twitter. Twitter sucks for political discourse.
Emily you’ve been so important in my mom learning about this journey 💖💖💖thank you sister for everything and congrats on 2 years!
Even just if platonic this was so fucking adorable 💖
Funny way of spelling TERF.
😻oh my god soooooo jealous!!!
That hornet can stand heat to like 117 degrees F and the bees vibrate to get up to like 119 or something like that and cook it alive.
Eyyy dawg, Houston and us already have the place warmed up.
Kill it girlie!!! You got this! :)
Fucking epic 💖💙💖
😲😻💖
History of pretty blatant disrespect for officials. :/ definitely a bad tone to set.
💖. Sister I’m so happy you will be safe at work 💖💖💖
Lol
A very rare find!
They look so long on my giant feet 😭

Bobs, the Toms knock offs, on the other hand :)
Was when we went there in 2013. Best of luck Wildcats.
Hey pretty girl!
Pretty sure that violates that whole Bill of Rights thing about unreasonable search and seizure...
There are some... interesting design choices... chronicled here 💖
Smiling so huge right now 💖💖💖💖💖
Wichita, the city at least, has had some GREAT games.
As a trans woman I get why April’s title is provocative. I get it. I hate the word. But Nat is obviously going to skewer the fucking attack on men who are with us as men being gay, a statement that simultaneously homophobic AND transphobic against a straight relationship...

I mean... people hate hated on her Autogynephilia idea and then in the video she does a pretty good job taking the whole theory to town. 
It’s almost like when you ally yourself which Nazi’s when you’re a Jew, you eventually are thrown in the gas chamber as well.

Fucking idiot moronic hate-filled monsters..
Yeah I fucking despised the ending. Especially cause Indominus wasn’t a monster. From the instant she was born, she was treated like a psycho danger and when she broke free they try to kill her. Then when she’s smart enough to turn the tables we should feel for the humans?
CALLED IT MOFOS CALLED IT!!! Keep on Loyola!
FUCKING  CALLED THE UPSET!!!!!
C’mon former MVC bros you can pull this out!
It was WEIRD seeing us in white that year.
Fuck your parents, well done Heather 💖
CUUUUUTIE 😻
Contra was sooooooo vital to me coming along in all the this and getting more confident in my transition. Welcome, sister 💖💖💖
What a goal!!!
LAWDY LAWDY LAWDY!
But the base. The base just wants to “win.” They’d eat a plate of dog shit if a Leftist had to smell their breath.
John Fucking Higgins y’all
Everyone remember when Zona lost to Buffalo how embarrassing!! Who the fuck would repeat that embarrassment??
Nice sized crowd for being so far from Wichita 💛🖤💛🖤💛
Heckin no step!
The only one that I have ever known!
I’ve figured for a while they would, as part of Peter Parker’s growth ark, so we see the death of a mentor for him. 
... kinky stuff.
Could he be any more obvious about having Putin’s hand shoved up his ass?
For most a huge problem but for me... I’m a happy happy girl ☺️
FUCKING CALLED IT!!!!!
I’m very accepting of donations. Money is the only thing holding be down.
People hating since OU shouldn’t have been in the tournament at all. They did play a tough game though.
Damn I’d be bruised from that.
I don’t know If I trust many of the people in Kansas to protect me...
Right there with you.
SUNNER
9/8 upsets can be the start of magic :)
It’s the most wonderful time of the yeeeeaaaaaarrrrrrr!
I predict as the noose tightens around Trump that he’ll scapegoat us like Putin does you. Please stay safe :(
Jeeeezus girl! You’re so fucking gorgeous!
Hai pretty girl! 💖
When I read the title I knew which episode you meant! And it wasn’t the r Aston but I remember wishing I could change so easily.
How the fuck are people calling you by male pronouns? 
Because life is fucking weird. It's weird and frustrating and we can't change the past. We have the now, and now you know. <3
You are extremely handsome!! <3
The most delightful pain :)
Congratulations sister!!!
I think as MLS grows it will help. Getting people into games and experiencing the excitement of scoring in person, chanting, etc... they tend to get it after. Beforehand much more closed off.
Holy nutmegs
Young people don’t like bigoted pieces of shit.

It gives me hope 💖
Americans more bitch about diving and rolling in the ground. Especially USMNT fans because we have to watch the absolute shitshow of CONCACAF which is... pretty ridiculous with diving at times. The ones who bitch the most thought at just not fans of soccer and repeat the line ad nauseum cause they don’t want to learn the game. It’s frustrqting for those of us trying to get people to support the game here :(
Most of us in our early 20’s and up never saw anything about soccer except the biggest of big names and games. The sport is still relatively niche over here. So the biggest names get fans cause the fans can actually see an occasional game.
God that was close!
Chelsea look so disheartened. Can’t climb back this lackadaisical.
Arsene should go manage them!
Wasn’t PSG wearing all white when Barca came back last year?
Jesus I agree with Alexi Lalas on something...
Hope no matter who wins that the game is well refereed.
Well that was weird.
People tell m “her mom is so evil!”

That’s literally what peopleon the internet tell me at least once a week. That I should be institutionalized for mental illness.
No hugboxxing you are literally THAT cute. If I end up 1/2 as cute as you I will be a very happy girl.
Dumbledore‘ swans design looks different from the first poster. Much less Elder Wand-y
Oh that reversal was slick!! 
Jesus Nomi was the first trans character I could watch without wanting to do some really bad things to myself. It was right after I broke down one night earlier in tears in a friend’s arms cause I saw one more happy timeline and couldn’t do it anymore.

The scenes in the early season 1, won’t reveal spoilers, were only watchable once. I can’t ever see those again.
Let’s see it’s Wednesday now? Yep I have officially thought on every day of this week how I’d like to live either in Toronto or Vancouver rather than Kansas.
Tree! Hey, I just anted to say there are a lot of bad days in my life over the past few months but watching your videos ALWAYS makes me chuckle or openly laugh. That is awesome. And for someone not into some sports I also learn a bit why certain teams are getting coverage at certain times. Thanks for all the work that goes into these videos, keep rocking it!
I just have never been very fond of St. Louis.
It just said address invalid :/

I can’t find it :(
I grew up in Wichita, that... oh 2011-2013 time period games were EPIC.
God yes. An I-70 rivalry

Legit learned something new today!
If it was kik would it need to be a public group?
Hey girl! I just hit 4 months today. You can reach out to me if you need to!
Hi I would like to join for science too :3
Nope, I was just sad that we didn't get a hockey team in KC.
This is correct. He was taking Testosterone which brings him up to cisgender male levels. But because he was born XX, the state said he had to wrestle against the sex he specifically didn't want to wrestle against.
Trans girl here. Hormones, given enough time, do reduce muscle mass and endurance a huge amount to pretty much what any cisgender girl has. In fact a lot of us are on enough testosterone blocking that we have less testosterone than most cisgender women do.
Yeah... I was sad girl for many, many days :(

I didn't think you could be THAT arrogant after getting your ass handed to you but... here we are.
YEAH TUESDAY NIGHT RIVALRY LET'S DO IT!!!
Did the NHL not learn from Winnipeg's loss and reclaiming of the Jets that tearing hockey from a rabid fanbase doesn't really work?
I suspect the entire group will go down in flames. We are charging towards a Constitutional crisis the likes of which have never been seen cause I guarantee every top Republican was involved in the treasonous acts that assisted in Trump's election. 
Oh I was and am ALL about the jeggings :)

Since passports are often allowed as an official government ID for important shit, lots of people use them as a second marker with their driver's license since some states refuse to update birth certificates.
They can nullify any changed marker on a passport if they want though, cause they keep tabs on that. Pompeo hails not only from my state but from my district in Kansas. He's a goose-stepping slime-covered rat. When Trump goes down in flames Pompeo will go with him and I am salivating at the prospect.
Heck yeah!!
Well well well how the turn tables.
When you try to use the word “elude” and instead say “allude.”

Face meet palm.
I am from the district Pompeo was elected to the House from. I remember watching him debate his democratic opponent in 2010 or 11, Raj Goyle. I remember thinking, watching him, “this man will goose-step for the GOP like a wonderful little minion.”

I can’t wait to see him go down in the flames that are and will continue to burn down this administration.
Everybody expects the owners to act like businessmen and the players to offer loyalty for nothing. This is business. It’s a job. Get over it.
It sounds to me like he is cordial to your face and says the right things and when he thinks he is safe from your eyes he reveals his true self. I’d be wary of him from now on, unfortunately. Then again I’m not in this situation. Sorry this has happened, sister.
Oh my god this is so perfect 
😻😻😻😻😻
WVU over Wichita State. We don’t have enough experience/toughness for the press. 
NIT can be a good thing to build on. A lot of our current success started with the group that won the NIT in 2011.
Yeah living in the Bible Belt shows just how many “good Christians” there are.

Spoiler alert, there aren’t that many. -_- 
Just want out of this place.
“What insecurity/knowledge of yourself do you have that makes you assume everyone is just like you?”
I would say “can I please have your number?” Cause girl you are sooooooo cute 😻
There is nothing as insecure as masculinity.
Document EVERYTHING. Time, place, explicitly what was said, who was around.
I usually assume the assholes who use this argument against us are projecting their own shitty “well that’s what I would do” onto us.
Also cause, you know, she used to be far right. Now look at her. Much more open and bringing fresh perspective to the table.
If you’re going vintage with us there’s angry Wu, that’s just the slightly out of date logo used on here.
Holy fuck you are rockin it girl!!!
Win the battle and lose the war :(
People are awfully fucking brave behind a computer/phone screen.
Seriously it seems like all the guys in this area are either super straight -_- or creepy and the women are all submissive or don’t really interact much... When I was going to munches in my old city things worked really well but then life got in the way :( I just wanna be spanked and dominated is that too much to ask?
I’m kinda proud of you for getting it in the youth size. Crushing your kiddo’s hopes and dreams?
On the contrary, do tell :)
To tumblr, I will go. Good relations with the enbies, I have.
What a transformation! I’m so happy you look forward to each day more and more. Your hair is GOALS 😻💖😻
Now THIS is shit posting!
Johnny “Literally Arjen Robben” Russell!
Fuck if I know anymore. This year has been on Shaq's shoulders and Landry doing his thing. Connor is so fucking streaky with his shooting. McDuffie still has an immense amount of growing to do, he gets hot and cold pretty quickly. We originally thought this many guards would allow us to do something sort of like Kansas but it's just not worked out.

I don't think this team has much heart mid-game. By that I mean, I think they go in ready to go, but if things get rough mid-game, I think it really shakes them. I am not too confident in them making it any further than the Sweet 16.
Well everyone knows its coming but to play against it is just ridiculous.
And that reflects also year-to-year. As Kansas has put more guards out, they do better against WVU. Back when they ran a 2-guard setup it was common to see a KU player get stuck in the press and eaten up.
Well done KU! WVU as always will make noise in the tourney, the press will take people down.
I always have WVU AT LEAST making the Sweet 16. That press is a nightmare for teams not prepared for it.
Especially cause the tournament puts you against teams who likely have never faced that pressure. Whereas the Big 12 knows to expect it, even if playing against it is really hard. At least they have a history of taking it on now. WSU, for instance, would be in REALLY big trouble taking this on. 
Which is why these rapid-fire games one after another are so hard to win for this style. Players are just tired.
💙💙💙
We are at our best when first goal is scored about 55-60 minutes in. Can either defend for that long or score in the time remaining.
Yeah but US Soccer has no problem calling Columbus the cradle of American soccer and exploiting history there.

Absolutely ridiculous that MLS is carrying on like this.
We look like horse shit.
I am always saying this, but in the picture where you can be authentic to yourself, your eyes smile too, where before they didn’t. Your soul seems happy now.

I am so proud and glad for you, sister 💖
Have I seen this before?
Exactly! I don’t make it annoying but what’s life without a little obstinance? :3
As a trained biologist I would feel comfortable saying that pretty much anyone in the general public doesn’t have the education to be able to make any sort of authoritative statement in biology. Undergrad biology is he first time in biology as a science where you start getting into somewhat of a deeper understanding of the discipline, and even then it’s basic.
Oh the cis/het people...
Make. Your. Damn. Free throws. Shockers.
So like, how could I please you today? :3
OH LANDRY!!!!
Oh darling, riggers are every bit as valid as anyone else. Fucking artists.
If me being a rope bunny will count then you count :)
Hi Ma’am can I please just use all the words, Daddy? 😻
No hoping the subby cat girl horde is coming.

And on that note... hello :3
Yeah the way most guys behaved never made any sense. Also never made any sense why girls I dated hadn’t been treated in the way I would treat them.

Then: oh, it’s because I’m a girl. So mind blown.
Trans levels: maximized.

Cuteness overload: achieved.
YEAH THE “SANE” PEOPLE MOVED TO MISSOURI... YEAH TOTALLY...
As a trained biologist.... yeah even basic undergrad biology is the simplest we can make biology without basically telling half-truths.
That was an amazing thing to watch. Was so pissed Toronto blew that.
Yeah post-expansion doesn’t mean much for multiple of those years. Can’t blame them, it just took a while to establish themselves.
Hey Adidas this is how you fucking design a kit. Stop trying to be Nike.
💜
In some states if you self-identify as an atheist you can be barred from public office. They aren’t discriminated against.
Lol good luck NFC West
Lol it is fun and rekaxing when people brush my hair so was making a joke about brushing hair ☺️
Almost 4 months sober from alcohol.. Stay strong, sister.
But what if I wanna do the brushy brushies? :3
Yeah figuring out that it had been years, maybe a decade, since I just felt truly content and happy, was... quite the day.
Midwest, last IWD hiding due to having to get a physical for work that I’m not out at yet. 💖stay strong, sister.
Unfortunately people are brave behind a computer and and don’t agree with her stance that it’s okay to reach out. Fuck if you do you might even get someone to open up and change their views.

I’ve recently found her and when I found out about what happened late last year I was devastated. It was absolutely ridiculous that she was attacked for trying to spread a message of progressive acceptance to people who need to hear the message most.
There’s much, much more to it. It’s a warning to the danger of an oligarchy that doesn’t even have to pretend to do things equitably. 
Generally you want to go “no huddle” on offense.
Well they can but if the kick is “kicky” enough it DOESN’T count. Cool huh!?
Okay now a “goal” is then the little black disc, called a puck, enters the goal. It’s sort of like when you score a touchdown in football. You see Mychael, the “net” is like the end zone...
Ok slow down. Go over that again.
Okay I’m convinced Pierre has, for whatever reason, selected this guy as his heir apparent....
“OH SHIT I GET TO BE PART OF THE BROADCAST OF A HUGE RIVALRY, AT THE ICE LEVEL!!”

“Yeah you and Pierre will be doing some color commentary.”
Even fighting they connect to football Jesus Christ...
You can’t tell me that wouldn’t be an awesome broadcast.
Was just wondering that myself.
I’m so looking forward to being a nurse precisely for this reason!☺️
Welp, sorry y’all, might as well not even go to the dance now.
😻holy goals Batman!!!!
I mean, could have been a Rangers jersey. Serving backup to Lundqvist.
Yeah but “eventual trade-bait for a 7th round pick” isn’t as good of a title.
I have a tough time seeing facial changes for reasons unknown to me. So I was going through her stuff like “Somehow I won’t be able to see this” and HOLY SHIT!! SO MUCH CHANGE!!
Melatonin can help, and look into your sleep hygiene.
Constant white noise of dissatisfaction. Frequently seeing women and wishing the world would see me like them. It was constantly screening every individual as to if they would be a threat to my true self. Screening lovers to see if they could ever accept my truth.

On hormones it has changed to more of a “these hormones might change you a bit but good god look at “x” imperfection.” It’s insidious and evolves as I change to kill it. But transition is giving me more power to fight it and even days where I never hear it speak once. It’s such a weird thing and my dysphoria is all entwined with dysmorphia so... it’s a mess lol.
So, some girls are lucky enough, particularly the younger you start, where connective tissue in some areas is more malleable than it is later in life. The pelvis is one of these areas. I’ve noticed I had some pelvic shift and widening myself. I’ve lost an inch or so since starting hormones. None of that is guaranteed.
If you go over to the traaaaa sub all of us subbygirls will literally drown you in submissive cuddling the domme.

As for masturbation, the body rewires it seems to a more female orgasm over time, but it can take a while. I was stuck in, as you described, shitty little orgasms for months. I’m about 5 months in on E and T-blockers and I’m starting to see the retiring affect things more. For me I tend to enjoy reading erotica the day of a planned session to get my mind flowing well. That mental engagement is so vital to me now. All the physical stimulation in the world won’t do habit unless my mind is ready to roll. So i would advise read some erotica. Make this self-love an all-day thing with the orgasm just coming at the end of the day.
What do we say to alcohol?

Not today.
I was in a mindset for some time that I wouldn’t be able to look like the woman I imagined myself wanting to look like, largely due to a very negative self-image in general. So I resigned myself to being stuck with a male body. That lasted for a couple years before I decided i needed to transition anyways. And the cool thing is, as my body image becomes a bit more positive as the months role by, I can see myself body becoming the body of the woman I’ve always been :) Everyone has their own unique journey.
I started quite early developing breasts. Some of our bodies respond quicker. Congrats!
Itchiness, sudden pain when bumped into, slowly losing the ability to sleep on your stomach, if hiding in male mode can be hard to hide.

10/10 would recommend. I love my little boobs ☺️
I went there looking for a Thunder jersey and was wary when their photos were ones I’d seen online before.
Seeing a Rogue 1 gif here? A surprise, to be sure! But a welcome one.
Loyola-Chicago is going to be a trendy upset pick and I think that’s a reasonable call to make.
I have a problem where I speak in my femme voice and it sounds good with friends but around family or strangers I have a block. I’m sorry it’s a struggle for you too :(
The “motto” or whatever this year is “For Glory, For City”, and in the past has typically played up a “for Kansas City” kind of uniting battle cry. Although I’ve never heard the Cauldron referred to as “Cauldron City” the banner with that on it would imply “The Cauldron Standa with you” kind of vibe.

Long story short, we are Kansas City and we fight together.
The android sub does a pretty good job of acknowledging where Apple succeeds and where it falls short. They usually just want more freedom to fiddle with the software than Apple provides. 
More people are poly than you might think. 
Fucking Christ we have enough fights to fight without policing each other about “you’re trans enough because you do a, b, and c but that person isn’t really trans because they don’t do x, y, and z.”

The LGBTQIA spectrum has enough firpghts to fight without policing ourselves so vehemently. Let people live and be happy if they find love at all! Fuck.
Using this post to explain how I made it work and what people might be able to do in the US.

Mother hospital my transition clinic is associated with was doing a study on sperm count, quality, yadayada, in a wide range of AMAB individuals from trans people to people having difficulty conceiving to senior citizens to people with various autoimmune diseases. For trans individuals they incipentivized it by paying for collection and a year of storage, followed by a discounted storage rate in the years after he first year of storage.

So call your close University-affiliated hospitals and see if they have any sort of research program. The only way I knew about ours was a medical student working on the project did my history and physical exam(with my consent) before the attending physician came in to see me.
Haha I’m barely at “fluffy pixie almost to beginning of shaggy mullet” phase so I have some time to go :)
Don’t mind me I’m just gonna get lost with in those eyes 😻☺️
Bewbs! Congrats :)
Oh my god! I remember the photo from when you started the shaved side long side combo! It gave me hope that you can have whatever style you want trans still be gorgeous and valid and that was something that always scared me about transition. I’m so happy to see your progress 😊
I am so proud of you for getting 8 and going strong towards 9 ❤️
Thank you for taking the time to write this 💖
This. Plus when it’s really cold smaller crowds.
If they are on the ice, sure chirp em.

If they are out with family in the city? Leave them the fuck alone.
It’s funny cause I signed him on FIFA 16 to Sporting and he threw a fit after he was sold, demanded a huge amount of money. Played him a couple games then put him in the subs for a game. Demands a trade after the game.
I recall there was a whole war fought about being taxed without representation...

In all seriousness this is disgraceful.
Improved coverage and more providers robably saving people from suicide too. This is a really good thing.
Are you blind?
Eh our system has been inadequate for a while, we’ve relied on a lot of physical strength and stamina. As skill becomes way more important the league is going to evolve and we better move with it. 
Yeah but now look at all the money to not offer quite enough of to someone!
Granted south stand also has GA tickets
<3 u Seattle South
Sry bby best we can do is shoot the ball kinda at the keeper.
Lots of pieces gone this year so not surprised some struggles but gotta get these ironed out quick.
Yeah we’ll get knocked multiple times for it this year, Melia is a master time waster.
2 SUBS 60 MINUTES IN???

Oh shit Peter has been kidnapped and replaced with a doppelgänger...
That was NYCFC’s inaugural season.
Jesus Christ the back line is not coordinated well.
Yeah the second coming is nigh
The back line is not ready for play.
First night with the new kit, gotta get those jersey sales!
NYCFC had complete and total control of the game through the first 20 minutes.
Ravaged by age.
FUCK we almost ducked that up royally.

OH SHIT LOBATO YOU REDEEMED YOURSELF!!!
We typically don’t. Something I don’t like much. Like I get why we don’t, but it’s... not cool.
Illie has freakish body control, studs were as down as any player could have studs without dragging them through the dirt.
Oooo that would be cool, maybe orange socks with blue top and white or dark blue shorts
Would not be shocked.
Vermes, no joke, will bitch about ANYTHING from ANY point in the game. 
Yeah watching it his head was turned enough to see peripherally.  Don’t think he wanted to tackle your keeper, but he didn’t not tackle him either.
To be honest we hate refs so that would happen if the ref sneezed at the Cauldron.
I just remembered we SUCKED in the black jerseys in 2013... fuuuuuuuuckkk.
My only complaint is the indigo argyle behind the sporting blue argyle makes it look a little too busy. When we went to the white and silver alternates we simplified the argyle to 3 blocks and it was better.
Do you have... Sporting... Blue Balls? :)
Croizet could be our new tall bald white love <3
The Black kit is our new one so we want our $$$$$$ for all the work Adidas put into slapping some silver on a black shirt.
I had hope when they were teasing that the Silver wouldn't be silver but alas... I didn't design them :(
http://uniformcritics.com/soccer/mls/sporting-kansas-city/2013-sporting-kansas-city-ivy-funds-alternate-kit/

It's a beautiful look. I have a long-sleeve of this jersey. Very hard to find. Crown jewel of all my jersey collections.
Smart playing by Medina. Stopped a fast break chance.
Trial by fire?
Couldn't the silver have been Sporting Blue? We would have sold SO MANY JERSEYS.
Kinda like the no WR TD season for the Chiefs. At the end it was just like "yeah let's just finish it out for the lulz"
Vermes would call it a stellar season -_-
Divorce?
Yeah but $$$$$$$$$$
We've had a VERY dry Winter this year. Very little snowfall.
Typically our away section is in the corner opposite the Bud Light signs on the South Stand.
We have historically had very bad teams since the shuttlecocks were installed, although people tend to focus that on the Chiefs rather than Royals or Sporting. But since they were installed in 1994, most Kansas City teams are characterized either by bad luck with great teams, or stunningly bad teams. 
God that would be entertaining to see how teams adapt.
Symbol of Kc futility? Ever since they went in at the Nelson Atkins museum we suck in playoffs as a city.
Love the tifo 🖤🖤🖤
Sporting in Black, NYCFC in blue tonight.
Encourage you to get to CM Park someday. It’s epic at night in particular.
We are pretty good at home.
FSGO sucks always.
It’s adorable that you think we would score that much.
I’d guess black based on we always like to debut new kits at the home opener for that exact reason. Hard to tell though since both teams have a light blue primary.
LAFC
Anyone know if we are wearing Sporting Blue vs the new Black kits?
BARBEQUUUE, BARBEQUUUUE, BARBEQUUUE BARBEQUUUE BARBEQUUE
FOR THE GLORY!
Leicester was an anomaly, and you know that. I watch Prem every year, I just don’t care about it like I do MLS.
Jesus rain Batman
Quality is going up over these past couple of years.
Ha! Nobody would think to look in Wales!
Yeah who’s gonna win the Prem? Maybe 4 teams realistically any given year have a hope of putting it together? La Liga: 3? Ligue 1: 2? Serie A: 4? Bundesliga: 2?

MLS legitimately half league any given year could put it together.
I know parts of MLS are frustrating but I care so much more about MLS than premier league or any other league. It’s so good to have it back 💖
Brilliant save!
Noice!
Fuck I forgot Blessing went to LAFC.
Neither of these 2 teams is making it past the first weekend just switch to soccer!
Hey Benny was on TV! 
For a game of soccer sure are a lot of uncalled handballs. Why is the ball orange this year?
We love our Sporting Blue 💙
Oh now that is fantastic...
WSU hoisting a shit shot with seconds left of a huge game and missing? Where have I seen this before...?
CBS has never been to Koch Arena. Seems to be giving them issues
Jesus Loyola is leading the MVC??
Fuuuuuuuck
OH FUCK RASHARD!!!!!
I get Evans is shooting well but dude... playing through injury fucked RG3 up big. It’s not worth getting hurt.
Not sure to be honest but when a call is that weak I assume it’s a makeup.
Think it was an attempted make up call but it was awfully weak.
Only for Duke or UNC.
He will only leave for Duke or UNC I think, since he’s from Carolina, can’t remember which one though. The man’s the king of the city and I don’t think he would want to be anywhere where football competes with basketball for top dog. 
Bruce Weber to coach K-State for the next 8 years?
They are really fucking good but I was shocked to learn that when the news hit about the second one. Think that the first one is so close to the airport helps.
Sucks when the biggest games aren’t at the true home court. When we play in downtown Wichita once a year, there’s like 6,000 more people there but not even close to the loudness CKA has cause the arena design doesn’t have that funneling effect the roundhouse has.
HEY THERE’S SOME DEFENSE CONNOR!!
Yeah he basically has value only when he can make shots.
Yep
FC Cincy is pretty impressive. 
Top bantz
Well that’s not very nice :(
Considering the Sunflower is one of the oldest student-ran papers in the country it’s pretty appalling by SGA.
Also, I’m sorry, but did anyone expect there not to be some level of corruption in college sports like basketball? I mean really, is this THAT shocking?
Need Shamet to stay calm, need Connor to get calm. Need Reeves and McDuffie to make a couple plays. Keep feeding Shaq.
Hey y’all, Cincy I assume y’all would support Columbus Crew but SKC plays tonight at 6 vs NYCFC. Try to tune in, should be a fun game!
Uhhh Bardo said he wanted the meeting redone in a public forum.

Like, I get the frustration with WSU administration, Beggs was way better. But Bardo actually seemed like he wanted that meeting redone.

When I was there also SGA was a bunch of people imagining themselves to be Frank Underwood playing politics. Was pretty sad actually to watch.
God level shitposting, nice.
City won? Color me shocked...
ATTA BOY WILLIS!!!
It was in the MVC. Actually hurt is in the tournament quite a bit cause the tournament calls way tighter than league play in MVC and from what I can tell in the American.
When Gregg goes calm and motions you over... you done fucked up Markus.
I get the logic but it kills the flow which just sucks all around.
Yeah. He scary. 
Whoever made that last 3 attempt by Cinci has a really weird shot release.
You do realize literally every fanbase does that, yes?
When we would host a big game, and occasionally at UNI and Creighton.
I’ve been watching for 7 years and I can’t think of a single one.
In the same way you call a hay bale a “bale,” you call a bundle of wheat a “shock.”
Hey engineering schools unite!
Marshall doesn’t do timeouts. It’s infuriating.
In the early 1900’s our football players would farm in the fields surrounding the university. A bundle of wheat is called a “shock” of wheat. Our student newspaper advertised a game between us and Southwestern College calling us the Wheatshockers and the name has stuck ever since.
Yeah that was without a doubt a good call.
Oh the blocking call where your defense wasn’t established and set?
Yank on Rauno’s Jersey? Nope. Crash into Rashard’s arms, nothing. Don’t wanna hear Cinci bitching now.
UH FOULS REF??
Ball don’t lie.
Not even close. Your boy wasn’t established.
Connor may be the most nervous person in NCAA.
It’s adorable you think CKA won’t be loud all game. So cute.
LET’S FUCKING GOOOOOOO!!! PLAY ANGRY BOYS!
From Kansas, living among such stupidity is horrific.
Took off old leafs jersey, put on the alternate from a couple years ago. Goal scored. You’re welcome Toronto.
Had some recently and holy shit they are amazing!
Outdoor ice might be a little different too. 
Welp. This is looking fun :)
Especially when he supposedly is close with Russian elite close to Putin.
Adidas is known to be bold. The March Madness jerseys these past few years are... striking.
Especially cause they are, at their essence, pretty songs with good sound. They don’t need the frills.
I never heard the jerseys were designed to pay homage to each Navy. That’s pretty cool.
Seriously, it’s insulting.
Both anthems sung to perfection
All white... it is a look.
ALL RIGHT MOFOS WHO IS READY FOR SOME HOCKEY???

Right after 25 minutes pomp and circumstance.
Timber’s Army is always fun to see away! 
I was gonna post this! SKC here!!
Kings fans, since away jerseys are mostly white, and the kings are black, white, and silver, do you ever get tired of the monochrome look on the ice?
I’m a simple girl I see hockey is on and I watch it.
Oh that was DIRTY
Got damn such a good game, gonna come down to a shootout :/ let’s just do another 3v3 it’s way better.
Pretty sure I’ve seen replays where it did but I wouldn’t know who it was.
BINGOOOO how fun!
Hey Tampa just so you know, you’re allowed to finish a game in 3 periods only. Just making sure you know, ok?
A light touch and small hand movements is key. Also practice. It took me probably a week of doing it every day and examining how I would decide to change something each day to settle on what looked like a good sequence.
I thought makeup would be very hard. I’ve taken to it very very quickly and can “put on a face” quick as hell and still have it looking pretty damn good. Haven’t gotten the hang of heels, but then again I’m the clumsiest person I know.
Lots of people hopped on the bandwagon. Like good on them for going to games! But get a real one for God’s sake
Ron got shot because of lax regulations allowing an idiot to operate a firearm without proving competence.

He would be all for responsible gun ownership.
I was asked for tips. I’ve seen trans women who pass perfectly who don’t let themselves just be, as you said, and it winds up clocking them because they speak and move and act like their male characters. So just giving advice based on observations I’ve made.

Also some people don’t have the luxury of being able to perceived, before transition, as a feminine male. Some people grow up in environments where that gets you assaulted. So people train themselves to not be themselves. They don’t do it cause they want to, they learned to do it to survive. It can take conscious effort unlearn survival strategies. I get what you’re saying, cause for me it has been as simple as stoping using my pretend male persona and let myself be. Others aren’t like that.
FUCK having Hallmark on our kits. Ivy Investments is a KC group, and Hallmark can go fuck themselves.
2 actually. Don’t overdo makeup either in quantity or going beyond what you can apply well. Novice makeup skills can be a tip off. Second, watch your verbal and nonverbal communication. Women use inflection and pitch to indicate emotion, men typically use volume. Men typically communicate with their voice, women use body movement, hand movement, voice, etc... 
Around 3 to 4 months I was tired of having to pretend so I have gone probably 90% full time. Very few places I don’t openly present. It’s been almost all positive, the most issues I ever get from people is just them refusing to interact with me at times when I say hello or whatever to greeters in stores.
The league needs to implement some sort of program about Edmonton’s incredible run of mediocrity. They have single-handedly destroyed a generation of talented first round picks, miring them on bad teams and killing their confidences.
Your hair is goals :D 😻
Won’t hurt anything to try :) 
Yeah this is something that happens to all women, and is rooted in misogyny, rather than transphobia. That being said, I hear you and your frustration, sister.
I see a really gorgeous girl. Like make you trip over your words gorgeous. 💖
They’ve figured out how to get morons to vote on social issues and then enact true financial and political gains for themselves while blaming communists for stopping the coming of Christ.
> Well now I speak.

Thank god I can hear the opinion of someone cisgender. The poor repressed minority they are.
Between 24-26, hip and artsy girl!
What a gorgeous collar for a gorgeous girl! 😻
I enjoy not feeling like my phone can shake apart from its own use.
I thought they were overhyped but not to this extent.
Fun note now you know several of them watch transgender porn. You also know these guys are fucking worthless.
Great Shorty!
He sure looks energized. Can imagine lots of years in Buffalo can wear on you vs going to a team that year in and year out expects to be competing deep into Playoffs.
Sharks already in playoff mentality. Even winning big fierce fierce fierce defending.
The person who is wooing, I wonder what sounds they make during sex?
Yep. Classic rookie mistake.
Q ain’t the problem here.
When they hit the boards you could see a guys’ beer fall off the ledge and spill on him. 😹
Reactionary hot takes are why fans don’t run franchises.
Lol
I knew he played for the Sharks and I remember never seeing him make that much of a consistent impact.

Didn’t know about the Marleau stuff. Some people don’t age gracefully.
Why fuck JR?
If you want I’ll be gay and girly with you and he can go be miserable by himself.
Brutal, vicious, merciless.

Have a well-earned upvote.
Hahahahaha announcer’s curse.
If it makes you feel better they face plant against others too.
Mustn’t be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.
Never go full asshole.

Unless they consent and are into having a full ass.
I don’t think the occasional grilled chicken will kill him.
TIL grilled chicken is garbage...
Chara isn’t eating meat or dairy?

I mean what’s the point to life then?
City dismantled Arsenal. In other  news for this season, water is wet.
Make thine offer, Bruin.
Nice
I tuned in, Pens score.

Okay Pens how important is winning this game for you? Make your offers!
Jesus Christ I walk away for a period to do some housework and Boston is now up 8-3?? Got damn!
I know some of those words!
It’s always interesting to see how Oklahoma will swing. Like in football they swing to the Cowboys.
Yeah but I’m just going to read into this to piss off Houston.

HAHA NOT EVEN HOUSTON LIKES THE DYNAMO!
River City Brewery in Wichita’s Old Town is pretty good. I’ve been away a few years so not sure what else has opened.
I think that’s how it works. FOOTBALL NATIONAL CHAMPS WOOOO!
God hosting Cincy is going to be fucking LIT.
Gg UCF
Truth.
CONNOR FRANKAMP!
Zach is the modern Tekele Cotton. Tenacious on defense
For real  good number of us root for each other when we aren’t playing each other. We all acknowledge that Missouri sucks.
KU legend Connor Frankamp.
Multiple teams, players have CAREER nights against us jesus fuck.
However, a great example of why increasing goal size could make the game more fun!
Beautiful chaos!
He's... pretty good, most of the time. He is a pure shooter though and not great at PG. Kinda streaky.
Oh Bionic Burger still exists. Killing arteries for years.
Are we really? That's a good start!
I'm gonna have to get some medication the salt by the end of this game will be epic!
Fuck guys this is entertaining!
Hey Pens I'm waaaaay cheaper to let goals past me if you wanna put me on the ice.
Okay guys who set the difficulty to Rookie?
I'd rather Boston sports fans be miserable. Fucking Patriots have killed all good will I have towards their teams.
Jesus wind Batman!
Okay pens you got 2 minutes to even back up. I want a 14-13 game.
He come on and legitimately I was curious for a second how they cloned KDB.
Particularly important given the position he plays. Consistently being pretty good is very valuable in a defending player.
Big match this weekend though. Probably already saving energy for that.
Even if you hate City the beauty of their game... it’s true artistry.
Always chasing the perfect game.
Not at all. Part of life is knowing when to leave something with grace. Stubbornly holding on in the face of overwhelming evidence that you no longer have it is foolish. If he truly loves Arsenal, he would make way for a new face.
That’s something I’ve noticed about him. Even when not scoring he constantly is pressuring the back line and keeper, never lets them really rest.
Welp. 
Seriously, Ederson just a bit out of position on any one of several early chances and it’s a very different game.
Arsenal gotta stay aggressive and keep working. They can comeback. 
Well replay on my television showed his foot get stepped on.
Arsenal playing with some edge. Very entertaining!
You need a general target. You don’t need to see the whole kit. The City home kit is light blue and white. Blends into snow. Arsenal have a giant red block for a chest. It’ll stand out at distance in snow.
Well that was a beautiful strike.
I’m guessing snow, the dark kits would be more visible especially for long crosses.
Get off the computer dad!!
These dark green kits are so awful.
Seriously! The people who tend to rip us are the same ones one these rather classical symbols for their movement. I love the color pink, but I know quite a few cis and trans women who hate it. Yet every women’s empowerment movement has pink as its color.
Such a cool jersey! I’d be too afraid to wear on the ice though, I use old jerseys for that.
Can confirm.
Maybe the most important game of the year for the Blues. Either stop the bad momentum or slide into a really deep hole.
I feel like I learned a lot, and got some ideas for research I want to do into the topic, interplay of lead with multiple parts of systemic race issues.
Yeah usually it’s not the heat but the humidity that forces these stoppages, cause it’ll be so humid sweat doesn’t evaporate and players won’t be able to stay hydrated cause they just keep sweating. They get done with games and look like they just got out of a shower they are so drenched in sweat.
We actually have to do that here in the states during the summer for MLS. I think I’d rather play in freezing cold and snow than the humidity and heat.
Jesus fuck Spurs... 
Gosh I went all over the place for years thinking of a name that I would eventually want. Went through soooo many and none ever really clicked. Then I landed on my name because I realized I needed my name to be connected to something very personal to me and the way I modified things to get my name made it feel right. You’ll get there, I kinda like Morgan though to be honest :)
Oh my god you’re gorgeous 😻
Jeeezus.
The fuck is a treacle tart? What’s a jumper? Taking the mickey? Snog.
She played Umbridge impeccably, especially considering that from OOTP to DH2, the scripts got weaker and weaker as Yates pushed for more of a visual spectacle. She oozed Umbridge with every single second of screentime and line of dialogue.
No stop don’t... okay.
Yup
Defend your crease, Dubs.

Edit... Wild you gotta stop doing stuff that will injure your goalie. Thompson got pushed into him.
I wasn't particularly hairy but have very coarse hair. Now about 5 months in, seeing definite lessening of that coarseness and it's growing slower. I'm having troubles with the area under the belly button though. Thinking of eventually just getting laser on it.
From my understanding of HRT it can take a couple years for "max out" to fully occur. However since you're a year on hormones I think it's certainly appropriate to ask your doctor about additions that can be made, prior to surgery.
Walmart actually can have pretty good stuff now that's cheap, as can Target. I've gotten stuff at Five Below, TJ Maxx, Ross.
Fuck that was really good passing to set up that goal.
Careful you're gonna get a girl very hot and bothered with that kinda talk..
Jets, when y'all are in the playoffs this year and are doing the White Out, please wear white at home. It's so fucking epic.
Got ourselves a game!
He's having a bad case of pretendinitis.
Could be a good preview of playoff hockey tonight!
Yeah Melia should have been starting for the National team lately.
I’d be happy to pay MORE than current jersey prices if they wound up looking this good.
Really happy about Salloi in particular.
I always love it but unfortunately for me the amount of media I consume on my phone is high enough the plus lineup just makes the most sense for me.
I'm always stunned when I see photos of any trans individual, including myself, of pre-HRT vs HRT or pre-fulltime vs fulltime. The smile in the pre photos NEVER reaches the eyes. They eyes don't smile, the energy of the smile never breaks into the soul and the eyes show it. 

But the photo of our true selves, the eyes shine bright with energy as the soul lives once more. Congratulations on your progress, sister <3
Yeah but that population is the easiest fucking group to con so... make your money I guess if they are stupid enough to part with it.
You don’t need a C to be a leader. Comeon its one of the core lessons of D3 Mighty Ducks!
You’re alright, Razorback
OH SHIT CRIMSON!!!
Wut
Avs/wings, at least in 90’s to 2000’s. Devils Ranger especially during that same time.

Blues and Blackhawks is some pretty bad blood that feels more potent now with more recent success of both teams.
I can imagine, I’ll just continue the circle of jealousy by being jealous of you :)
TL;DR at bottom

I’ve been following you progress pictures for a while and to anyone in the community your collar is pretty obviously a submissive’s collar. Like, I immediately knew it the first time I ever saw a photo of you. I would highly recommend switching to a high quality delicate metal chain that you can give meaning to, your your dominant can give meaning to, and switch to that. There’s nothing wrong with elevating your collar game to one of sophistication for everyday wear and moving your current one into a “play collar” category. I don’t know if you have a dominant but it’s worth discussing with them. Or if you want something thicker than a metal necklace chain, look into a wrist or ankle style collar. If it’s something you want to not be able to take off, eternitycollars has some really cool designs for that level of commitment to the collar.

Your hair has potential but with how curly it is you could see if a curly-hair subreddit has any tips for how to wear it in a way that looks more intentionally styled. I understand lots of tighter curls are by no means easy to manage to I wish you well with that.

As for your makeup I would suggest learning how to up your eyeliner game as the very simple outlining looks somewhat juvenile. There’s a certain societal expectation for skill in makeup by the time a girl reaches her 20’s, at least to be able to do eyeliner and lipstick. Learn how to wing your eyeliner a bit an dbe able to make the top thicker rather than everything being a simple, 1-size outline that makes your eyes seem smaller. I have found Pinterest has lots of neat ideas for upping eyeliner game. And I would graduate from the pink lipstick. It’s rare that pink works that well IMO, you might try a red. Honestly, your makeup game does seem to be inspired somewhat from a cross dressing/drag inspiration which helps get clocked cause it’s not how women in their 20’s tend to wear makeup.

Scrolling through your photos about 166 days ago there is a set of you with makeup on and off showing off your favorite dress. To be honest, the lack of makeup or just very very very light makeup made you look so much more mature and sophisticated and allowed your natural beauty (because you are stunningly gorgeous) to shine so well.

Also, most of the internet fosters bigots to eat bold with their statements cause you’re nothing but a collection of pixels to them and people are awfully brave behind a computer screen. I know it is hard but don’t give them the time of day.

And ultimately, do what makes you happy. If you don’t want to make any changes, then don’t. That’s okay. Ultimately if you are happy day-to-day, then girl, you go rock it and fuck the haters!

TL;DR: graduate to a small chain necklace that can serve as a day collar and retire yours to play status. Wing eyeliner and don’t outline your entire eyes. Curly hair management research. Use a darker red lipstick rather than pink. Don’t be afraid to go with less makeup because you have brilliant features already. You are gorgeous and I hope you get good feedback here even if sometimes it is blunt.
I'm heartbreakingly jealous.
If you don’t want to drink, then commit to not drinking. Nobody can scare you into sobriety, fear doesn’t work for this. You have to WANT to be sober. 

However, since you ask, you should go see a doctor and get blood work done. Your liver likely is what is called “fatty liver” where it’s not working as well as it otherwise could as it detoxifies you day in and day out. Given enough abuse, fatty liver can turn into cirrhosis. For your brain, alcohol has likely impaired the formation of memories for several years now. Your immune system isn’t working as well cause alcohol makes pretty much every part of the body not work as well as it could. You’re as fucked as you want to be. You keep drinking yourself to death then you know what the endpoint is. Should you be scared? Not at all, because you can choose, right now, that you’re done with this.

You have to decide you want to be sober more than what you are using alcohol to hide from.
The most irrational responses people have had at me come from a place of hurt, most often from their past and they don’t trust alcoholics now. Just as we want forgiveness from people we have hurt as we commit to not making those mistakes again, we have to forgive them their experiences. Do you feel you are being responsible? Yes? Then focus on that and being happy. If your friend can’t accept that, then maybe you two are drifting apart.
Exactly! I am not committing to the next 1000 days of being alcohol free, cause that’s a fucking gigantic goal. But I CAN commit that today, i will not have that first drink. And then when tomorrow comes, I can commit on that day too.
Hey, I’m 25, realized I had a problem late 24 and should just stop drinking cause I was using it to numb myself to a lot of things going on internally that were hard to handle.

You can’t control the drinking cause... it’s just how you’re wired I guess. I mean, that’s how I think of it with myself. Some people are wired for science and math to make complete and easy sense. Some aren’t. Some are wired to see things in the world and can create beautiful art from it. Some aren’t. Some are wired to be able to use substances in moderation. Some aren’t. It sounds to me like you aren’t. And you’re not alone. Look at how many subscribers this sub has. Over 100,000! And I guarantee you it has many more lurkers beyond. 

It’s okay to not be able to stop if you handle it responsibly, which probably means drinking isn’t for you. I can tell you, my life is getting better by not drinking, and I think yours could too. I encourage you to reflect why you feel the need to get so drunk, cause you certainly sound like you’re not enjoying it that much. I encourage you to reach out here, to local AA if that’s your thing, or whatever you need.
I mean, very recent but losing to the Pens after all the excitement and underdog and fighting and fighting and fighting more.
Hey Rangers, you might want to tell Howard you DIDN’T take his mother out to a nice lobster dinner and then didn’t call her back...
Well that was a pretty Rangers way to fuck up with how this season's been going...
I would say a good contender but Howard's save was fucking epic.
Y'all need to keep an eye on the new tab cause holy fuck Martin Jones just made one hell of a save in the Minnesota/San Jose game.
Both of these team's jerseys are gorgeous modern takes on a jersey. Clean and minimalist and look very sleek without looking like they're trying. Very aesthetically pleasing game.
It’s peak 90’s it’s gorgeous
Howard what a save!!
I WAS TOLD 6:30 PM CST LET'S GOOOOOOO
Tell her a good way to help us to either squat or flex her thighs and legs as hard as she can for as long as she can. Activating the muscle in this way requires energy, which requires oxygen to work efficiently. This means those muscles need blood flow. The quickest way to get blood to those areas is to take it from areas that don’t need it, such as a random erection.
Basically see it as part of a larger attempt to rip away the pillars that support a white cishet male dominated political and societal structure. We threaten their view of how the world works and if something they think is so unchangeable can change, they think anything can change.

Which, many things can change. That’s what makes life beautiful. 
I believe so. It would be odd for a private to be that old and for a commander to have uniform with no ornamaentation.
Some days it is very hard for me not to hate a large number of people. Fucking bigots.
“Your mom is a dumbass.”
Sounds like a Blaire White kind of statement.
I’m so fucking fed up with this kind of nitpicky policing within our community. And for fuck’s sake of course that asshole would say this.
May peace find you.
They wouldn’t be able to make enough. Like, literally every fan would have one 💙
SHUT UP AND TAKE  MY MONEY 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Rocking it!!
Looks like her pre photo is 8 months pre-hrt so from that length to her current would be 16ish months.
And I bet they ate it right up.
Never  Fucking change Espn. Half screening a game with seconds left to advertise a game just starting.

We will fucking find the new game you idiots.
Warm up your memes, folks.
I’d want to insult Kansas by like it’s just any other win. 
Well shit we’re off to the races!
That was a beautifully sung anthem.
Pretty big game here! Gonna be a good one I think.
I think I can see thicker eyebrows... maybe some more shaping? Also, how’re your mannerisms and nonverbal communications?
If I’m trans and a lesbian and shorter and enjoy standing on tip toes with girlfriends...

Basically tell women are fucking awesome. Short girls are awesome. Girls 😻
I remember the first time I got catcalled. It was terrifying, degrading, and awful. 
I mean there’s really nothing to lose now.
Teenagers are old enough to commit to the military, but not voice their political opinions?
I agree, the wig is very, very costume-oriented.
Watching them play soccer on the ice. That’s what I want.
Admittedly it would be disappointing to watch a hockey team play basketball.
Anecdotally, I experience changing in bowel habits, headaches, orthostasis, giant mood swings. Anything you ask for hard evidence though in large studies is going to be hard to find. Most studies involving us have been small and limited to the physiological effects of HRT on clotting, breast growth, etc for estrogen and over on the trans guy side on hair growth and muscle growth, etc...
Right, I just meant a general plug for making sure people who choose to go to the studies are careful. Your article provides a good platform for that message because even in my small circle I’ve had to explain stuff to people. I thought your article was god 👍

Edit: I meant good but god is 😆 
I’ll just do my normal plug here. In med school, nursing school, and similar professions they are starting to teach epidemiology and reading stats. If people use alarmist language to describe big increases or decreases in risk be sure to study their sample size and their study method. And incredible amount of misinformation can be spread quickly by reading scientific studies badly.
IT’S FOR HORSEBACK RIDING!
This will either be a fucking steal for us or so boneheaded it isn’t even close to being funny.
I do not know why but today is a struggle to say no. Which is annoying.

IWNDWYT
I get warm butterflies-like sensation. Mentioned it my best friend and she was like “welcome to womanhood!” 
I feel like emotion and soul should count... it just... Zagitova felt so robotic and lifeless. Calculated and well done but no soul.
That performance had soul.
Well done Kaetlyn!
That was exceptional ❤️
State line, argyle, hoops. The peak of jersey design for sporting.
When adidas template’s harder than Nike...
Being a trainee in healthcare I vehemently stand against not keeping your physician informed. Hormones aren’t things to play around with, although others have had good experiences with PP. since you’re a member of this doc’s clinic, they have a right to know what they are treating and what’s going on with your treatment as it directly impacts the care they will provide to you.

I’m assuming oral estradiol. It’s a high first-pass metabolism drug. More E in means more in the blood to actually work, UP TO A POINT. More E is not always better. However the most commonly cited oral dosing I’ve been able to find is 6mg E, 200 spiro, assuming an otherwise healthy patient.

If you’re in an informed consent clinic, discuss your concerns with your doc. Ask for their reasoning, politely. If it’s a shit reason, then leave the clinic and go PP if you feel that’s best. Or don’t. I’m just a person on the internet.
My opinion is that is a pretty conservative regimine. I had 4 month blood work done recently with 1 month on the full 6mg estradiol 200 spiro and had my T well down but E was still low so we bumped to 8mg estradiol orally. 
 I agree! I have the choice not to drink, the choice to refuse those consequences. Therefore, I have power.
This was a big event with lots of planning and emotions tied into it. It’s normal as that comes down, I think, to question things and not be sure if you did the right thing. I would hope you can grant yourself some time and grace to relearn your body and allow your identity to reforge. As you said, you had made an identity which involved having a penis. Give yourself time to have your new identity form.
Having recently been through didactic part of med school, they teach us jack shit. So find your nearest trans clinic and ask the physicians there their initial regimens and speed at which they progress us.

Also you need your clinic staff to be as passionate and educated as you in terms of the terms we need, about things in our medical records, etc...
Tell them if they come to the parade they can clanga in support.
1. Being trans is no guarantee of being nice.

2. Many of us are pretty shy and guarded as a result of how we grew up. Some take a long time to come out of their shells.

3. Some don’t want to be around other trans people right now. I certainly have to deal with dysphoria and general self-hate after spending time with some folks I know who are further in this journey and there are days I can’t evebn begin to describe how much I don’t want to deal with that.

Everyone is in their own journey. It’s almost never “you,” it’s them.
Melody... that’s an amazing name, sweetie ☺️
Yeah but when you’re 4 sessions in and seeing significant hair clearing it is *soooooooo* worth it!
The good thing about this process is you only have to say no to 1drink a day. Just the first! So get yourself off the floor,we have all tasted the dirt at one time or another.
Instructions unclear, gently passed the puck to goalie during shootout.
I am thoroughly convinced each of these players could thoroughly kick my ass.
That ain’t interference.
Hey keep saying that good things happen!
They shouldn’t have retaliated but 2 blatant slashes away from the puck by US. 
Canada got FUCKED on that call.
Drive the knife deeper into me
USA needs to settle down. Look very nervous. Canada setting the tone with hitting.
Let’s go USA!!
Or (R)epugnant
Messier’s journey with Vancouver comes to mind. He’s undoubtedly a great player, but I think due to that saga a lot of us have a lesser view of him than we would otherwise have had.
Beat his wife if I remember and racism.
I will forever see him as a complete piece of shit.
LOOK HOW HAPPY😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
*Philly?*

I mean Jesus of all the places you’d expect...
Well deadname me and fuck me silly, now I’m sad :(
No jobs unless masters and even then not much.
I’m really having a hard time seeing what would get that response. You look like any girl I may see in a college campus. Eyebrows *maybe* could be a bit thinner...

Voice? Mannerisms? 
My friend just asked why my mouth dropped open.

You’re really, seriously, amazingly cute 😻
Well about every 5 weeks I experience some PMS style symptoms, and I’m not alone in that.

However I do not bleed, so not a period. But those symptoms of nausea, bloating, changes in GI tract functioning, some pretty intense headaches... that does happen for me.
I view it as a necessary evil and when I can finally have what my brain was supposed to have for its body, I will.

Until then it can stay.
Fuck everything
We are so fucked...
FUCK
Hey now...

Best out of 5 flips.
We’re gonna blow it in a fucking shootout fucking Christ...
FUUUUUUUUUCK so close
Losers play for bronze?
Are you me?
They were passing to try to get the Czech defense to move to create confusion in front of the net. The Czechs placed themselves such that they helped cut off shooting lanes and the goalie had good views. So they kept passing hoping someone would move.
Da FUCK was that power play?
Can’t see why it wouldn’t.
Don’t slash a stick out of his hands if you don’t want a penalty you fucking ding dong.
Diving diving diving. Almost as impressive as Barca’s diving today.
“I’ll show you speed and pace not being there!”
4v4 on Olympic ice Jesus.
Great hit!
This has been a fantastically impotent powerplay.
Tulsa oilers! How you guys doing this year? Thunder fan here but haven’t been able to keep up much lately,
Anyone else think the USA shield plus USA wordmark on our jerseys is just stupidly redundant?
I’m on the sober wagon but watching at home. Doing as good as I can!
Lovers, kept apart by their families, longing for the day they can be together once more...
I am 100% certain we will never win an AFC championship game with Reid. I’m 95% certain we will never even make that game with Reid.
BOY ISNT THAT JUST FUCKING FANTASTIC NOW REALLY FUCKING GREAT
For me it was the case. The girls I dated were all basically what I’m going to wind up looking like in a year or two.
This is a horrific nightmare for me... I have an extremely difficult time trusting people touching my hair. 
need all that performance to ride someone’s ass on the morning commute, huh?
Congrats on making high school football captain, you’re definitely not peaking young!
Furthest off road it’s ever been.
“So what kind of car are you driving these days?”

“Oh it’s a Nissan 3...”

“Cool...”
So nice of that truck to carry it around so it doesn’t get too dirty.

Alfa’s, gotta love em 💖
Trust me, honey, kinky as fuck over here. I totally get the teasing scene even if it wasn’t for me. You be your beautiful trans, and unrelatedly, kinky self.
3 minutes seems... generous... to Barca.
Fuckin Spanish thinking they can do it better...
We have multiple snipers I repeat multiple snipers at Stamford Bridge!
Bold. I like it.
That was off Barca.
Get your actual values, there’s no reason for the doc to hide it.
... I see girl box...

Am catgirl...

Okay I fits I sits ☺️😻😻😻
Look if they make me drop to my knees and call me “good girl” I wanna be theirs. Boy, girl, both, neither... I want to make them feel good no matter what. Realizing that I’m probably pan has been an unexpected but not unwelcome part of this journey.
I developed very quickly to be honest. Like by 2 months nipples were pretty puffy and awkward. Now 4.5 months in... topless days are behind me. Couldn’t be happier about it :)
I’m a simple girl, I see Contra and I upvote.
Also lost my ability to get erect. Cause I’m a sex addict pervert...

It’s almost like these morons who says this about us have no knowledge of being trans...
ContraPoints, and she is amazing 💖💙💖
Believe in yourselves guys! Licking at the right time. Time to take down the Czech’s.
When KU has their swagger in a rocking AFH it is a sight unlike any other.
Yeah... ☺️
I prefer the World Cup of hockey stuff to this. At least the white ones from that set felt somewhat like a real USA jersey.
On Olympic ice no less.
Jesus fuck ref call a FUCKING CROSSCHECK!!!
Dive your way to a goal, noice...
Got a second look holy dive Batman. I’ve had worse slashes on open skin while playing road hockey.
Never respond like that dude, come on...
Light it up!!
To this day I can’t stand that we always wear white helmets with dark uniforms. It’s why I actually prefer our whites.
The fact that Nike made all the uniforms look the same shouldn’t surprise me with their soccer kit decisions but still... so fucking lazy.
Holy fuck you look it too girly!!!!
THANK YOU!!
Can only hear this in Liam Neeson’s voice.
Oh fuck Theryn was from THAT shitshow?? I’m trans so well aware of the shit Blair white spews. I’ve gone back through Natalie’s tweets and it fucking broke my heart reading how people turned on her when she was trying to reach people who otherwise wouldn’t hear our viewpoints. 

I wish i could tell her how brave I think she is for how willing she is to walk into lions dens to educate and further progressive views. Thank you for taking the time to explain that to me.
Jesus I fucking hate it. We were sooooooooo close...
I can’t fathom not staying for Teemu Selanne...
Vancouver leader and team legend, Mark Messier?
So, for a Contra noob, what is the deal with Theryn?

So much of a noob I didn’t know who hbomberguy was until that stream so very new to all this.
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

Apparently for Wigan also make 100% of shots they do take.
"Aguero, after being harassed, responds to person who surely feels he should be allowed to fuck with people with impunity"

Not as snappy as a title I guess.
Not to mention, Killmonger is one of the best representations of the idea that “we create our own monsters.” Even if someone does something good, great sadness and even evil can come from the result. And that in the eyes of Killmonger, as in the eyes of so many who have sought to overthrow power in history, they believed they were righteous and righting a great evil visited not only upon them personally, but upon their people as a collective identity. This is extremely humanizing for a villain. Thanos likely will not be able to have this kind of human backstory. Killmonger is a villain that currently exists all around the world.

I was pretty into weight lifting, and I'm 4.5 months into my medical transition. I'm noticing a noticeable reduction in strength and beginning to lose muscle mass in my upper body. I can still lift many of the things I could before, but it takes considerably more effort and my endurance to hold it is way less.

Emotionally, I'm so much more in tune with my feelings. I feel like I'm feeling like a human is supposed to feel, rather than the dead emotions and soul I had before E and androgen blockers. I cry more, and in a healthy manner. However it catches me by surprise. Watching Black Panther yesterday there was a scene where I felt myself tearing up and I remember thinking "fucking E, estrogen things are happening" and being so fucking happy I feel again. I smile way more I feel. I giggle and laugh easier. I dance badly to songs on the radio cause I feel like it. It's good stuff :)
OH WITHOUT A DOUBT. IT'S PROBABLY LIKE A JOURNEY THROUGH INTERNET HISTORY.
See I've only gotten "that's because you're a man."

Honey, I was never fucking masculine enough to be called that but I appreciate that you thought that much of my basically non-existent masculinity. Still was a proud day. My first internet anonymous transphobic comment. I finally felt like a real girl <3
Am from Kansas. This fucking legislature... the voting practices of the state... I want to stay here and work in healthcare to advance LGBTQIA+ care in the state and advocate for us. However, I am also really fucking tired of people actively trying to say I shouldn't exist and the science backing me up is somehow an "ideology" but their religion (this one is the true one, we promise we got it right this time!) isn't. 

Fuck the GOP, cause I haven't said that this hour.
Every time I get a craving I remind myself that it's not one drink. I would want the next and the next and the next, cause my brain for whatever reason was wired that way. But I say no to that first drink. Then I don't even have to worry about the others, cause they can only exist in a world where the first one occurs.
At best, family can have a hard time "seeing" change. My family is super-accepting and they struggle at times cause they see me decently often. However close friends who I trust to be harsh when it's needed have said I'm changing dramatically already with softening of features.

At worst, they are trying to plant seeds of doubt.

Girl, you are gorgeous and you are valuable and you are valid. When I look at this photo of you, I see not one iota of boy. I see a girl who deserves love and acceptance.
I've been going from completely shaved off to where it is now, teetering between shaggy mop and longer pixie cut. I've had one trim up to alter the length from back to front, and besides that I'm just letting it go for now while I'm in a position where people just don't care. Then again, I'm largely out so people I know are well aware I'm working on getting it grown out.

As for taking care of it: I recommend shampoo and conditioner probably twice a week. This allows your natural oils to work up. Make sure you brush/comb it though so those natural oils can be spread over the shaft to help keep it healthy. Try to avoid going out with it wet especially in this dry, cold time of year (assuming you're in the Northern Hemisphere). A quick way to get rid of stuff is actually to get an electric trimmer with foil shaver on it. It'll take things super short pretty quick which can be good in a dorm environment where speed is the name of the game.
I had it happen to me and my doctors said they have it happen pretty often at the beginning and that it would go away. For me it's gone away except for pretty rare occasions. While prolactinomas can cause this issue, I think it's a more common occurance and can occur without a prolactinoma. Would be worth calling your doc and asking them. However, you're not the first girl to experience this. I wouldn't freak out. Just call your doc and see if they'd like to see you.
One of the greatest senses of my dysphoria came from *lack* of social support and feeling innately like the social groups I was in, interacting with me as if I was male, felt so *wrong.*
Honestly, before I got Xbox Live, I needed a gamertag for some sort of Halo thing I was doing and the random name generator came up with it, and I really liked it! So when I was making a reddit account it was unique and I grabbed it :)
Stover’s nivelization is just... it’s a triumph of writing. People have told me how it’s not the best to write in his style but I don’t fucking care about the convention or breaking English rules. It reads so organically and true and feels like it truly captures *emotion* in a way so few Star Wars writers have been able to do.
Yeah but now they will need a rematch sometime between now and 2020.
***GRRRRRRRRRR***
I didn’t expect to be tearing up at 12:04 A.M. but here I am... 💖
Oh now that’s good. That’s very very good.
He’s lost some speed. His kind is sharper and more honed than ever. Brilliant mind for defense. He’s just a step slow. Time catches all of us. Even the legends. I can’t wait for hm to return and get a standing ovation from Chiefs Kingdom.
Document document document time, dates, and what is said. Then report to HR.
No problems with hrt + laser for me.
Holy shit Contra just mentioned this encounter in her live stream!!
Probably, but seeing as my orgasms are in this weird nebulous place between male and female, long and drown out and with some wave like sensations but also centered in my groin, they are pretty dysphoria inducing and the idea of waking up and just having what I am supposed to have sounds like fucking heaven to be honest...
