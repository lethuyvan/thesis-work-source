**Clank!** is far from a perfect game, but it's a lot of fun, especially if you're just starting out.

It was the game that actually got me into board games.
I am getting **Gloomhaven** to the table tonight, even if I have to play it by myself.
In no particular order:

* **Azul**
* **Skull**
* **Chinatown**
* **Clank!**
* **Viticulture + Tuscany**
**Tigris & Euphrates**, **Samurai**, **Concordia**, **Puerto Rico** and **Food Chain Magnate** are all in my Top 10 and are all very much "heads up".
Hello, my name is u/TheBaze. I'm 27 years old, or I would be if I was alive. Send this message to everyone you know or I will be meeting you tonight with my broken rope.
I totally get it. I'm a firm believer that there are no games too complex for someone who actually wants to learn and play them.
I mean, I do like the game and I *love* the concept, it's just not as good as other options.
I think I'm more afraid of that happenong than the opposite.

There's no way we'll be able to get a decent schedule for playing Gloomhaven, with all the other stuff available.
* **Chinatown** - do you have any idea how hard it was to get this?
* **Fog of Love** - it's just ridiculously unique and beautiful.
* **Inis** - it was the first "big" board game I got, and I love it.
* **Tigris & Euphrates** - my favorite game.
* **Tales of the Arabian Nights** - this is a funny one. I've only played it once, and it wasn't really that great an experience (we played it with 5 people), but I love the concept, I love the art and for some reason this game is the one that popped into my head when I started writing this list.
**Welcome to the Dungeon** - I love bluffing games, but the theme + the slightly more complex mechanics on this one makes it hard to get it to the table with non-gamers, and if I'm with gamers I'll play something more complex.

I don't see myself getting it out when I could just play **Skull** instead.
If you're interested in **Mage Knight**, you should probably try it before you buy it, but there's no need to be scared of it.

I've played it only 3 times so far, but while I do have to check the manual sometimes (mostly for the different status from some monsters), I've got the flow of the game down.
I think **Clank!** is a good introduction to deck building, and I love the idea of going into a dungeon and running from a dragon, but it's far from a perfect game.

It is, however, the game that actually got me into board games, so I'll always have a soft spot for it.
I got Gloomhaven with the promise of having people to play with me, but I'm still pretty sure I'll do most of it solo. 
Yes. The backs of the tiles are different.
My go-to answer to this question was always **Coup**, but since I've played it with the expansion I'm actually feeling a lot better about it.
Don't get me wrong, I love the game. 

I just think it's a bit too much to put on the table unless everyone knows what's happening and is ready for it.
My collection, while not huge, is pretty diverse. My most owned designer is **Reiner Knizia**, with 3 games.

Second are **Uwe Rosenberg**, **Vlaada Chvatil**, **Mac Gerdts** and **Bruno Cathala**, with 2 each. 
Playing Descent almost made me gave up on ever trying Mage Knight (which would have been a gigantic mistake).
Getting someone to play TI4 as their 7th game ever seems to me like a sure way to push them off for good.

I get that it's not really a hard game, but it can be traumatic experience if people don't know what they are getting into.
Since we're assuming the person is genuinely interested in the hobby, I feel like it would be best to introduce them to the many different mechanics available. Still, since they're completely new, I also think that theme is really important to keep them interested.

1. **Clank!** - While not a traditional gateway, Clank! was the game that got me hooked into the hobby. I feel like it's simple and thematic, while also showcasing some interesting mechanics.
2. **Viticulture + Tuscany** - No introduction to board games could be without a worker placement game, and while Viticulture is far from my favorite, I think it's a great way to show different, interesting themes, while also bringing some engine building to the table.
3. **Inis** - I wanted to get an area control game on the list, and the obvious choice was **El Grande**, but **Inis** has a better theme and card drafting, which is another mechanic I had to put on the list.
4. **Burgle Bros** - We needed a coop game, and Burgle Bros is by far my favorite. It's tight, strategic and incredibly thematic.
5. **Skull** - On the fifth day, it might be good to get something lighter on the table. If this was a random person, Skull would probably be the first game on the list, but if it's someone who wants to get into the hobby, I think it'd be best to wait and use it as a breather. Skull is my preferred entry into social games and bluffing.
6. **Chinatown** - In a similar thinking to Skull, above, I thought it'd be interesting to place Chinatown near the end. It's the game that comes as close to pure negotiation as possible, and after showcasing all those new, interesting mechanics, it's time to play one that rides entirely on the players and is limited only by their creativity.
7. **Tigris & Euphrates** - It took me a while to decide on what should crown this introduction to board games, but I couldn't go with anything other than T&E. It's my favorite game, and I think it's a good way to end the week in a challenge that arises not from complex mechanics, but from clever design, as the player is introduced to tile-placement in an ever-changing board, as people take their turns and place everything in disarray.

***

This was even harder than I expected, and some games unfortunately missed the cut, such as **Ticket to Ride**,  **Azul**, **7 Wonders**, **Puerto Rico**, **Concordia** and **Modern Art**.

I also feel like some crucial things are missing. There is no auction games and no abstracts, just name a few, but there's only so much you can do with only 7 games, and I would have loved to start out my gaming life withe these 7.
It guarantees there will be an equal amount of KD and QD tiles in game and it helps you to plan ahead for what's coming next (as in, depending on what you're going for, it might be worth it to take a "worse" tile in order to get to choose the next one.
I'm not sure. I've always played a friend's copy. If I had to guess, I'd say that you can, but you'll have to remove the insert.
You actually keep both sets separate and take the tiles from alternating piles each turn.
I feel like when you combine them you get a better ratio of "normal" tiles to the "special" queendomino tiles.

I also prefer to play it in a 7x7 grid than in a 5x5.
My main issue with **Queendomino** is that the arrival of the new tiles, with the buildings and knights and towers kind of watered down the "domino" part of the game, which was my favorite thing about **Kingdomino**.

However, there's a variant in the manual that uses all the tiles from both games to make 7x7 grids, so you actually get the full Kingdomino experience, upgraded by the Queendomino mechanics, instead of having it bogged down by the new stuff.
* **Through the Desert**
* **Schotten Totten**
* **Whistle Stop**
* **Millennium Blades**
* **Vinhos**
Honestly, I'd only get **Queendomino** if you already own **Kingdomino**. By itself, **Queendomino** is fine, but not really great, but it really shines when you play the two together.
If it's a pure review, I'd rather have it as text, with images.

If there's an aspect of entertainment to it (and SUSD is the obvious example), I'd rather have a video.
I like trying *everything*. 

I love clever, heavy games (Vital Lacerda is probably my favorite designer), but I also like stupid, crazy party games (just played **Halli Galli** last weekend and loved it). 
I've played *a lot* of **Illuminati** growing up, but while it will always have a special place in my heart (and in my shelves), I don't really see myself playing it anytime soon.
That wasn't my impression. The game is still pretty tight, and every action must be well thought. You just have more control over your game.

I mean, they include new dice but also new actions to take - it all works perfectly in the end.
Yeah, but the expansion also adds other stuff, so it's all well balanced. It's not just throwing a bunch of new dice in the game.
I mean, I'd definitely still play the base game if the expansion isn't available, but I don't see myself ever choosing it over playing with **Ladies**.

The main thing, to me, is the purple die (which can't be purchased from anyone else). It gives everyone much more control, since it guarantees you'll have at least one die, which you can use for any action, that will stay with you.
Ladies of Troyes for **Troyes**.
I really, really like **Twilight Struggle**, but never play it because it's so intense I get tired just thinking about it. 

I might actually need to be on vacation before getting it to the table again.
I'm getting together with some friends to play stuff, and I'm going to try and convince them to play it. Not sure how good it is solo.
The **Lost Legion** expansion for **Mage Knight** just might arrive tomorrow, so I'm hoping I can get at least one play of it.

I'd also like to get another play of **Burgle Bros** in.
Just because you can't add and subtract doesn't mean the game is poorly designed.
It happened to me before.

My character was extremely charismatic, but also quite impatient with stupidity, and the other party member were a wizard who constantly fucked things up and a ranger who was like the guy in "Memento", and forgot everything he didn't write down.

He ended up getting so constantly pissed off that all his charismatic demeanor vanished after just a couple of sessions.
**Lisboa** is my current favorite, but it might be because it's the new one.

**The Gallerist** is right after it. 
A friend of mine had already shown me a few modern games before  (like **Catan** and **Eldritch Horror**), but neither really clicked with me. 

I only really got into board games after we went on a trip to the US last year and he took me to CSI.

I saw all the different games possibilities and my curiosity got the best of me. Later that day we played **Clank!** and I got officially hooked.
You can't go wrong with Vital Lacerda.
While I agree that initiative order is an underwhelming tiebreaker, something like most planets conquered, fleet or technology wouldn't really work due to the asymmetry between all races.
I've only played it once so far, but my first impressions is that Burgle Bros is nothing more than a puzzle game with a push-your-luck aspect to it.

You have just enough information to decide your course of action, and the mechanics give you some control over what happens from turn to turn, but will need to know when to take risks and when to be careful.

That being said, you'll never have complete control over it, and there are some points when you can get caught (and lose one of your stealth tokens, which are your lives) due to sheer bad luck.

As an example, whenever you first enter a floor, the guard will appear at a random room and move to another at the end of that turn. It might happen that you get caught as soon as you get up, if you're not careful enough to scout it out first (which is also not always possible).

If that feels like something you might enjoy, I definitely recommend it.
**Skull** - It was actually even better than I expected! I love bluffing games and we play **Cockroach Poker** a lot, but playing the exact same thing every time can get old. I've also tried **Welcome to the Dungeon**, but it didn't really click - it felt a little too complex for what I was looking for and for getting "non-gamers" to get over their prejudice and enjoy it.

My copy of **Burgle Bros** finally arrived - after almost a year, a package lost in transit and the damned brazilian customs - and we had to play it at once. It was just great. My brother isn't really a fan of coop games, but he really enjoyed it as well. I look forward to playing it again with more players and different characters.

My first play of **Orléans** keeps eluding me, however. We'll see if I get to play it this month (*narrator: he won't - Gloomhaven is arriving next week*).
I came back to elite only a few weeks ago, and found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/6jx3ag/ps4_commanders_madoucs_welcome_pack_fun_riches/) by u/Madouc that covered a bit of exploring on a sidewinder (though I actually did it on an eagle).

That not only gave me some idea on how exploring was, but also gave me enough credits to get my AspX and start outfitting. A few trips to nearby interesting places got me the money to finish it (although not engineered).

I also definitely recommend the SRV.
My balances have been negative for quite a few months now, and I finally decided to take action on it.

I did get a loan so I could get a lower interest rate, but I also coupled that with a decent financial plan and a realistic budget.

I can't explain how much better I feel now that I have a clear way out in sight.
I'm currently on my first trip to Sag*A and, TBH, most of exploration is pretty boring.

There are three things that really help to keep me going, though:

1. Netflix (or youtube, or podcasts, or whatever);
2. Having a clear objective; 
3. Every so often, you'll find something really, really cool.

The third one is by far the most important. I had been thinking about going exploring for a while, but what made me pull the trigger on it was visiting Betelgeuse. That ridiculous, gigantic ball of fire had me in such awe that I knew that exploration was for me. Finding something cool, especially when you're the first one to do so, makes it all worth it.
That was one of my concerns before getting it, but you can adjust the difficulty of each scenario depending on how many characters you're playing with and their levels.

The only issue would be to have people coming and going, playing only some of the scenarios, since they would miss some of the story. That being said, however, if they don't care about that, it could also work fine.
Got to play a bunch of new lighter games:

* **Skull** - I finally got to play Skull, and it is every bit as fun as I thought it would be. I was already a great fan of **Cockroach Poker**, but it is great to have another great bluffing game to play.

* **Imagine** - Imagine is a bit too simple for my tastes (and I love silly games). It was fun, but nothing I'd ever recommend. There are much better party games around.

* **HMS Dolores** - I had learned about HMS Dolores in one of the old SUSD videos, but never really gave it too much of a thought until a friend of mine got it. Boy, was I wrong to doubt it. It is a great little game about negotiation, bluffing and backstabbing. I definitely recommend it.

* **Qwirkle** - Looking at Qwirkle's box, you'd think this is one of those silly games for children that are too young to know better, like hungry hungry hippo, pop up pirate or something like that. But then you see the Spiel des Jahres seal on it and get intrigued, and if you decide to take a leap of faith on it, you'll find one of the most interesting abstract games I've ever played. I love the choices you make in it, while both trying to score as many points as possible without setting someone else up for even more points. 

* **NMBR 9** - Ever since I learned about NMBR 9, I knew I would love it, and I was right. It is not often that such a simple game will get me to play it solo, but NMBR 9 had me going at it again and again trying to up my highscore.

* **Dr. Eureka** - While I do love silly games, Dr. Eureka didn't really work for me. It might be because I'm awful at it and played with someone who was really good, which made it so I couldn't really appreciate it, but the game just felt like a silly version of **Dimension**.
My copy of **Gloomhaven** is arriving next week and I don't really think my group will want to play it on the long run, so I'm probably going to have them play it with me a few times (or once) and move on solo.
Currently at 8:

1. Cockroach Poker - 23 plays
2. Kingdomino - 18 plays
3. Onitama - 15 plays
4. Hive - 12 plays
5. The Game - 11 plays
6. NMBR 9 - 10 plays
7. Bohnanza - 9 plays
8. Galaxy Trucker - 8 plays

For 2018 it's sitting at 3:

1. NUMBR 9 - 10
2. Kingdomino - 5
3. Samurai - 4

Since I'm trying to do a 10x10 Challenge this year, it should get to at least 10.
TBH, that episode was never great. 
TBH, that episode was never great. 
Two. I don't really have the time to play too many games, so while I'm willing to give a game a second chance (especially if I had trouble "getting" it on my first try), I'm not going to spend my time playing something I didn't like.

We usually count everyone's scores out loud, and leave the ones we think are more likely to have won for last, so there's some anticipation over it.
IMHO, in a 6 players game, having to wait 10 turns to be able to do something again is never fun, no matter how rare that may be.
While I can agree that a trap or something could reasonably make you lose a turn to get out of it, it still really bothers me. Even more so because of the long period between your turns in many dungeon crawlers.

I'd much rather have something that makes you unable to move, for example, but still able to attack, use items, or anything else. 
I believe there are, and I would totally be willing to give it a shot with the expansions, but I only played the base game.
Don't have skip a turn mechanics. Seriously. Or even something similar to that. 

In **Charterstone**, if no one frees one of your amazing number of TWO workers, you have to spend a turn to get them back. I hate that so much.


That was the exact reason I didn't like **Arctic Scavengers**.
Those damn rats always get me instanely frustrated.
Idk, I feel like different traits, scenes and players should make up for the similar storylines. Despite what they say in the review, I'd be absolutely willing to play the same main storyline twice. 

I mean, most romantic comedies have pretty much the same story and people still watch them. 
1. Lisboa
2. The Gallerist
3. Mage Knight
4. Food Chain Magnate
5. Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition
I first heard about **Fog of Love** on one of SUSD's podcasts, and instantly knew it was for me. The hard part was getting people to play it.

So far, I've managed to do it twice, and had a great time in both of them, albeit having very different games: once with my brother, in which the relationship crashed and burned when both of us went for the "Dominating" destiny; and once with a friend of mine, in which we were so in sync we actually managed to pull of the winning condition for the "Equal Partners" destiny on the very last turn, in a scene that had both of us picking the perfect choice combination.

I absolutely love it, but it's not a game you can push on people. Both people have to really get into it so it work as it should, but when that happens, it's one of the best board game experiences they'll ever have.
I joke with my friends that Fog of Love is barely a game. The mechanics are definitely simple, and if you play it with the mindset of winning, you will probably be left disappointed.

I feel like Fog of Love is more of an experience. It doesn't rely on theme as much as it *is* the theme. You have to really get into it and see the scenes as actual scenes, and not just ways to get points in one of the aspects, to fully enjoy it. I've only played it twice so far, but I had some great experiences with it on both times. 

It is definitely not a game for everyone, and that's completely fine.
They mean having people spectating, which is actually really interesting. 

I've played it with a friend of mine and about 15 minutes into the game her boyfriend decided to watch - he seemed to enjoy it and I thought it was great to have someone to talk to about this made-up relationship we were playing.
I'm torn between getting it because of Vital and not getting it because my group will never want to play it.
If you use the power guard it should be fine. I do it regularly with Guard 3, no Guard Up (though I do take some damage).
This pisses me off way more than it should.
Wow.
I've been guilty of this before. Some things really frustrate me no matter how well I'm doing.
I prefer Kingdomino for what it is, but the variant using both games was also a lot o fun. Not sure about needing it, though.
I main HBG and use the Bazel's HH when I want something different. It's just amazing. 

I also decided to try out lance and had a blast poking Diablos to death.
Alright, I got to play some amazing things.

These were technically last week, but screw it. I do what I want:

* **Twilight Imperial: Fourth Edition** (6p, 1x) - This was my second play of TI4, and it was even better than the first time, even if I failed miserably at it. Overall, TI is quite an interesting game. You spend almost 10 hours around the table playing a single game, and it mostly flies by. The only time it kind of drags on is by the end, when you have some people who are clearly ahead (or clearly out of the run). It is all worth it in the end, though, and I am more than willing to make it a monthly game.

* **Charterstone** (5p, 1x) - This was our third play of Charterstone, the first with an automa (we started with 6 people, but one of us won't be able to play anymore). I have quite a few issues with it, the main one being downtime - if you want to follow a different strategy from the others, you might end up losing one third of your plays to get your workers back. Even aside from that, though, it just felt like an average game. I don't see us playing it 12 times if not for the legacy aspect of it. Right now I'm just going along with it because I'm curious about it and want the full experience.

Now for the new ones:

* **Mombasa** (3p, 1x) - I got to play Mombasa for the second time, and while it was a lot more enjoyable (now that I actually understood what I was doing), it still did not charm me. I can easily say that it's an excellent game, that I had a lot of fun playing it and that I'm more than willing to play it again, but I don't see myself ever asking for it.

* **Queendomino** (3p, 2x) - We played Queendomino for the first time this week. The first time, we played it with the base rules, and despite its apparent similatirites to **Kingdomino**, it felt like a *very* different game. It's not even close. And for the time it takes to play Queendomino, I'd rather play something else. On the second time we played it, however, we did with the variant that uses both the Kingdomino and Queendomino tiles, which I felt made it a lot better (albeit also even longer). The inclusion of the Kingdomino tiles brings the game closer to the original, with the common tiles reinforcing the tile laying aspect of the game, which is what I loved in the first place.

* **Samurai** (3p, 2x) - Leaving the best for last. **Tigris and Euphrates** is my undisputed favorite game ever, and Samurai scratches a very similar itch, while being different enough to make me feel like it's very worth to own both. We played it twice this last weekend, and it was simply amazing. It's even simpler than T&E, but it still has that tightness and tense decision making that makes it so great. Add to that the playing time of about half an hour, and Samurai has skyrocketed to be placed among my favorite games. It also made me feel like I have to get **Through the Desert** and complete my collection. 

Be thorough. Don't assume your audience is stupid, but also don't assume they will simply get all you have on your head without you saying it.

My main issue with explaining is that I rush past things that seem obvious to me, and this often results in people not understanding the concept perfectly or just getting it flat out wrong.
I did just switch to dober. I care way more about looks than utility. 
Not quite the same thing, but there's one friend I won't play any negotiation games with because he won't ever trade without getting a significant advantage from it (as in, he won't do it even if it's good for both parties involved, but will act like you're trying to con him instead). 

**Chinatown** is one of my favorite games ever, and playing it with him was one of the worst experiences I ever had while gaming.
I have only played it once, but I had a really bad experience due to not being able to get medicine from the junkyard (and there was no consistent way of getting it with the open cards), which severely restricted my capability of buying the best cards.

It seems like the expension solves that issue, so if you want to get it, I'd go with that.


I get that (it's kind of the point of the game), what I mean is that with a gun you barely need any preparation at all.

Just go in there and pierce through that silly wind.
It really depends on what weapon you're using. Kushala as a gunner was probably the easiest elder so far.
My greatest issue with Teostra is how he just switches targets and jumps at you in like a second. 

If you're just a bit too slow to react, you'll take that jump attack and, if you're stupid like me and think making all the weapons in the game is more important than getting out of that damn bone armor, you'll be looking at death in the eyes.
/r/jesuschristreddit
GET ALL THE COWS. It works for **Agricola**, **Caverna** and, most importantly, **Great Western Trail**.
Only if you want to do the same action over and over again.
CAH. While Joking Hazard's visual aspects allow for some amazing jokes, more often than not they stop you from playing something due to your card having the wrong character speaking at the time.
I like Patchwork a more, but Barenpark is also great and plays with more people.
**El Grande** is the best pure Area Control game I've ever played, but I prefer **Inis** overall.

It depends on what you're going for.
I have yet to play Pandemic Legacy, but I'm 3 plays into Charterstone  and have found it to be not that great. There's no way I would play it 12 times if not for the legacy aspect of it.

It really bothers me that I need someone to displace one of my workers in order to be able to have more than 2 actions before having to basically discard my turn to get them back (effectively making me play only 1/3 of my turns), and even if the minions do somewhat mitigate this, they still depend on having available spots on your charter, and they only got into our game on our last play.

TBH, rather than keeping the game fresh and unique, I'm still waiting for the gameplay and mechanics to evolve enough to make it worth playing over something else.
GWT is a puzzle in optimization. TfM just feels like playing a huge number of cards. 
While I feel like **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** solves the one issue I have with **Suburbia** (the randomness from the price setting of the tiles), I find it lacking in other areas that make it so **Suburbia** remains the better game.

**Mad King Ludwig** just seems like it ends too soon. At most, you manage to build one wing of the castle, while in **Suburbia** you actually feel like you're building a city. The interaction between tiles also works much better in **Suburbia**.


**Cockroach Poker**, followed closely by **Kingdomino**.
Honestly, I don't think **Agricola** and **Viticulture** actually compete for playing time. 

Even though both are worker placement games, **Viticulture** is a lighthearted experience, boosted by its great theme and amazing looks, while **Agricola** involves tension, suffering and starvation.

The reason I don't play much **Viticulture** is due to games like **Village**, that are other lighter worker placement games that I feel bring something more interesting to the table.
I can live with that. I'm too used to being able to just fire away with no worries and end up being too careless at melee.
So you're saying I'll have to resign myself to not always get those pretty orange numbers?
As a gunner trying HH, it's just so hard to get used to being right next to the monster all the time.

Also, how about those pesky monsters who keep their heads our of reach? Even Anjanath was a pain to kill, let alone some of those flying things.
I just got a couple of guard mods on my HBG and after blocking Nergigante's flying bullshit I really want to try playing lance.
**Sheriff of Nottingham** really shines when people are willing to roleplay. If not, you'd do much better playing something like **Cockroach Poker**.
> and I did it the Hunter way, by murdering an overgrown mudskipper and using parts of his corpse to destroy a jalapeno T-Rex.

I'm dying here.

Also, good job, hunter! Keep up the good work and in no time you'll be able see Anjanath and not run in terror^atleastIhope.
Oh, I know. 

A couple of days ago I was playing with a friend with a CB and immediately regretted my decision when I started to charge my wyvern shot at a downed monster.

On the same day (and with the same friend) I dropped a couple of cluster shots in a similar situation...

I think I actually felt worse for how little he seemed to mind.
I've been using a HBG teamed only with a Bow user for a while now, so I sometimes forget that knocking people around is a thing. I'm really, really sorry about that.
I'm not even sure I'll use the Legi HBG at all, I just made it because it looks cool.
LETS FUCKING GO
LET'S GO!
I'm still using my bone helm just because it looks cool.
I always try to play with at least one ranged and one melee weapon.

As a HBG main since my first MH game, I always forced myself to have a melee weapon that could cut tails. 

Now, with the new slicing shot, I can finally indulge myself on the glory of the Hunting Horn.
HBG has been my favorite weapon in every MH game I've played. I always try some different stuff and always go back to it.
The game looks really bland and the board ends up not being really clear - every single game I've played of it had someone confusing the provinces.
**Viticulture** is nice - I really like how it looks, I love the theme and think it's a pretty interesting game overall, but it's far from my favorite worker placement game.

**Concordia**, on the other hand, has a generic theme and is hideous, but it's an *amazing* game. Every single action has layers to it, which is incredible for such a clean game. It's one of my top 10 favorite games, and I don't know anything quite like it.

I'd say you should go for Viticulture only if (i) you're looking for a worker placement game; (ii) you really care about theme; and (iii) you mind how bad concordia looks.

Other than that, I'd get **Concordia** every time.
My schedule is also pretty erratic, but I'm definitely intersted!
My friends and I like to say that playing games about dragons or aliens isn't really nerdy.

What's nerdy is playing a game about trying not to starve on the middle ages in **Agricola**, managing a colony in **Puerto Rico**, living and dying in a **Village** or just growing trees in **Photosynthesis**.
Kind of. 

I don't really bother about highscores, but I keep track of all games I play, with everyone's scores, so it's there if I ever want to check it.
I never play **Mysterium** (partly because my group hates it), but I'm having a real hard time putting it for sale because it just looks amazing.
**How old are you?** 26.

**Are you available on weekdays around 8pm?** Aside from thursdays, I'm usually available on weekdays, barring any emergencies from work.

**Are you ok with risque humor? We make fun of everything.** Oh, yes.

**Are you fine with building a story in a group setting?** Definitely.

**How would you react if a player does something you don't like?** I'd try to talk it out.

**How would you react if the DM does something you don't like?** I'd accept it - the DM has final say on everything -, but I'd definitely voice my concerns. I'm a firm believer that a game gets better with communication. 

**How many push ups can you do?** About 5.

**What books/movies/games are you into?** I like pretty much everything, but I read mostly Sci-fy and fantasy and play games that provide interesting experiences or good narratives - I love playing RPGs, but find that most of them stick too much to the same formula - give me a different, innovative setting and interesting characters and I'll play that game for ages.  

**Tell me a fun fact about yourself?** ~~I like to take long walks on the beach~~ I like to argue pointlessly about the how's and why's of impossible, hypothetical stuff.

**You see girl crying in the middle of a forest. Upon coming closer you see that all the plant life around her is wilted and dying. What do you do?** I throw some more plants near her to see what happens before getting any closer.

**You see an unstable portal in front of you, with a sign that says do not touch. What do you do?** I try to find out more about it. If I can't find anything, I throw things at it to see what happens (*I'm sensing a pattern here...*).

**What kind of DnD characters do you like to play? Ya Ya, "you'll play w/e" That's not the question. I want to know what YOU like to play.** I like to try doing different stuff with my characters. At the start of the game I'll think about how I want the character to be, from his backstory and all, and then I'll try to roleplay tham as well as I can, along with any changes that feel natural with the story.

For example, I recently played an arrogant and short-fused bard that ended up being quite unlikable, despite his high charisma, due to being completely unable to control his temper (I didn't really count on my party being made up of one of the stupidest wizards ever to be unintentionally played in the history of D&D). He was ridicusously overconfident, absolutely useless and I loved him.


**Tales of the Arabian Nights** does have a board - the book is just where you'll find the story parts. I definitely second that recommendation.

It might be somewhat different from what you're looking for, but you should also check out **Fog of Love**. It's an amazing game about roleplaying a relationship and is one of the most interesting games I've ever played. The only possible drawback is that it's for 2 players only.
I don't know, while you definitely can (and probably should) math out the last turn, I always felt the beauty of the game was always a bit on the gambling aspect of not knowing what's gonna get out of that bag.
I want **Gloomhaven** so bad, but it's pretty much impossible for me to import it at an acceptable price. Shipping alone would double the cost, not to mention all the ensuing taxes...
Oh, to be perfectly clear: it's absolutely super silly, and I don't think any stable relationship would actually be impacted by this game. 
Just from the events and developments from the game. You get so invested in the characters that you *really* care about how things go.

Considering it's a game about relationships, with with some pretty life-like scenes, I could definitely see some real-life arguments arising.
*"I buy what I want."*
One of the guys in my gaming group hates negotiation games, so I've only managed to get it to the table once so far.
I've only played the tutorial so far, but it was really great. 

Still, be aware that playing this with your wife might be a risky move.
Came here to mention these two.
[SUSD's review of Tigris and Euphrates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jl_ensO_UY), by far.
I think it depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for the best bluffing experience, I think you might prefer something like **Skull** or **Cockroach Poker**.

Where **Sheriff of Nottingham** really shines, IMO, is on the roleplaying of the interaction between sheriff and merchant. That's what makes it really funny and really, really good.
In my case, it's actually pretty hard to get a regular group going, due to conflicting schedules and all.

One thing I love about boardgaming is that, aside from legacy games, there's no need to have the whole group together at all times.
I have to ask: why not D&D?
> here is the infamous 20,000 word review on Tigris and Euphrates, and if this doesn't make you want to play it, nothing will.

Wow. 
Probably **Chinatown**.
I want it so bad just because Discworld. It's a shame it doesn't seem to be nearly good enough to be worth the price.
**Tigris & Euphrates**, definitely.
**Bohnanza**, **Cockroach Poker**, **The Game**.
I'd go with Five Tribes, myself.
Not too much this week:

* **Cockroach Poker** (7p, 2x) - Played twice and didn't lose any of them! I just might be getting better at this.

* **Codenames** (7p, 4x) - I was so out of sync with the rest of my team that it's a miracle we managed to win all the matches. Luckily the other 2 people on our team were a couple, and they managed to understand each other.

* **Bärenpark** (4p, 1x) - I won at Bärenpark! And it was our group's highest score ever! And I usually suck at this game! I'm excited!

* **Mysterium** (7p, 1x) - I'm not really sure how I feel about Mysterium. I actually like the game, but I'm not really sure why. I love the idea behind it, but its mechanics seem way too clunky (the whole voting thing seems to make the game overly complicated for no good reason, and putting the whole game behind a single decision by the end makes it so that we might do very well and still lose at the end for no reason). I think it can still work with the right group of people, but there must be something wrong with a "gateway" that makes me feel tired just by thinking of it.

***

* We usually just get into a consensus over what to play, and so far there hasn't been any issues. We usually just won't play a game someone doesn't want to, and wait to play it another time. 
**Catacombs Conquest** and **Root**.
A newt?
I understand the appeal of the game, it's just not for me.

I once I failed so many times in a row I started to repeat encounter cards. That was the day I decided I would never play it again.
OOh, I got to play a bunch of new stuff this month:

* **Tides of Time** - I liked it well enough, but it didn't really blow my mind. I'd play it again, but it's not a game I plan to get for myself.

* **Photosynthesis** - Photosynthesis was my great surprise of the month. When I first saw it I thought it looked *gorgeous*, but I never expected to actually like the gameplay that much. The sun and shade mechanics is just brilliant, and it has become one of my gaming group's most requested games. While you might have some optimal moves at the start of the game, you spend most of the time reacting to what other people are doing, which has made it stay fresh so far. 

* **Glüx** - I'm a big fan of abstract games, and Glüx has all the makings to be among the best. It's simple, it's clever and it's deep. I love it and can see myself playing it for a long time.

* **7 Wonders Duel** - While I do like the original **7 Wonders**, 7 Wonders Duel blew me away. It has all the good parts of 7 Wonders with a card selecting mechanic that is much more interesting than just drafting. I like it a lot, and plan to get it for myself soon.

* **Mombasa** - I've only played Mombasa once so far, and while I had absolutely no idea of what I was doing for most of the game, I thought it was pretty interesting. I definitely want to play it again.

* **Mage Knight** - I only got into the hobby earlier this year, but ever since I did, I have heard about Mage Knight and got incredibly interested in it. I got really close to getting it a million times, but always backed off, because it was hard to justify the cost without trying it out first (especially because it is labeled as a dungeon crawler, and I really didn't like **Descent**). Well, this month I finally got to try it and I *love* it. I actually thought it was much easier than people made it seem, and I had a lot of fun with it. I'm definitely getting it soon, and I believe it will fill me need for solo gaming for many years to come.
I absolutely hate **Eldritch Horror**. I hate how long it takes, I hate that you can just get stuck forever at one place trying to get a stupid clue just because of bad dice rolls and I want to kill the one responsible for the "delayed" mechanic.

I don't hate **Terraforming Mars**, but I'm kind of lukewarm about it. It's not awful, but I don't love it, either. I'll play it if people want to (which is way more than I'd like, since my group really likes it), but I'll never suggest it.
But when you add in the draft the game takes about twice as long as it would be reasonable to expect. 
I went there for 11 days, too, and it wasn't even close to enough. 
Wow, any chance you got the dimensions for the boxes and trays?

I've been smashing my head against the wall thinking of the best way to do an insert for SidCon, to no avail.
I agree. While I love **Agricola**, I didn't really like **Caverna** all that much. 

Part of what I love about **Agricola** is the constant struggle, as you try to do your best with what cards you're dealt (both literally and metaphorically). **Caverna**, on the other hand, felt too loose - instead of finding what you had to do to survive, you must decide what to do to make the most points.

In **Agricola**, you actually feel the tension and the struggle, but **Caverna** just seems like another puzzle to be solved.
Alright, here it goes:

* **The Game** (2x, 4p) - there's an insane amount of laughter and yelling inside that tiny box, while also being quite clever. I love it;

* **Cockroach Poker** (3x, 4p) - our favorite game for playing drunk;

* **Splendor** (1x, 4p) - I won at my second time playing Splendor! Went the opposite way from the first time I played: went big after the high scoring cards, instead of trying to build up with cheap ones and won without any noblemen. 

* **Tigris and Euphrates** (1x, 4p) - This was a crazy game of T&E, with me winning all the first 5 or 6 conflicts from drawing the perfect tiles at the perfect time. At the end of the day, however, I won because the other players let me consistently get points uncontested while they fought it out. 

* **Photosynthesis** (1x, 4p) - I've seen quite a few complaints about this game on this sub, but I really like it. My single issue with it is how it seems like starting badly can seriously impair how well you do at the game, but I still want to play it some more before stating that clearly. 

* **Terra** (1x, 4p) - Terra is an interesting game. I find it hard to understand how I can like a game so much while also being made to feel so incredibly stupid. It's really, really funny.

* **Mombasa** (1x, 4p) - My first time playing Mombasa was intense. I had absolutely no idea of what I was doing, and ended up 60 points behind the first player (and 30 behind the 3rd). Still, I want to try it again, now that I have some idea of what I'm supposed to do.

***

* Poll: I see the game the social aspect as equally important. Playing with friends is just as important as playing at all, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

* "*How have you met your gaming group?*" - This friend of mine has been into the hobby for a while now, and when I ~got~ was dragged in I ended up meeting more and more with the people from his group, until I got officially invited in.
Boardgaming. I got into the hobby in April this year, and have purchased around 30 and played over 70 different games over the last 8 months.

I just can't get enough.
Yes for Stone Age. Don't know about the others.
I'd search for the couple of people who really matter to me and then stay the hell away from law school. 
That is true.
You are a boring botanist, though.
Fair enough. We had it on the table for every single meeting of our gaming group since one of us got it, and we all really like it. Different tastes for different people, I guess.
I absolutely loved **Photosynthesis**. I feel like unless you actually master the game (as in, actually learn the very perfect move for every given situation), the different ways other people play should be enough to make it replayable. 
**A Wizard of Earthsea, by Ursulla Le Guin**.

I've just finished **Lies of Locke Lamora, by Scott Lynch** last night and immediately jumped into A Wizard of Earthsea. I'm only a few chapters in, but I really like the writing style and the world building so far. The way things are going, I'm most likely finishing it in the next few days.
Good mix of old and new this week:

* **Stone Age** (4p, 1x) - Not much to be said about Stone Age. I feel like it's the perfect ligh worker placement game (you're not always up for a game of **Agricola**, as great as it is). This last time, I got really close to winning, but messed up by going for a new worker on the second to last turn, which may have cost the 6 points I needed to win - oh, well, at least I'm getting better at it.

* **Glüx** (3p, 1x) - I still feel like Glüx works best with even numbers, but playing with 3 was better than I expected. I also won, so that's a plus!

* **Terraforming Mars** (5p, 1x) - This was my second time playing the game, and I'm still not a big fan of it. It's ok - I wouldn't flat out refuse playing it again -, but  I don't see me ever suggesting playing it, either. 

* **7 Wonders Duel** (2p, 1x) - Got to try 7 Wonders Duel this week, and I actually really like it, even more than the original. I like **7 Wonders**, but I feel like 7 Wonders Duel makes thing more strategic - at any point, you have to realise that getting the card you want will open another card your opponent might want, without anything you could do to stop it. I like how the military track works, I like how science works - it's a great game all around that I just might pick up for myself.

* **Mage Knight** (2p, 1x) - leaving the best for last: I finally got to play Mage Knight! After months looking at it and seriously considering purchasing without having ever given it a go, I had a chance to try it this weekend and I absolutely loved it. It's not a simple game by any chance, but I actually felt like it's difficulty was blown way out of proportion. It surely helped that I had someone who knew the game to teach it to me, but after we were done with that, things seemed to make sense. I'm definitely getting this one soon.
Ok, I'm by no means an expert at this. I lose more than I win (to be exact: I've won 36% of the games I've played since I started tracking my plays). That being said, I don't care so much about winning than I care about understanding what is happening and why I won or why I lost. 

I don't really think there's a right answer, here, but here's what I'm thinking: I've read some of your answers in other comments and got this idea that you usually head for a strategy and just stick to it throughout the game.

I feel like it's important to have more flexibility on your games. Try not to focus so much on what you're doing, and instead observe the board and your opponents. What is everyone else doing? You don't need to track everyone's strategy exactly, just get a general idea of it. If there's a bunch of people competing for what you're trying to do, you might be better off trying somehting else.

Try to think a bit more short-term and react to the board. Don't get too much into what you're doing that you're not able to react to things changing on the board.

Look at the mechanics and think about how and why things work the way they work. Remember that your objective is to make the most points possible, and not just get an engine going.
I'm finally playing **Mage Knight** this weekend!

...and I'll also try to get **Sideral Confluence** to the table, as I do every single week, but so far we've only played it once.
**Catacombs Conquest**, **Root**, **CO2: Second Chance**, **Escape Plan** and maybe, just maybe, **Gloomhaven**.
'07 was the first Super Bowl I ever watched, so while I did get upset, it wasn't until I got really into football that it started to really bother me.

'11 just crushed me. 
It pisses me off that the Jets manage to suck year after year and still give the Pats a hard time.
Well, I don't know if it would help, but to keep it in perspective: I live in Brazil and I still stop every couple of weeks to consider buying Chinatown (which would cost USD 100 + about USD 40 for shipping + about USD 80 for import taxes).

Granted, I always give up because it would be over USD 200 for it, but I still consider it. 

If I get a chance to travel to the US soon, I'll definitely get Chinatown - I'm absolutely sure it is worth 100 dollars (to me, at least).

That's how much I like this game.
I had listened to some of their stuff before, but never this. Thank you for reminding me of them.

I just found out they're doing a show here next month and immediately got my tickets.
Expanding on this. On every round, everyone will draw new tiles and new lots at random, so you can't really know what will happen. Completing a store makes a lot of difference, and if you don't draw what you need, you'll have to trade it with someone else.

That being the case, while you can think of probabilities, you can't really know how things will turn out until the last turn, and *even then* you'll only have an estimate who's really winning, since the money is hidden anyway, so while you can math out the value of the trades, that doesn't mean you can't still make trades that are lucrative to both parties, in which case you'll have to guess/hope/estimate that the trade you're making will place you ahead of your friends.

I'd play **Chinatown** a million times if I could. 

That being said, since you said you have already played **Sidereal Confluence**, I'll second the recommendation for **Bohnanza** - it's simple, quick and random enough to reduce your worries on the mathing out thing.
I've only played it with 4, and it worked fine, but it seemed that it would really shine with more (I doubt I'll be able to do it anytime soon, but I'd really like to give a 9-player game a try).
Didn't play much last week, but what I did play was great. I also won everything, which was nice, for a change.

* **Glüx** (4p, 1x) - I'm a big fan of abstract games, and a friend of mine has been telling me about Glux for a while, so when he finally got the game, we immediately got it to the table, and it did not disappoint. Like all great abstracts, it's really simple, while also being amazingly clever. 

* **Photosynthesis** (4p, 1x) - Ok, so here's the deal with Photosynthesis. When I first saw it, I thought it seemed really cool, with it having such an unique theme and with all those little trees on the table. I never expected it to be nearly as good as it is. It is an *amazing* area control game, and the mechanic of having the sun rotating around the board and casting shadows is just brilliant. I really, really liked it.

* **Troyes** (4p, 1x) - The first time I played Troyes, I was so overwhelmed that I ended up not being able to enjoy the game above all the frustration. What really bothered me is that, from all I knew about the game, I was sure I would like it. A friend of mine, who really loves the game, had just purchased the **Ladies of Troyes** expansion, so I decided to give the game another try. I'm not sure if it was the expansion or if it was just because the game finally started to click for me, but this time I had a great time with it. 

***

No conventions yet, unfortunately. 
It's a game by an unknown designer, it's not flashy and looks way more complicated than it actually is. 

Only reason I got it is because I saw it being called "Chinatown on crack", and Chinatown is one of my 2 favorite board games ever.

That being said, I only played SidCon once, and while I did really like it, I'm not yet sure if it can replace Chinatown for me. SidCon is not really a game you can just put on the table with anyone, unless you want to scare people off.
This has been a *really* slow year for my reading, so I've only got 6 squares down so far (and that's only if **On Writing, by Stephen King** counts for fantasy related non-fiction).

I decided to check on the bingo today and I am really glad it only ends in March, otherwise there was no chance I could do it in time.
They're different games. 

At the end of the day, they're both negotiation games, in which you're just trading to get more stuff at the end of a certain number of turns, but while **Chinatown** is just pure trading and negotiating, **Sidereal Confluence** has more stuff going on, with the different races, the slightly different way each economy works (due to the slightly different converters) and the fact you use different resources, instead of just money.

The result is that the game isn't really that intuitive - I have played **Chinatown** a lot, but still got a bit stuck with the possible trades from SidCon. It took a while before it clicked.

As for player count, I played SidCon with 4, and while I really liked it, I felt like it would be better with more people, due to the larger variety of trades and the overall boost in the game's economy.
We only played it once so far, but I don't think it has ever happened before that I ended a 4 player game thinking about how it could be better with 6 or even more players.
**Sidereal Confluence** - We finally did it! It was way more complex than I expected, and I think we'll have to play a couple more times before it really clicks for everyone.
Got to play some old and new this weekend:

* **Puerto Rico** (4p, 1x) - I play Puerto Rico way too little, considering how much I like it. This week we managed to get a play in and it was just as good as always, and I lost just like always. Great game.

* **The Gallerist** (4p, 1x) - I'm always amazed at how The Gallerist manages to be so deep, so complex, and at the same time feel so light. We finished the game after almost 2 hours of brain burning, and I would easily just play it again as soon as we were done. I'm now waiting for **Lisboa** to arrive, but if I like it half as much as I like this one, it will already deserve a place of honor on my shelf (which will be wherever I can fit that giant box).

* **Terra** (6p, 1x) - Ok, I suck at Terra. Bad. But it's still just a pile of fun. It's a trivia game in which you're not really showing yout knowledge as much as your ability of making smart bets on the possibly answers. Even for me, who am *awful* at trivia (my memory sucks for details, like dates and such - I know how and in which order things happened in history, but don't ask me the exact when), Terra allows you to see what others say and think and play the game based on people, rather than just having to know the answers.

* **Pandemic** (4p, 1x) - I finally got to play Pandemic! It never gets to the table with my group, since one of us *hates* cooperative games, so I never had a chance to try it until now. We lost, but I still had a lot of fun, and it made even more eager to try **Pandemic Legacy**.

***

* Poll Question: Competitive, definitely. I like coop, but there's nothing quite like matching your wits against your friends'.

* I haven't really played many games with creepy or scary themes, so I'd say probably **Bloodborne: The Card Game**, which, while fun, doesn't really have that much variety.
I've only played about 80 different games or so, so no.
Competitive

1. **Tigris & Euphrates**
2. **Chinatown**
3. **The Gallerist**

Cooperative:

1. **Magic Maze**
2. **The Game**
3. **Mysterium**
I got really confused by that.
Oh, I almost never win. It's still great.
* **Bärenpark** (3p, 1x) - After having finally played **Patchwork**, I can officially say that Patchwork is, IMO, the better game. However, there's quite a few 2 player games I'd play before it, and Bärenpark plays up to 4 people, so I think I'd still rather have that, even if I'm terrible at it.

* **Hive** (2p, 3x) - Hive is great. Seriously. Great.

* **Cockroach Poker** (6p, 1x) - Introduced my brother and a few friends to the wonders of Cockroach Poker and found out that being awful at this game might be a family thing. The plus side is that I didn't lose, for once.

* **Stone Age** (4p, 1x) - Another game I'm absolutely awful at, while still really liking it (that's 3 just this week!). I like how Stone Age does more with less. It's one of the simpler worker placement games, but it's still deep and compelling. 

* **Tales of The Arabian Nights** (5p, 1x) - After out game session got cancelled due to work destroying my weekend last week, I finally got to play TotAN! I was not disappointed, though I don't plan on ever playing it at such a high player count again. Such a story driven experience is really hampered by the long downtime, and there isn't really any planning to do on that time. Still, the stories created were amazing (on the first few turns, I, Sherazade, started out lost, from having argued with a Djinn, then got married, had my spouse die, tried to run from his people's custom of burying the widow with the dead husband, got caught, was left for dead, got saved by a graverobber that tried to loot my "corpse", limped to Bagdad, and then proceded to travel, meed an enchantress, get blassed and amass numerous skills throughout the game. Another one of us got arrested 3 different times). I'm really excited to try it out again with 3 or 4 people.

* **Sidereal Confluence** (4p, 1x) - Little context here. I got SidCon on preorder back in August, after hearing it was "Chinatown on crack", so I've been raring to play it for quite a while. My gaming group isn't really big on negotiation games, however, so it never got to the table. Yesterday, however, I finally got to play it, and I must say I seriously underestimated this game. I thought that, after playing **Chinatown** so many times, we'd start doing clever trades all around and everything would flow. What happened, instead, is that everyone kind of froze on the first few turns, without really knowing what was important and what wasn't. We randomly gave each of us a race. The Kt'whatever player and I, as the Yengii, kind of just focused on running as many converters as possible on every turn, with the Kt'whatever player (who won with a decent margin) getting as many of his colonies up as possible. The Caylion player didn't really try to sell his colonies, which I think might have hampered his game a bit, and the Unity player couldn't really get his economy going. This seems to be one of those games that makes it so that really benefits from people getting better at it. We didn't really get what was most important at each time, so the trading didn't really flow as well as it could. I really want to try it out again, especially with a larger player count.

* **Thunder & Lightning** (2p, 1x) - I ended the week with this clever card game of Norse Gods. I actually quite liked it, and I can't really put my finger on what was so special about it. It might be the way it uses the placement of the cards as lines of battle, and how you need to hide your crown/ring. It reminds me of a light **Android: Netrunner**.

***

*How do you handle rules mistakes that come up during the course of play when it effects all players?* 

If it affects everyone equally, there isn't really any harm to the mistake. We usually talk about it and just play it right from then on.

*How do address a single mistake made that might have benefited you? What if it's too late to fix that error?*

I usually just leave it to the group. Usually, if it can be easily fixed, we will. If not, we'll just roll with it. In extreme cases, if we're still in the beginning of the game, we might start over.

*What is the worst mistake or misunderstanding with a game you've had?*

I can think of 2: One was when we were playing **Seasons**, and one of the players (the owner of the game) got together a combo that instantly ended the game, screwing over everyone. We later found out that everyone else would still have a last turn after that, but the owner of the game, at the time, thought that wasn't the case. The other one was when we were playing **Cyclades** and didn't notice that you could only have one creature on an island, making it so that one of the players got permanently stuck to that island.
This question is asked pretty often, and I don't think there's a right answer.

Personally, I never think about kingmaking - I'd rather think of dethroning. If I'm playing with a group of very close friends, knowing that no one will be *too* upset about it, I just might take down whoever's winning just because it's funny (which I grant might lead to kingmaking whoever's on second place).

When playing with not so close friends, or with people who take the games more seriously, you'd better just focus on doing whatever move will be the best for you (even if that move involves stopping anyone from winning, so that you might be able to catch up), if only to avoid the conflict that will arise from kingmaking someone else.

The main issue, however, is that in some games, you might be completely out of the race with a good chunk of game left to play, and "kingmaking" (or any sort of influencing over who will win the game) might be a way to keep people engaged.
Not yet. Work has been getting in the way of me doing anything, really. I managed to make my first insert last week (for **Codenames**), and while it doesn't really look great, it's better than I expected (I'm *really* clumsy).

I think I'll still try some other stuff before tackling my plans for SidCon, since they involve multiple removable trays, on two layers, so I can't really afford having crooked walls.
Got to play a bunch of new games this week:

* **Bohnanza** (5p, 1x) - Played Bohnanza while we waited for someone to arrive to our game ~~night~~ day. Always a fun time. This time, we tied 10-10-10-10-11, which was particularly interesting.

* **Caverna** (6p, 1x) - When everyone had arrived, we started the day with Caverna. I know that people (at least on BGG) say that it only plays well with at most 5 people, but our group tends to play a lot faster than average and **Agricola** is the group's consensus number 1, so we decided to tackle that challenge... NEVER. AGAIN. The game itself was ok (not amazing), but it's nowhere close to good enough for 3:30 hours of play. I'd normally say I need to play it again before submitting my final opinion, but I'm not getting close to it again for a while.

* **Troyes** (3p, 1x) - For some reason, Troyes just didn't click for me. I had a really hard time actually grasping how everything worked (which is uncommon, I'm usually pretty good at learning new games), which led to me spending most of the game confused and not really enjoying it that much. I definitely want to give it another try, though. The ideas behind it are quite interesting and it plays so quick that there's no reason not to play it a few more times.

* **Village** (4p, 1x) - Guys, I don't know if you heard, but Village is *amazing*. Seriously. Maybe I should feel bad about it, but there are few thing quite as funny as people yelling at each other as they race for the mass slaughter of their villagers. It's a great mechanic and I had a lot of fun.

* **Istanbul** (3p, 1x) - I've been looking at Istanbul for quite some time, now, but finally got to play it. It was very interesting, and it seems like of of those games that I'll always be willing to play, will always have fun playing and will always, inevitably, lose. My only issue with it is that it seems that there will always be one specific optimal path to victory, which isn't really my thing (I prefer games that have you react to the board, rather than try to trace and follow a fixed strategy). Still, I quite liked it and would definitely be willing to play it more.

Would negotiation count as a mechanic? If so, that's my answer. I just love that direct interaction between players and the freedom that comes with it - the only limit is your own creativity, and everyone should pay attention to everything, just in case there's a deal around you somewhere. That being said, the game I've played that best implements negotiation is definitely **Chinatown**. 

The only rule to Chinatown is that you ~~don't talk about Chinatown~~ can't remove stores once they're placed on the board. Everything else is fair game. You want to sell that lot for 5 tiles? You can do that. Want to rent it for a turn? Can also do that. Want to make a 3 way trade, in which someone buys something for a conditional tile, if they manage to get it in the following 4 turns, with an opt out clause in case they get lot 43? You can do that.

I *love* it.

That being said, my gaming group isn't nearly as into it as I am, so I have a hard time getting negotiation games to the table. I got **Sidereal Confluence** on preorder, almost 2 months ago, and have yet to play it.
It's actually quite simple - most of the confusion comes from how different the mechanics are from most board games. Once you get it, everything tends to just click together.

There's only about 10 things you need to know:

* You get 6 tiles at the start of the game, and should replenish your "hand" at the end of every turn, so you always have 6 tiles.
* You have 2 actions every turn, which you can use to move a leader, place a tile or replace the tiles in your "hand".
* Leaders can only be placed next to red tiles;
* Whenever you place a colored tile, the leader of that color that is connected to it will gain a VP of that color. If there is no leader of the same color, the black leader will take it;
* If you place 4 tiles of the same color in a square, you make a monument of that color, which generates 1 VP of each of its colors per turn for the leaders of those colors in that region;
* When you place a catastrophe tile, you permanently destroy the tile you placed it on, effectively blocking anything that was or could be placed there;
* Whenever there are two leaders of the same color in the same kingdom, there is conflict: (i) if a new leader is placed on an existing kingdom, it's called a rebellion, and it's fought over red tiles - winning gives you 1 red VP; (ii) if the conflict happens because of 2 kingdoms being unified, it's called a war, and it's fought over tiles of the color of the conflicting leaders. Ties go to the defending leader.
* Whenever there are two or more treasures on a kingdom, all but one of them is given to the green leader of that kingdom. Treasures are worth 1VP of any color.
* The game ends when someone tries to get tiles from the bag and can't replenish their hand of 6 or when there are two or less treasures remaining on the board.
* Your final score is the number of VPs of which you have the least.

And that's saying pretty much everything you need to know. If you want to get going even faster, you could just explain (i) how to get points, (ii) how conflicts happen; and (iii) how scoring works, and teach the rest as the game goes.

I've once played it with someone who never plays board games, and we explained everything and had the game going in about 15 minutes, with him ending up well within everyone's scores. 
**Tigris & Euphrates** was a game that just shouted "masterpiece" to me when I first played it, and has only confirmed my perception of it ever since.
Yeah, I looked around and found nothing, so I decided to design my own.

I think I've finally finished my plans for it. I'll give it a shot and tell you if it works.
I'm thinking about just not having a floor for that part of the insert. I guess I'll just try it out and see how it looks before actually assembling everything and see how I feel about it.
This is a good one. 

I feel **Great Western Trail** is listed as heavy because there's just so much stuff going on at the same time. Before actually learning how to play, I watched it being played with no explanation whatsoever, and I was completely overwhelmed.

When you do learn it, though, everything just clicks together. It's the same feeling I get from **The Gallerist**, for example.
I've only played **The Gallerist** so far, but it was the first game I thought of when I saw this thread.

Sure, it does take a while to really *get* everything, but once you do, all the mechanics fit together so well that it just works perfectly.
The thing with **Skull**, like **Codenames**, as I've seen mentioned here, is that they don't really feel like board games, so I don't really think playing **Skull** would ever transition into playing something like **Stone Age**, for example.
1. **The Gallerist**;
2. **Agricola**;
3. **Alchemists**;
4. **Viticulture**;
5. **Stone Age**.
Most criticism I've seen regarding TotAN is about how you don't really have agency in it.

Even the good reviews (like SUSD's, for example) make a point of emphasys on how it is a game in which stuff happens at you, without you having much say in what ends up happening.

I will get my copy to the table for the first time on Saturday, and I have high expectations for it.

Regarding **The 7th Continent**, I completely agree with you. It seems really interesting, but there's no way I can afford paying that much money on a game I have no idea if I'll like.
You don't *have to* do anything. If you want to rate them, rate them. If you don't, then don't. Just like that.

As for me, I usually rate all the games I play mostly so they'll immediately show up in my collection. I'll also change the ratings whenever I feel like it.
From the games I own:

* **Onitama** - the box looks great and is perfectly funcional. Can't go wrong with that.

* **Inis** - Inis just might be my favorite looking board game in all aspects. That box is just gorgeous.

* **Tales of the Arabian Nights** - I don't really know what it is that I like so much about that box. It just looks really good, while also being kind of mysterious, bringing out my curiosity for the wonders contained inside. 
First of all, I want to make it clear that you are absolutely free to like whatever you want to like, and that I firmly believe there's no right or wrong in such lists, but you asked for our thoughts, so here are mine:

TBH, I have only played a few of those games, and can only comment on a couple more:

1 - **Smash Up** - Even though a couple of my friends own Smash Up, I was never even close to playing it, since, as someone else already said, it tends to be one of the first games that people set aside as they get into the hobby, and all of those friends were already way into it when I started out.

2 - **Game of Thrones the Board Game Second Edition** - I've heard a lot of mixed responses from this one. I know a few people who swear by it, but my gaming group *hates it*, so I never really got to give it a try. 

3 - **Eldritch Horror** - I get the appeal from Eldritch Horror. I really do. I understand how you might like the idea of banding together to fight an unspeakable horror. But it just might be my least favorite game of all. I think I might rather play Monopoly than play Eldritch Horror again. And it's not even the difficulty I care about - I like difficult. What I don't like is the possibility for me to get stuck on the same place forever because I can't seem to get a dice roll, with the consequence being basically "try again next turn", with the added possibility of getting "delayed". Seriously, I hate that game.

6 - **Mysterium** - This one I actually really like. It's not among my favorites, but it's a lot of silly fun that shines with the right group.

10 - **Magic the Gathering** - I used to be way into Magic, but eventually stopped playing it and won't really dare touch any cards again for the fear of rellapsing and falling down on that rabbit hole all over again. 

All in all, like I said, it's your list, and you should play whatever makes you happy. 
I came here expecting this.
I also find sleeving my cards pretty relaxing.
I wouln't really say that's the case, at least for me.

I do the same thing with video games, and they're not likely to run out any time soon.

Edit: just my imput on the subject - I often buy boardgames as a kind of replacement for playing boardgames. It makes no sense at all (and rationally, it should go the other way), but that's how I feel. When I *really* want to play boardgames, but can't, I'll often go online, look at games and end up buying something. 
I've only been into the hobby for 5 months, and while that means I can be very precise, it's also not a very large range for statistics, and I also tend to buy more games due to playing new games all the time, both old and new (I mean, I only played Race for the Galaxy for the first time this weekend).

1. I acquire 5 game per month, on average.
2. I think this might be too high, but I'm not really inclined to lower that amount in the near future, though I can see it happening as my collection starts to get sizeable. 
3. Not so far.
4. Yes, for the most part. 
5. As I said, not in the immediate future, but I can foresee a downwards trend later on.
Got to play a bunch of stuff this week, some of which I had been meaning to play for quite a while:

* **Ghost Blitz** (4p, 2x) - Ghost Blitz is one of two small box shenanigans games I've had the pleasure of discovering this week. I'm always amazed at how much fun and laughter can be contained in those tiny boxes. The way you will sometimes jump at a piece, just to realize your mistake as someone else is calmy getting the right, or how you'll just freeze looking at a card, makes for a great time. Worst case scenario, if someone doesn't like it, it only takes 15 minutes or so, so there's no harm. The only issue I can see with it is that when someone is deeply familiarized with the pieces he will tend to have an advantage against someone who is playing for the first time, but then again, I don't play this sort of games for the competition.

* **The Princes of Florence** (4p, 1x) - So I've played Princes of Florence for the second time, and it is just as good as the first. After having some time to think about, I can say that it is very close to being a perfect game for me, which most likely deserves a 10/10. I'm quite picky with my 10's, though, so I still plan on playing it some more just to be sure.

* **Onitama** (2p, 1x) - Not much to be said about Onitama. It was an intense match and I lost. It's still one of my favorite games.

* **Patchwork** (2p, 1x) - So, Patchwork. I finally got to play it, and I liked it a lot, but as a friend of mine said, there are quite a few 2 player games I'd rather play before it, so it loses some of its appeal. If I wanted to buy a tetris-like tile placement game, I'd probably get Barenpark, just because it has a higher player count.

* **Bohnanza** (4p, 1x) - Bohnanza is my gaming groups's current favorite as a filler game, for those time we don't want to play a full, heavy game, but also want something more complex than **Cockroach Poker**. It has also just become the second Uwe game that all of us own, which says a lot about how much we like it. We played it again this week and for the third time, it ended in a tie, which went my way, for once.

* **Terraforming Mars** (3p, 1x) - I've also played Terraforming Mars for the first time, and it was about as good as I had expected, which is to say I liked it, but didn't love it. I like how you can play your cards and get combos together, but I think there might just be a bit too much stuff. I want to give it another shot, now that I know what can happen, before I rule it off completely, but I'm sure that, at least for me, it doesn't live up to the hype. Not even close.

* **Race for the Galaxy** (3p, 1x) - Now this is game that I had been wanting to play for months, but never got to, and I must say that this one does live up to the hype. We only played the base game, but I absolutely loved it. I mean, between Race for the Galaxy and Terraforming Mars, I'd play Race every single time. It has cards that I can combo together, it plays much, much faster and I feel like everything just fits together better. 

* **Modern Art** (3p, 1x) - There's a curious story with this one. I was interested in this game for a while, now, and when a friend of mine got it, I was really excited to play it. However, it got to the table before I arrived on our game night, due to me having to work late, and I didn't get to play, but just watch everyone as they screamed their way into getting the works of art they wanted. I loved it. I couldn't possibly go wrong with a game that made me have so much fun just watching it, so I purchased it myself a couple of days later, and got it to the table with another group this weekend. It was just as fun as I expected, with Reiner Knizia once again surprising me with his simple, yet ellegant designs.

* **Puerto Rico** (3p, 1x) - I finally got my brother to play Puerto Rico! And just as I had expected, he complained throughout the whole game about how badly he was playing and how he was going to lose, and yet he won, as it often happens with him. Still, I'm always up to play Puerto Rico, and I had just as much fun as I always do.

* **Blend Off!** (4p, 1x) - This is the other small box shenanigans game I got to play this week, and I dare say it is just as crazy as Ghost Blitz, albeit in a very different way. While in Ghost Blitz, you play to best your opponents, trying to be the fastest go get the right piece, in Blend Off! you're just franctly rolling your die as you try to get those drinks ready, all the while screaming like a mad man. It is just mindless fun.

* **Ra** (5p, 1x) - Ra is the most recent Knizia Game I've played, and it is great. You obviously can't just go after his name when you're blindly getting a game (I don't think it would be reasonable to expect all his over 600 games to be good), but when he gets it right, he gets it *right*. Ra, like Modern Art, is basically an auction game, but while in Modern Art you're spending your money (which are essentially your victory points), in Ra you're spending your possibilities of going for other auctions. I love how you'll sometimes pass on a good row of tiles just because you might want something else later and don't want to be so vulnerable without your tiles, or how you'll sometimes go for a bad row just because there's that juicy 16 on the board. Like all the good Knizia games, it is simple, but it is also incredibly clever, and I definitely want to play again.

* **Loony Quest** (5p, 1x) - We ended the week with Loony Quest, which is the newest game of my collection, and definitely the silliest. Which is a good thing, in my books. I like the heavy euros as much as the next crazy board gamer, but I also believe some sillyness is great sometimes. It's why I love **Galaxy Trucker**, **Cockroach Poker**, **Ghost Blitz** and **Camel Up**, and why I'm sure I'll like **Tales of the Arabian Nights** when I finally get it to the table. Loony Quest is just silly, but so much fun. I'm glad I got it.

That might be it.
I thought about that, but I clicked on the links and confirmed it (besides, two of them were **Great Western Trail** - which only has one edition, AFAIK - and **El Grande Big Box**)
I saw a couple of games on my top 100 that I have definitely rated.
You got a bunch of good recommendations already (and I'll add mine to **Alchemists**, even if they might not technically be wizards), but I feel the need to direct you to one of my favorite board game related videos ever, by the great people of Shut Up and Sit Down: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtCzsCMYnCE&t=1456s
This is definitely my case. I found out about T&E a couple of months ago, just got Modern Art last week and am currently on the hunt for Samurai.
**Suburbia**, easily.
I had never even thought about that until now, so I'll say no.
I saw it and thought it was pretty interesting, but at the very least, if I only wanted the base game, it would cost me $80 (game) + $40 (lowest estimated shipping to South America) + $ 72 (import taxes) = $ 192. 

With that money I could get a bunch of other games.
A friend of mine has been into them for years, and basically dragged me into the hobby. I had already played games like **Catan** and **Eldritch Horror**, but neither really hooked me (later on I'd realize I'm not really a fan of dice in board games).

Earlier this year, however, we were in a trip to the US and he took us to Cool Stuff Inc, in Maitland, FL. It was only when I saw all those shelves and shelves of games that I realized how vast and varied board gaming could be. Later that day we played **Onitama** and **Clank!** on the hotel. 

...5 months later, I've logged about 130 plays of over 50 different games, own about 20 and get together with my gaming group at least once a week, and often more.

My advice would be to just go to the meetup. In my (short) experience, all people want is to have more people to share the hobby with, and will be happy to help you out.
I actually see him no wanting to buy a game because he knows you own it already, which seems to me as a being quite reasonable (not my case - I like to own my games).

I'd see an issue if he was asking you to buy games that he wanted to play, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
...or in the top 1000.
Ok, here are some suggestions for some more complex games, without getting into anything too difficult:

First, three simple abstract games with some great depth:

* **Onitama** - 2-player abstract game in which you exchange movement cards with your oponent trying to defeat their master;

* **Hive** - 2-player absctract game in which you place different insects in a hive, each moving in a different way, trying to trap the opponents queen;

* **Tak** - Tak is the closest to feeling like a "classic" abstract like chess or go I've even seen a modern game get, and that is some high praise. 

But you were looking for somehting meatier, so let's look at something different:

* **Clank!** - Clank! was the first board game that actually blew me away. It's a deck builder in which each of the players are knights delving into a dungeon guarded by a dragon. The goal is to go inside, get some treasure and get out without getting eaten. Every turn you draw 5 cards and play all of them, and the cards will basically give you either skill points (which let you buy more cards), movement (which lets you move on the board), swords (which let you fight monsters for rewards) or "clanks", which will make you place some cubes of your color in a bag. Every once in a while, a card will be drawn to the board with a dragon marker in it, and the dragon will attack by taking a number of cubes from the bag. If one of yours get taken out, you take damage. Take enough damage and you die.    
**Clank!** is a clever, thematic twist on deck building, and it is a ton of fun. 

* **Suburbia** - Suburbia is a tile placement game in which everyone is trying to build their own city. Each turn, you'll buy a tile from the board and place it on your suburbs, and each tile brings consequences to the other ones. The trick here is that you have to balance getting income, which will allow you to buy more tiles, and reputation, which will give you population (AKA points). It's an amazing game.    
If that interests you, you could also take a look at **Castles of Mad King Ludwig**, which is very game, which makes some good changes to the game. My only gripe with it is that it's too short, and always seems to end when you've barely started building your castle.

* **Concordia** - Concordia is one of my favorite games ever (and this sub's current number 9). The mechanics are incredibly simple: every turn you play one of 8 or so different types of card, which will let you an action like building houses, producing goods from those houses or getting more cards. The brilliant thing here is that the cards no only give you actions, but also multiply your points at the end, so you're always choosing between doing what you need to do in the board, getting cards that will let you do more of what you want, or getting cards that will give you the most points. It's just amazing.

* **Puerto Rico** - Puerto Rico is another one of my favorite games. Your goal is to get points by shipping goods, which you'll get by developing your plantation and your city. The great thing about Puerto Rico, IMO, is that on every turn, each player will choose an action to perform, and *everyone* will do that action if they can (with the player that chose it getting a bonus). That being the case, much of the game is picking the right action at the right time, both to get your objectives and to deny people theirs. I love it.

* **Castles of Burgundy** - One of the classics from the great designer Stefan Feld, Castles of Burgundy has you rolling dice to get and place tiles on your board, trying to fill it up and get points from it. If you get bad rolls, however, you can spend "workers" to change the roll, which makes the game that much more strategic. You can't go wrong with it.

* **Tigris and Euphrates** - Some pople might say T&E might be too complex, but I disagree. Tigris and Euphrates is one of my favorite examples of games that are simple to learn, but hard to master. The core mechanics are simple: every turn, you'll do two actions, which will basically be moving one of your leaders or placing a tile. Whenever you place a tile in a kingdom (which is a group of adjacing tiles with a Leader), the leader of that color gets a point of that color. Whenever you have two leaders of the same color in a kingdom, they fight, and the winner gets points. At the end of the game, you count how many points of each color your have and the final score is the one you have the least of. Knowing when and where to place your tiles, when to start a fight and when to back away are the keys to winning, and you never know how well you are until the game is over.      
If you want depth, **Tigris and Euphrates** is what you want.    
I was really excited to play **Arctic Scavengers**, but was disappointed. 

I love the idea of the game and the combat for the hidden cards is pretty interesting, but I really didn't like how the only way to get medicine was to get it on the junk pile, which can make it so that one lucky player can monopolize all the cards that need it.

I've heard the expansions make up for that, but I have yet to try them out.
After playing almost no games last week due to work, I managed to get back on track this week:

* **Hive** (6x, 2p) - Hive is rising up to be one of my favorite abstract games. It is full of those bright moments when everything seems lost and then you see a couple of moves that will just manage to pop your queen free and turn the tables on everything. It also looks great and can be played by the pool, if that's something you might want to do.

* **Cockroach Poker** (1x, 5p; 2x, 6p) - It's a recurring joke that I always lose in Cockroach Poker (which is unfortunately backed by data), but we played it three times this week and I didn't lose any of them! That's definitely a new record. 

* **Great Western Trail** (1x, 4p) - And so, my winning streak is over. Two more turns and I might be able to get to San Francisco again and get a whopping 17 more points, winning me the game, but we can't always have what we want. We always play with the starting tiles shuffled, and this time it made the game mich tighter than usual, as the paths weren't optimized at all. I really love how this makes GWT so different every time we play.

* **El Grande** (1x, 5p) - Messed up badly on a few turns, which took me out of the race, but El Grande is always good. 
I really like how things can change up on every single turn.

* **Concordia** (1x, 5p) - One of the guys wasn't really that much into it, but we had a pretty good game, that ended closer than I had expected. Concordia is one of those games I love even though I suck at it. 

* **Onitama** (1x, 2p) - Onitama is actually the reason I don't think **Hive** will ever become my favorite abstract game. I just love how elegant it is. 

* **Bohnanza** (1x, 5p) - Lost it, *again*, on the tiebreaker. I hate when that happens.

* **Princes of Florence** (1x, 5p) - One of the best things about being new to the hobby is how you seem find a new masterpiece every month. July's was **Chinatown**, August's was **Tigris and Euphrates**. September's masterpiece is **Princes of Florence**. Granted, I've only played it once so far, but I had a lot of fun with its combination of auctions and tile placement.

***

My favorite board gaming memory just might be the time I really understood how vast modern board gaming could be. About 5 months ago, I was travelling with some friends to the US, and one of them was really into board games, so he had us go to CSI in Maitland. I had already played some stuff and thought it was ok, but it was only when I entered that store and saw the shelves and shelves of different games that I realized how many possibilities the hobby brought with it. Since then I've logged almost 150 plays of about 60 different games and am still looking for more and different games.
I'd honestly just stream and play the matchups. At least that's what I'm doing, after ending the draft with Dalton.
It's funny how differently people think. I came here to say that I'd think it would be perfect if he would just remove the horns.
I wouldn't really trust any of them as a weekly starter this year.
I'm facing Gurley, Pierre Garcon and Carlos Hyde this week. I still can't believe this is happening.
I'd personally go with Goff, and have actually just made a claim for him on waivers. 
**Suburbia**. Love the game, but I'm just awful at it.
I desperately want to play **Sidereal Confluence**.
That's actually the first thing that made me think about it. I might be able to work with that.

Still, it seems like a big mess up that the creators didn't bother making a clear statement on the subject.
That's not really my problem with it, though. I'm fine with including slaves as a game mechanic. What I'm not fine with is calling them colonists.
It is! It's actually a shorter, competitive alternative to **Catacombs** that was on Kickstarter about two months ago.
Unless the game **Puerto Rico** is set in an alternate reality, yes, they are slaves.

As u/MrAbodi said, they are brown people that come in boats and are delivered to work in plantations.

I absolutely love the game, but it really bothers me that they are called colonists. I'd be fine with "workers", but calling them colonists is just pretending that a terrible part of history never happened.
Mine is **Catacombs Conquest**, which is only supposed to ship on March 2018 :(
That's really weird. I got mine from Miniature Market and it has already arrived here in Brazil.

Is there any way you can get a refund on your order and get it somewhere else?
My case is the opposite. I've played **Descent**, but didn't really like it (TBH, I didn't see much of a point in it). It made me kind of scared of the dungeon crawler genre.

**Gloomhaven** seems really interesting, but I'm not willing to pay the price with the risk of me just not liking dungeon crawlers as a whole.
I'm a firm believer that no game is too heavy. At most you'll have a steeper learning curve, but all the rules and mechanics fit perfectly together, so once you grasp how the systems work, everything just clicks.

I got **Sidereal Confluence** on preorder, but still haven't managed to get it to the table. I have high hopes for it.
The **The Gallerist** is amazing (I just threw together a Top 10 list for another thread and it's my number 4). It's not that difficult, just not intuitive at a first glance. It usually takes a couple of turns for you to understand how everything works.

I'd definitely recommend it.
Ok, I'll go for it (taking games rated 8+, out of 82 rated games):

* **22** in the 1-100; (22 per 100)
* **14** in the 100-500; (3.5 per 100)
* **3** in the 500-1000; (0.6 per 100)
* **2** in the 1000-2000 (0.2 per 100)

As for my Top 10 (which changes a lot, so I'll just throw something out here):

1. **Chinatown** (347);
2. **Tigris & Euphrates** (61);
3. **Puerto Rico** (12);
4. **The Gallerist** (70);
5. **Inis** (158);
6. **Concordia** (30);
7. **Agricola** (15);
8. **Onitama** (193);
9. **Food Chain Magnate** (25);
10. **Twilight Struggle** (3).

So that's 7 out of my Top 10 on BGG's Top 100, with 5 being on the Top 50. I guess that is to be expected, due to few games I've played overall.

That being said, if I check the percentages of high rated games in each range, I'd get:

* 1-100: 22/30 (**73%**);
* 100-500: 14/32 (**43%**);
* 500-1000: 3/8 (**36%**);
* 1000-2000: 2/7 (**28%**);
* 2000+: 0/5 (**0%**).

So I still have higher percentages of high rated games among the higher rankings, but that could be due to me cutting off at 8, so I've risen the bar to 8.5, which changes the table like this:

* 1-100: 15/30 (**50%**);
* 100-500: 8/32 (**25%**);
* 500-1000: 0/8 (**0%**);
* 1000-2000: 1/7 (**14%**);
* 2000+: 0/5 (**0%**).

...I guess I'm a conformist.
* *Do the rankings play a large role when you decide which games to buy?*

The short answer is no. The long answer is that while I don't really look at the rankings when I'm looking for a game, higher ranked games tend to gather more visibility (which tends to gather more players and reviews, making it rise even more), so it's more likely for me to find things about it and let it pique my interest. Since my collection is still small (only 20 games so far, not counting the kickstarter which hasn't arrived yet), that happens even more, with the most popular games jumping up to me. Such being the case, the rankings end up playing a large, albeit indirect, role in my decision of which games to buy.

* *How many of your games are ranked in the top 100?*

My collection looks like this:

1-100: 10
100-200: 5
200-1000: 2
1000+:3 
I can't talk about all his game, but **The Gallerist** was the first game that came to mind when I read the title.
* **The Game** - simple coop game of placing cards in an increasing or decreasing order. I don't remember the last gaming night our group had without playing The Game;

* **Bohnanza** - another simple game, this one by the great Uwe Rosenberg, about harvesting and trading beans;

* **Cockroach Poker** - lie to your friends and laugh in games of at most 10 minutes. *That's definitely not a cockroa-- shit that's a cockroach*.
I think it depends on what you're looking for. I got Witten at the draft for his solid floor, but ASJ could explode.
Oh, it's possible, but not really feasable in a 3 or 4 player game (at least I can barely keep track of how many of each card I have). That's why I left that "really" italicized.
I own and love both games, so my not-so-helpful answer will be that it depends on what you're looking for. Both games are pretty simple and easy to learn (both basically have you play a card every turn and do whatever it's written on it), yet extremely intelligent.

**Concordia** has amazing depth, but it feels lighter than most euros, especially since you can never *really* know who is winning the game. There is some denial and a whole lot of strategy, but it doesn't really feel like you're fighting each other for resources.

**Inis**, on the other hand, has everything in the open, and the victory conditions make it a deceptively cutthroat game. Games will often end up with people fighting to deny others their victory conditions or, bizarrely enough, working towards giving another player *their* condition, so you can keep the game going while you search for an opportunity for your own victory.

They are two amazing games, that scratch very different itches. 
I actually got **Sidereal Confluence** on preorder, but still haven't managed to get it to the table.
Games usually take about an hour, though I've once played an almost 3-hour long game, due to everyone working to stop others from winning just as much as trying to win themselves.
> Not helped by the fact that often you feel like you know that there's GOT to be a way to win on this turn if you were only smart enough.

Or worse: there's GOT to be a way to stop *that guy* from winning on this turn if you were only smart enough.
Work was intense this week, so I only managed to play a 2 player game of **Tigris & Euphrates**.

...it did not go very well. 

I was playing with someone who had never played before and he made some mistakes at the start, let me build a good position and basically tilted as I build 2 monuments and started getting 1 point of each color every turn.

It took him way too long to actually try and start a war as a way of taking me out using some less owned tile colors (I only had like 2 black tiles supporting me).

By the end, he said he liked the game, but was frustrated as he believed he had already lost by the 3rd turn, which I guess is better than nothing.

***

* Poll: I've backed a grand total of one game on Kickstarter, which was **Catacombs Conquest**.

* In theory, my next purchase would be **Cosmic Encounter**, but I'm most likely impulse-buying something until then. If I could add any game to my collection, my heart would go with **Chinatown**, which just might be my favorite game of all time and is out of print, by the rational choice would probably be **Gloomhaven**, since I really want to try it out and it's also pretty hard to get and even more expensive.
My friends and I just make it so that the Spymasters decide whether a clue is legal or not, so they can just ask each other. 
I'm not sure about how I feel about it. I wouldn't really feel comfortable asking for money to buy games that would be in my personal collection, but I might be ok if everyone pitched in for a group collection of some sort.
I'd say that's true if you're playing with people with vastly different skill levels. 

I definitely agree that FCM is a punishing game, but you'd have to *really* mess up to lose on the first turn. 

I've seen some interesting comebacks in FCM. There are so may great swing moves that can change everything at once.
CAH needs people who both don't actually care about winning (because it's freaking CAH, there's no point to any of that) and are willing to think outside the box for funny answers.
The team could not even go to the game and they would still beat the Jets.
With the AFCE the way it is, it's hard to bet against the Patriots making it.
There's a PnP version of it on their website.
I'm pretty sure there's a Watch it Played video for **The Gallerist**. It seems a bit overwhelming at first, but everything clicks in place after a couple of turns.

You should definetely check it out.
**The Gallerist** is one of those games you finish your first time wanting to play again, now that you really get how things work.
I'm going to try, once again, to play **Sidereal Confluence** and **Imperial 2030** this weekend, but I might end up not being able to play anything.

I'll at least coerce my brother to play **Tigris and Euphrates** with me.
I picked the helmet and my next exotic was the helmet.
I know, I just went with BGGs listing 
2007 - **Agricola**

2008 - **Cosmic Encounter**

2009 - **Imperial 2030**

2010 - **Troyes** 

2011 - **Mage Knight**

2012 - **Terra Mystica**

2013 - **Concordia**

2014 - **Onitama**

2015 - **The Gallerist**

2016 - **Inis**

2017 - **Sidereal Confluence**
I started making a real list and got to about 17 different games, so I'll just focus on two really special ones:

* **Chinatown** - Chinatown revealed to me my love for negotiation games and by the second time I played it I was sure that was my favorite board game of all. Unfortunately I can't get it anywhere, with it being out of print and me living in Brazil (I'd absolutely pay something like 100 dollars for it, but shipping and importing taxes would double that price, so that's a no go). I recently got **Sidereal Confluence**, which has been compared to Chinatown a lot, but hadn't been able to play it yet.

* **Agricola** - For some strange reason, I was pretty sure I wouldn't like Agricola. I wanted to play it because it was a huge classic, but my expectations were pretty low - I just felt like it wasn't my kind of game. I think it suffices to say that I played it for the first time on a Friday night and had my own copy by tuesday (and that's only because it was sold out at my LFGS).

I cheated and made a top 6. 

1. **Chinatown** - can't find this even close to a decent price;
2. **The Gallerist** - the company that publishes it in Brazil is shady as hell, so I'd rather not buy anything from them. Besides, the box quality of their edition is awful. I'll try to get it abroad;
3. **Food Chain Magnate** - it's not published in Brazil and is already pretty expensive in the US, so I'm not willing to deal with importing taxes;
4. **Clank!** - I'm probably getting **Clank! In! Space!** when it's released here;
5. **Great Western Trail** - played it for the first time this month and it's owned by one of my closest friends, so I can play his if I want to;
6. **Terra Mystica** - my gaming group of 6 people has 5 copies of Terra Mystica, so I don't really need another one.

Tigris and Euphrates would definetely be on my list if only it didn't arrive yesterday.
I usually explain the types of cards available (such as Geis and Festival) so the new player won't be at a disavantage at the draft.
I don't know about TGZ, but I've played T&E with a friend who won't usually play any board games, and we had it going in about 15 minutes.

While the game is not really simple, the rules aren't really that complicated. There are just about 10 things you need to know to play the game, and they work with each other in an intuitive way: 

* You get 6 tiles at the start of the game, and should replenish your "hand" at the end of every turn, so you always have 6 tiles.

* You have 2 actions every turn, which you can use to move a leader, place a tile or replace the tiles in your "hand".

* Leaders can only be placed next to red tiles;

* Whenever you place a colored tile, the leader of that color that is connected to it will gain a VP of that color. If there is no leader of the same color, the black leader will take it;

* If you place 4 tiles of the same color in a square, you make a monument of that color, which generates 1 VP of each of its colors per turn for the leaders of those colors in that region;

* When you place a catastrophe tile, you permanently destroy the tile you placed it on, effectively blocking anything that was or could be placed there;

* Whenever there are two leaders of the same color in the same kingdom, there is conflict: (i) if a new leader is placed on an existing kingdom, it's called a rebellion, and it's fought over red tiles - winning gives you 1 red VP; (ii) if the conflict happens because of 2 kingdoms being unified, it's called a war, and it's fought over tiles of the color of the conflicting leaders. Ties go to the defending leader.

* Whenever there are two or more treasures on a kingdom, all but one of them is given to the green leader of that kingdom. Treasures are worth 1VP of any color.

* The game ends when someone tries to get tiles from the bag and can't replenish their hand of 6 or when there are two or less treasures remaining on the board.

* Your final score is the number of VPs of which you have the least.

And that's saying pretty much everything you need to know. If you want to get going even faster, you could just explain (i) how to get points, (ii) how conflicts happen; and (iii) how scoring works, and teach the rest as the game goes.
I hated the boot to orbit mechanic. If they at least made it so you had the option to just start over I'd be fine with it, but having to wait to go to orbit, then wait to go back into the Nightfall, then waiting for the cinematic was annoying as hell.
This. We managed to beat the Nightfall last night with an average of about 250 ~~light~~ power on my fireteam with 5 minutes remaining, even after wiping a couple of times. Even though the other two had already done it, it was my first attempt.

Even if you do it safe and steadily, you should be able to do it in time.
My only real issue with the crucible right now is the 4-people fireteams. It basically means that you'll always leave someone behind if you decide to do something else.

On the other hand, if you have enough friends playing with you that you can form 2 fireteams, so everyone is happy for most content, some people will have to stay behind for the crucible.

It just seems like an odd design choice for me. If your base structure is of 3 people, why make something for 4?
I'd say at most one role could be called redundant in **Captain Sonar**, which is the first mate. 

The roles work best to make the game faster. The Radio Operator couldn't possibly take 2 different roles at once and if the Captain had to do everything else it would slow down the game way too much.
While I understand where you're coming from, **Captain Sonar** is way too intense for me to put it together with party games.

I seriously recommend it.
Trying to get a different point of view here: not about the looks and minis, by themselves, but how intriguing the game looks from outside.

* **Inis** - the game looks *gorgeous*, with the perfectly fitted weird shaped tiles, the minis, citadels and temples.

* **Battlestar Galactica** - get all those ships around the galactica and you can just see the insurmountable odds the humans are facing.

* **The Gallerist** - the board looks nice enough by itself, but the three pieces up for the internation auction, on their stands, look *amazing*.

* **Tigris & Euphrates** - it's not how good it looks as much as how interesting. You can't just pass by a table of T&E and not stop and look at how those tiles creep together. I think it's much like how people will look at a chess table being played.

* **Sidereal Confluence** - Look at all those millions of cards on the table, with the colonies, ships and weird races and tell me you wouldn't be curious about it.
I know it's just my personal taste, but **Eldritch Horror** is probably the single game that I've played that I hated the most. It's one of the very few games I don't think I'd ever agree to play again.

I've only tried it 2 or 3 times, but had some awful experiences that I don't intend on repeating. Everytime I think about it I figure we must have played it wrong every single time (on both groups I've played with).

The rolling to resolve mechanic, by itself, already pisses me off. I've once cycled the entire deck of cards of one location because I kept rolling badly. It was a huge streak of bad luck, but the fact that it's possible, without anything interesting happenning throughout that period, is enough to make me never want to play it again. 

Add to that the possibility of being *delayed* and it becomes a game that is way more frustrating than it is fun.

I get the appeal of facing insurmountable odds trying to beat an unspeakable horror, but it's definetely not a game for me.
You might just not like the hidden role mechanic by itself. **Battlestar Galactica** is an interesting game overall, with a hidden role mechanic that's perfectly mixed with everything, and **Sheriff of Nottingham**, while being about reading people, doensn't have you trying to figure out what people are doing and why they're doing it.

The three you mentioned, however, are only about those hidden roles. 
I've played a lot of **Illuminati** over the years, and have really mixed feelings about it.

I acually like the mechanics and even how it looks, but I must agree that it takes FOREVER to play. I feel like it's a great game that stretches out for 3 times as long as it should. 

My cousins always come over for Christmas and they always want to play Illuminati, and I get tired just thinking about it. With some luck they'll agree to play different games now that we have more options.
I think most people agree that these games are at least ok. Most criticism I see about them is that they're overrated.
Whenever someone asks me about **Catan**, I just say that it's a game about rolling dice and getting upset. 
My issue with **Joking Hazard** is that the panel structure really restricts the possible answers. I more often than not would see a card that would be a perfect ending for a comic, if only it showed the other character.

Contrary to pretty much everyone, I actually like **Cards Against Humanity**, but that's mostly because I don't care about who wins or loses. It doesn't matter that the most offensive wins, as long as there are some people who actually try to make interesting combinations.

...being drunk usually helps.
Here's the thing: there are A LOT of stuff on the expansions. Some I liked, some I didn't.

I really like the new ships. They add a level of complexity that's interesting, but still manageable. Some of the new tiles from the expansions are also really, really interesting.

I think it all boils down to findind what works and what doesn't, and what combinations work best.
We did that, and it really switches everything up.
Oh, boy, this is going to take a while. A friend of mine decided to make a board gaming extravaganza for his birthday, which meant about 14 hours of boardgaming on Saturday.

* **Great Western Trail** (3p, 1x) - Got to play this again this week (and won!), and it keeps getting better. So far, I've played 3 games of GWT, with one being won basically from the buildings (with the guy who focused on cows close behind), the second from the city markers and the third from the train stations, which shows that there isn't one perfect strategy. A great game overall, and one of my group's current favorites.

* **Galaxy Trucker** (3p, 1x) - Got to play Galaxy Trucker with different expansions this, and I'm not quite sure about how I feel regarding the invaders/intruders/whateverthey'recalled. While in the base game I frequently felt that how well you did had a lot to do with luck, the expansions get me feeling that I'm inevitably going to constantly get screwed over. There isn't a feeling of accomplishment as much as just pure relief when the run is over. Got to play it some more times to decide how I feel about it.

* **Onitama** (2p, 3x) - It had been a while since I had last played Onitama, and it's still great. Can't wait to get my hands on the expansion.

* **Tigris & Euphrates** (3p, 1x) - Tigers and Pots keeps rising on my list of favorite games. I love it. And I won again! Couldn't get any better.

* **Keyflower** (4p, 1x) - Keyflower is very interesting. I really liked it, but it wasn't a game that *clicked* in my head. I usually get games pretty fast, and can see how everything works and what are some decent strategies (I don't usually bother finding the perfect strategy, since I try to avoid AP as much as possible, but I tend to be able to find something that works). With Keyflower, however, I couldn't really grasp how everything was connected (much like what happened with **Five Tribes**, though they're nothing alike). I definetely want to play more of it.

* **Suburbia** (3p, 1x) - Playing Suburbia is always a delight, even if I'm awful at it. This time was no different, with me ending up dead last, not even close to second place. It was still a lot of fun, though, as I thoroughly failed at accomplishing any of my objectives.

* **Inis** (3p, 1x) - Stayed a couple of months without playing Inis, and I must say it was way too long. Our last experience was a bit traumatic, with the game lasting over 3 hours, but I still love the game just as much as when I first played it. This time it was over in just about an hour, as the winner managed to accomplish two victory conditions out of nowhere. I managed to shake things up and get one, but there was nothing we could do about the second one.

* **Cockroach Poker** (4p, 1x) - Quick game of Cockroach Poker, lost again. Just another sunday night.

* **Bohnanza** (3p, 3x; 4p, 1x) - What a fun little game. Plant some beans, trade some beans, harvest some beans, yell as you're forced to reap your oh-so-close-to-10-blue-beans field. It's a great, funny game that can switch from friendly trades to incredibly cutthroat negotiation on just about 30 minutes.

* **King of Tokyo** (6p, 1x) - It was my little cousin's birthday, and we got him King of Tokyo and played a match. I really like the game, but didn't have as much fun playing as we got constantly interrupted, people screamed all around while we tried to get the game going. The game was won by one of us getting 20 points after 3 of the 6 had already died.

* **Hive** (2p, 2x) - Played it twice: the first I got crushed in about 5 minutes, the second I won after quite a while of defending and attacking from both sides. Fast, smart and great-looking. I'm definetely getting this one for my collection.

* **The Game** (4p, 2x) - WE FINALLY WON. I couldn't believe it when it happened, but we really did it. 4 people, zero cards left. Suck on that, **The Game**.

***

* I own exactly 20 games, and while I really like my collection, I'm definetely not satisfied. I'll try to sell my **Android: Netrunner Core Set** and am looking into getting more games as I manage to get the money for it.

* I've yet to play a Legacy game, and I'm pretty curious about it, but it tends to put me off of a game more than the opposite, since it makes it that much harder for it to actually get played. 
But that would be so you can teach the game from the outside, not because you think it would work better than the app.
That's a huge part of what makes Puerto Rico one of my favorite games of all time.
Because the game is not about making the experiments. In it's core, **Alchemists** is a worker placement game about using the ingredients in an intelligent way so you can deduct the answers. 

The app just makes it easier, taking the place of a "codemaster" so you don't need someone to stay out of the game so the others can play.
**Alchemists** does offer that possibility (there's a separate board in which you can shuffle the ingredients), though you're the first person I ever saw who would be willing to do it.
Next release: Clank! In! A! Different! Dimension! Of! Fire! 
Right? I saw the change in the first line and knew I wouldn't be disappointed.
I understand it. I love the sight of my shelves filled with board games, and love the feeling of buying a new game, opening it and organizing the components.

If I had the money for it, I'd buy all the games I thought looked interesting and would play them as I could - sometimes you might end up getting more games than you actually get to play, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.

Since I can't do that, I only buy games I want to play, but even then I sometimes buy games I don't really need to. 

Take **Agricola**, for example: there are 6 people in my gaming group, and 6 copies of Agricola. The odds of me getting to play Agricola with anyone else are pretty slim, so I didn't need to buy it. However, I liked it so much that I wanted to own it, even if the only times I'd play it would be with someone who already had it.
This week started slow, but had an amazing finish:
 
* **Cockroach Poker** (5p, 3x) - only managed to get out of work late on monday, so I only got to play the small box games. That said, I still love cockroach poker and am absolutely fine with playing just that.
 
* **The Game** (5p, 2x; 3p, 2x) - The Game is pretty simple: you have 4 columns, 2 starting from 1, going up, and 2 starting from 100, going down. On each player's turn, he has to place at least two cards on the board, following the column's rule. You also can't tell what cards you have to the other players. I had already played this beauty on the app, but it's so much more fun playing it in a group, in person. The way you feel when someone places a card that is just a bit too high (or too low) for you to place yours there, and how you try to communicate what you have, without actually saying the numbers, is so difficult and at the same point so ridiculously funny. I absolutely love it.

* **Galaxy Trucker** (4p, 1x) - This was our first time playing with any of the expansions, and it was intense. Crazy ships, insane encounters and the evil machinations made everything even funnier than usual - everyone lost their ships at least once (I lost mine using the spherical ship and 2 perfectly aimed big meteors, which took down half my ship, at first, which was followed by all my remaining crew members).

* **Castles of Mad King Ludwig** (3p, 1x) - I love games about building things (which, to be honest, is most games), and I love tile placement. Thus being, I had no doubt in my mind that I would like this game. I was right. Castles of Mad King Ludwig is a very interesting game, with some brilliant little ideas. Having a master builder pick the pricing of the tiles, which people will have to purchase from him, is just genius, and solves the little problem I have with **Suburbia**, which is that you can effectively be shut out of getting some tiles due to bad luck. The only issue I had with it, though (which is why I still like **Suburbia** more) is that it's way too short. I think they could have placed twice as many tiles and let people build some really gigantic castles.

* **Great Western Trail** (3p, 2x) - Every once in a while, I see a game that everyone says is amazing and for absolutely no reason whatsoever develop this certainty that I won't like it. That was the case with **Agricola** (which I love), and it was the case with **Great Western Trail**. I'm not sure what it was about that made me think I wouldn't like it, but I was ready to be disappointed when we got it to the table. Once more, I was very, very wrong. GWT is an amazing game, with many different ways of winning. I really, really, really like it.

* **Tigris & Euphrates** (3p, 1x; 4p, 1x) - While I loved GWT way more than I thought I would, it was still not the best game I played this week. That prize goes, without a doubt, to Tigris & Euphrates (or Tigers and Pots, as those wonderful people from SUSD got us calling it). I played Tigers and Pots for the first time on thursday, and again on Sunday, and it is easily among my top-10 favorite games. I love everything about it. There's equal portions of strategy and conflict, and watching the kingdoms creep through the board, as it approaches an inevitable war, is way more exciting than I could ever expect. It could be biased from having just played it for the first time (and probably am), but right now I'd dare say that, to me, Tigers and Pots is a perfect game.
I think it always depends on how willing they are to learn a new game.

I'd be more willing to try and teach something like **The Gallerist** to someone who is open minded and actually willing to learn than **Carcassonne** to someone who isn't.
The fun from playing the ghost is somethink like playing the spymaster (or whatever theyre called) in Codenames. You get ridiculously frustrated from how hard it is to get cards that might perhaps fit on a certain objective and really, really happy when they actually get it right.
It's chaotic, funny and amazing. 
Sim!
While I'm not yet sure on how I fell about game itself (history shows people tend not to do their research on these things), comparing the favelas to gas chambers is downright insulting to every single victim to the Holocaust - not to mention the people from the favelas, themselves.

I'm not saying life in the favelas is easy, but it's not even close to what people went through under the Nazi regime.

I believe u/BoringBotanist said all it had to be said about life in the favelas. There *is* definetely serious issues with crime and poverty, but if you think 6% of the country's population is living in "horror" alike to nazism, you should seriously reconsider how much you think you know about Brazil.


Alright, this was a week of lighter gaming:

* **Cockroach Poker** (4p/6p x 5000) - I think I just might have a new favorite party game. Cockroach Poker is as easy as it's silly, and just as fun. It's the simplest of bluffing mechanics, and yet it's so ridiculously funny. I'm adding this one to my collection as soon as I can.

* **Stier zoekt Bier** (5p, 1x) - With so many good games around, I have a really hard time understanding why this one got translated here in Brazil. While I wouldn't necessarily say it is *bad*, it's definetely not great, and might not even be good, remaining in that vast realm of games that are just there, not bad enough to be really called out, but also not good enough to warrant playing. To be fair, I've only played it once, but it's a party game that went way too long wasn't really fun, so I'm not really jumping at the idea of giving it another chance.

* **Lanterns: The Harvest Festival** (4p, 1x) - This one I liked more. While not the best game, it was definetely interesting and looks nice. I'd play it again.

* **4 Gods** (4p, 1x) - I love real time games. I really do. **Galaxy Trucker** (see below), **Captain Sonar** and **Magic Maze** are some of the most fun games I've ever played. So my issue with 4 Gods is not the chaos that comes from a real time game. My issue is that when you combine tile placement and real time, with all people on the same board, you get some unreasonable things, like people getting tiles wrong in sequence - someone places a wrong tile, and someone places a new one on that tile, and so forth -, or even worse, when a wrong tile placed later makes it seem that a legally placed tile is wrong. There's also the issue that, when everyone is trying to place tiles as fast as possible, the whole board tends to get messed up. All in all, **4 Gods** was definetely chaotic and intense, but not really much fun.

* **Bloodborne: The Card Game** (4p, 1x) - Got to give this one another shot, and it went better than the first time, although not without issue. While the first time we had some "balancing" issues - I got a Saw Spear at the start of the game and got so far ahead the game was over with half the monsters yet to be defeated (though there was a LOT of luck involved in that) -, this time my issue was with the game itself. We had Mergo's Wet Nurse as the final boss, and the mechanic that makes everyone restore one point of health every round removed most tension from the game. Aside from one 7-dmg attack from one of the monsters, no one was at any real risk of death at any point.

* **Port Royal** (2p, 1x) - Port Royal is a quite interesting game. It's simple, but also fast, with cool "push your luck" mechanics. It's a fun filler game.

* **Mottainai** (3p, 1x) - I love the art from Mottainai, and the mechanics are interesting, but I didn't have as much fun as I expected on my first playthrough. I'll have to give it another shot, but I get really bothered by games that can end abruptely, without the opportunity for other players to finish their turns.

* **Galaxy Trucker** (2p, 1x) - Every week has to end with Galaxy Trucker, and this one was no exception.

We have a recurring joke in a group: in most games, we start the rules explanation with: "this game is really simple, whoever gets the most points wins".

It's a silly joke, but it's a great way to draw people's attention.
**Terra Mystica**, for sure.
Came here to say this. 

Add to that the fact that you have to openly get a Pretender token to be eligible to win and I think **Inis** is a perfect answer here.
And probably my favorite game ever. I have high expectations for Sidereal Confluence.
What made me pull the trigger on Concordia was when Quinns stopped the Instanbul review to say I should get Concordia.
Not yet, but I really want to. 
Got to play some new stuff this week:

* **Stone Age** (1x, 4p) - Finally got to try this one out. I liked it. It's not my favorite worker placement game (that title probably goes to **Agricola** or **The Gallerist**), but it was a lot of fun. I'd definetely play it again.

* **Five Tribes** (1x, 3p) - Over the last month, my gaming group got Five Tribes to the table at least 10 times, but I had yet to play it. It was a bit overwhelming (this was on Sunday night, and I was absolutely exhausted), but I'm eager to try it again. I liked it, but want to give it another shot to see if I love it.

* **Bärenpark** (1x, 3p) - Bärenpark took the crown for me this week. It has bears, which is great, I absolutely love the art, and it's a tile placement game, which is surefire way of getting my attention. Overall, it was my favorite game of the week, and one I want to have in my collection.

* **Isle of Skye** (1x, 3p) - I have some mixed feelings on this game. I really liked all the mechanics, so it had all the makings of a hit for me, but while I did like the game, I didn't love it, and I can't quite put my finger on why. I'll have to play it some more.

* **Dimension** (1x, 3p) - This was the only game I had already played coming into the week, and it remains an amazing abstract game. I'm always up for playing it.

***

* We don't really coordinate purchases, but we (or at least I) prioritize getting games no one else has or is going to. At the same time, however, we have no issues getting games we really like, even if other people already have it. Everyone in our group has **Agricola** and I'm the only one who doesn't yet have **Terra Mystica** (which I'm planning to get soon).

* I don't really have an amount budgeted for it. I have a "fun" budget, which obviously includes gaming. I do tend to spend at a steady pace, though.

* I got into the hobby not too long ago, so I haven't really sold or traded anything, but I'm considering selling my **Android: Netrunner** Core Set. I got it on impulse, have never actually played with it and don't really plan to.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/6ucxht/how_many_data_scientists_does_it_take_to_defend/

...I kind of get it.
I don't know, I like everything about it, from the deck building to the dungeon, to the freaking dragon attacks. 

Having more options to clean the deck would undermine the clank! mechanic, which IMO is one of the most interesting aspects of the game.
Eh, I love negotiation games and I have a couple of friends that do, too. 

We'll just get it to the table whenever the guys who don't can't make it.
It's far from what my gaming group usually plays, but I had to get it for myself.
Same here. My feelings on the game is that it's taking too long to get to my hands.
I've yet to play **Scythe**, but between **Bloodrage** and **Inis**, I'd get **Inis** every time.

Bloodrage has all the minis and the viking theme (which people tend to like) going for it, but while I did like, Inis, IMO, is by far the better game. 

At its core, Inis is a simple game - draft the cards, then play them in order. First one to end a turn having reached one of the victory conditions with a pretender token wins.

Behind that simplicity, however, there's some real depth - the combination of the card drafting, the pretender token, and the fact that there can be no ties make for some very interesting gameplay, with you having to go for the win and stop others from winning at the same time. I love it.


Ah, that definetely solves the problem. My issue was that there was no consistent way of getting medicine, even if it was less efficient.
Interested!
Alright, this was a good week:

* **Terra Mystica** (1x, 5p) - not much that hasn't been said about **Terra Mystica**. Amazing game, definetely on my top 10.

* **Biblios** (2x, 4p) - what a clever little game. I absolutely loved all about **Biblios**, from the design of the box to the gameplay itself. Fun, fast and smart - all I could want in a filler game.

* **Clank!: a Deck-Building Adventure** (1x, 3p) - **Clank!** was the first modern board game that really clicked with me, about 4 months ago. Now I finally got to play it again, this time with the Sunken Treasures expansion, and it just reinforced my love for it. 

* **Arctic Scavengers** (1x, 4p) - so, I've been wanting to give this a try for a while, now, and must say I was disappointed. I only played it once, so I'm not drawing any conclusions, but my first impressions were not the best. Some time ago, I answered on a reddit post that I didn't mind losing in games, as long as I left the game feeling that if I had done things differently, I could have won - that is, even if there is some luck involved in a game, I believe that the best player should be able to consistently win. That was not my experience with **Arctic Scavengers**. We might have played it wrong, but there were all these cards available to purchase on the table, but all of the best ones required medicine - which could only be found on the Junkyard, which is a pile of cards you draw at random. That is - if you have bad luck and don't find any medicine in the first few turns of the game, you'll most likely lose to someone who does and is able to consistently purchase the best cards. I'm willing to try it again, but it's not really a priority anymore.

* **Carcassonne** (1x, 3p; 1x, 4p) - On the other hand, I also got to play **Carcassonne**, and cross one more classic from my list. I actually really liked it, even if I did get absolutely destroyed on the second time I played.

* **Concordia** (1x, 3p) - The second time I got **Concordia** on the table, and I liked it even more than the first. It is steadily rising on my favorite game rankings.

* **Castles of Burgundy** (1x, 3p) - I had only played ** Castles of Burgundy** with 2 people, and even though I liked it, I feel like it plays much better with 3. An amazing game, even if I'm not that good at it.

* **Galaxy Trucker** (1x, 3p) - no gaming week is complete without **Galaxy Trucker**, which is probably the funniest non-party game I have ever played. Everything goes wrong and everyone loves it.
I think I finally have a collection I'd like to share: http://imgur.com/8mEleLz. It doesn't really follow that much of a pattern - I mostly just fit things where I think they will look good.

I think I have a decent variety on my collection, with varied degrees of complexity and theme, though I want some more short games. 

I've been collecting for just about 4 months, with a steady intake of new games. 

My newest games are **Concordia**, **Agricola** and **Castles of Burgundy**. I've also recently backed **Catacombs: Conquest** on Kickstarter and ordered **Sidereal Confluence**.

I think the one game that might be leaving my collection soon is **Android: Netrunner**. I got it on impulse and never really played it, and don't really feel like it. 

What I'd change about my collection is GETTING MORE GAMES. Seriously, though, there are a few games I really want, but which are pretty hard to get here in Brazil, such as **Chinatown** (which, to be fair, is hard to get anywhere), **Cosmic Encounter** and **Gloomhaven** (which I have no idea if I'll like, but I'm unnaturally drawn to nonetheless).
Better than the current Jets.
Most of the time I'm like this, but there are some games that, with the right group, make me want to go all out. 


**Onitama** and **Takenoko**.
**Concordia**, for sure.
We're 4 episodes into the season and nothing really bad happened to any of the Stark. It's definitely coming.
**Gloomhaven** is the game I have nightmares about. I'm so absolutely drawn to it, but it's so expensive that I can't make myself buy it, especially since I apparently live in freaking Narnia and bringing it here would double it's already high price.
I'll say **Chinatown**, **Puerto Rico** and **Inis**, but this changes pretty much every day.
All sorts of gaming. Video games, board games, role playing games. 

There's so much stuff to try, and so little time.
I really like the art in board games, and absolutely love to see them displayed on the shelves. 

So no, I don't think it's worth it. If I have so many games that I don't have enough room for all of them, I'd rather purge than destroy the boxes.

Think about it: unless you live in a really tiny place, if you have more games than you have room for, odd are some of them aren't really getting played, so you can get rid of those and open up room for new ones.
I personally love **Amerigo**. It has a brilliant mechanic for selecting the available actions and the building mechanics, with its tetris-like tile placement, allows for some interesting player interaction.
I don't know, I've played it for the first time last friday and absolutely loved it.
I'd stay away from **Agricola** for now. It's an amazing game, but I think it's a little too punishing for someone who has never tried Worker Placement. I think **Viticulture** might be a better option for that.
My issue isn't really with the content. It's with him deciding to put it there at the same time a motorcycle chase is happening, with swordfights.
**Snow Crash, by Neal Stephenson**. I overall really liked the book, but I cringed everythime it stopped the action to talk about ancient Sumeria.
> The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed. - The Gunslinger, by Stephen King

A simple line, yet amazingly fitting for the book. 

And a first line discussion can't go without this one:

> In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
I actually subscribe to one of these services because it's a way for me to read things I wouldn't otherwise try.

I tend to gravitate to the same types of books everytime, so the monthly box helps me diversify my reading (every month, they choose a different writer or critic to recommend a book). 

To be honest, I'm way behind on those books, but the ones I read were really good, and I would have never read them if not for that little brown box that comes to my house each month.
3 unplayed games out of 18 (not counting the games I have played, just not my own copy):

* **Concordia** - I have too few games and have been playing way too often for this one to remain unplayed. I'll have to get this to the table this week;

* **Imperial 2030** - actually got this for my birthday about a month ago, and even though it seems to be quite interesting, I can't seem to get it played.
I think she might snap as she begins to lose the war, and decide to blow the whole city up. Jaime would be there, then, to stop her, just as he did with Aerys.
Kind of. 

There are a couple of different storylines, and you'll probably want to start from the beginning of one of them.
I don't really think it was out of character. I think Cersei has been slowly driven insane throughout the series, and she starts seeing enemies everywhere.

I don't think she actually believes that deep down, but anger has always been her reaction to everything bad that happens to her, so when Tommen let her be arrested and humiliated, and when he actually goes and kills himself after Cersei's revenge, she feels betrayed.

She was always cruel, but something has changed in her after her time imprisioned. I think the tendency is for something to happen (maybe Jaime dying, or even betrying her) so that she finally snaps, and starts being seen as someone akin to the Mad King.

Having the Mad King's daughter overthrowing the Mad Queen would be pretty interesting.
While I do like the **Galaxy Trucker** app, I feel like I don't care nearly as much about my ship there as I do on the real game, and that makes it that much less enjoyable for me.
I didn't get because I was afraid it would be too small on a phone screen? It it worth getting it without a tablet?
TBH, I haven't read the article yet, so I'm not arguing for or against its merits, but while a comment on the internet may be forgiven for not expressing clearly its intended tone, an article, as a longer, better structured form of writing, *should* be able to convey it correctly. 

It might happen that someone misinterprets the tone, but an article lacking in tone tends to be a bad article.
Great week, got to play a bunch of new, great games, and replay a few others.

**Agricola** (1x5p) - I feel like I got through a board gaming rite of passage. **Agricola** is one of the classics, and even though I felt I wouldn't really like it, I was eager to give it a shot. And boy, was I wrong. I absolutely love it, and have immediately purchased a copy.

**7 Wonders** (1x5p) - Another one of the classics. I have finally played **7 Wonders**, and I also really liked it. I can see what all the fuss is about.

**The Gallerist** (1x4p) - This one was already one of my favorites, but now that I had a better grasp of the mechanics, I managed to set a real strategy and put it in place. Won by a huge margin.

**The Castles of Burgundy** (1x2p) - Played it for the first time, and it was amazing. Hats off to Stefan Feld for using such a simple mechanic (roll dice, do actions based on your rolls) to create such excruciating decisions. This is not, at all, a pretty game, but it has such an elegant design, and building your province it's such an interesting, satisfying puzzle, that Castles of Burgundy has skyrocket on my rankings as one of my favorite games. 

**El Grande Big Box** (1x3p) - How not to love **El Grande**? It looks great, has interesting mechanics for turn selection, for placing your meeples and scoring, and has a big freaking castle to throw all strategies in a chaotic vortex. I love it.

**Galaxy Trucker** (1x4p) - You can't go wrong with **Galaxy Trucker**. You laugh when you win, and you laugh even more when you lose. I'm always up for a round of it.

**Codenames** (5x7p) - **Codenames** is probably my favorite party game. There are few things like having someone play a couple of rounds trying to guess the words and then try being a spymaster. The look on their faces is more than worth waiting for them to try and find a hind that might work.
I like the tactile appeal of boardgames, as well as being able to get my friends around the table. I feel like social deduction works better when you can look people in the eye.

However, I agree that a lot of games would probably work better as videogames. **Descent**, for example, takes so much work to set up and play that I honestly don't think it's worth it.
I have only played it once, but I liked it. It's a simple, clean, challenging game, that's also short and looks great at the same time.
It depends on what you're looking for:

* **Onitama** is my favorite abstract game. Every game, you'll draw five random cards, which will represent the possible movements the pieces will be allowed to make - the catch is that each player only keeps two of those cards at a time, and every time you use one of them, you swap it for the one left on the board. **Onitama** looks great, it's simple, yet deep, smart, elegant, plays in 15 minutes at most and has a smallish box (not tiny, by any means, but definitely portable). 

* **Twilight Struggle** is a two player game for when you're up for something more complex. It's a game about the cold war, in which each player takes control of one of the super power of the time, as they fight for influence over the globe. It's one of the most intelligent games I've ever played - everything fits perfectly together and with the theme -, and the way it deals with the cards is just genius. If you're up for the challenge, **Twilight Struggle** won't disappoint.

* **Tak**. Another abstract game, **Tak** is beautifully designed, as both players place their tiles trying to make a path from one side of the board to the other, while also stopping their opponents from doing the same. Another case of simple to learn, hard to master, it's a deceptively complex game, and quite a lot of fun.

* **Castles of Burgundy**. I've actually just played **Castles of Burgundy** for the first time today, as a 2 player game, and it was just great. Hats off to Stefan Feld for using such a simple mechanic (roll dice, do actions based on your rolls) to create such excruciating decisions. Opposite to the other games on the list, this is not, at all, a pretty game, but it has such an elegant design, and building your province it's such an interesting, satisfying puzzle, that **Castles of Burgundy** has skyrocket on my rankings as one of my favorite games. Some game designers should be ashamed of the way they use dice on their games while having such genius to use as inspiration.
I've pretty much abandoned all multiplayer video games for the last few months, ever since I got really into board games.

I no longer see any purpose in playing a random match of Overwatch, for example, when I know I could have a much better experience with board games, so nowadays all my gaming has been single player RPGs.

I imagine that with time I'll be able to balance both hobbies, but for now, you'll never see me playing video games when I could be playing board games.
I was gonna pass by your comment, then I saw the username and had to come back and upvote.
I just played it for the first time on friday, and got some tips from the people who knew the game that helped me a lot:

* Always keep in mind that you have to feed your family, so pay attention to when each harvest happens;
* That said, don't leave getting the food for the last possible turn;
* Try to build an engine for food as soon as possible;
* The game is about avoiding point losses just as much as getting more points.
Have you checked Cornwell's Sharpe series?

Conn Iggulden's Emperor series (portraying the life of Julius Caesar) is also amazing. If you liked Cornwell's work, you'll love it.
**American Gods, by Neil Gaiman**.

Literally any of the books from the **Discworld Series, by Terry Pratchett** - I'm particularly fond of **Mort**.
If you like documentaries and football, you might want to take a look at **When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi, by David Maraniss**. 
**Warbreaker**, by Brandon Sanderson.

Before that was **The Emperor's Soul, by Brandon Sanderson** (I've been on a Sanderson streak.

But the recent book that *really* grabbed me from start to finish was **American Gods, by Neil Gaiman**. Nothing I've read recently comes even close.
**The Way of Kings, by Brandon Sanderson**. High expectations for this one.
I'm a really, really curious person, so whenever I play any kind of pure social deduction game I care more about figuring who is playing what role than about winning.
That's the window you're looking for.
**Imperial 2030** and **Concordia** got both of them earlier this month and am eager to play them.

Also want to play my friend's **El Grande**.
I'd take it.
Wow. It's really hard to pick one.

It might be Death, from **Terry Pratchett's Discworld Series**, or maybe Crowley, from **Good Omens, by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman**.

...those are the two that immediately come to mind, but I'm sure I'll think about some really important name later.
TBH, when I played we didn't know this was a thing and everyone left their castles in the center.
But it is a big deal. Hollywood always picks white people for all the generic main character roles, which is an issue by itself, while also aggravating the the problem when they do it with characters that have no reason to be white.

In a perfect world, everyone would be cast to play everything, because race wouldn't make any difference. Since we do not live in a perfect world, casting a white woman to play a Japanese character is an issue.

That's not the reason the movie is awful, but it is a good reason for people to be upset about.
Here's the thing: it's not about intention.

As long as there is a political discussion about representation in culture as a whole, almost every game that portrays people is making a statement, whether they want to or not. At the very least, Istanbul is stating that they do not care enough about the issue of representation to bother putting women on the game, and that's a political message in and of itself. 
The main character (which is supposed to be a japanese woman in japan) is portrayed by Scarlet Johansson.
I think it's easier to picture the issue by thinking about what's considered "normal".

Making an effort to better represent diversity is important because it works towards shifting people's perception about people's "roles" in society.

There's a reason engineers are mostly male and pre-school teachers are mostly female, and it's not due to some genetic affinity  to them - boys and girls are brought up in ways that nudge them towards pre-determined roles. You'll hear people saying that "men are good with logic, women are good with emotions" or some similar bullshit. 

Looking closer at the gaming industry (both digital and tabletop), you'll quickly notice that games are on a vast majority designed and marketed with male consumers in mind. While it might not make women feel they are "unwelcome", it does tend to make them subconsciously believe that it's just "not for them".

I understand that they design and market toward men because the gaming community is (or at least is perceived as) mostly male, but that also tends to push women away from the hobby, in a vicious circle.
I can honestly say that I had never noticed that, and probably would keep not noticing it if no had mentioned it, and I'm a guy that actually cares about theses issues. It makes me think about how much we actually overlook.

Another thing that's interesting is that your wife isn't bothered by it. Could it be because she's actually used to the lack of real representation of women in boardgames?
I absolutely love Puerto Rico, and I'm actually ok with the colonization and slavery theme - that's unfortunately a part of history and I have no issues treating the game as a game.

What does bother me is that they call the brown pieces that represent people who come on a boat and work for free "colonists". If you're going to make a game about colonization, at least own up to it. Don't pretend there it was all nice, and that the "colonists" are anything other than slaves. 

Even as we can (and probably should) be ashamed by some parts of our history, looking away is a disservice to all the people that suffered at the time and still suffer the results of that to this day.
TBH, I'm more bothered by them being called colonists than anything else related to it.

I'm fine with the slavery theme, my issue is with pretending that's not what they are. 
Unfortunately, yes.
Concordia and Imperial 2030 and the expansion for Alchemists.

...though if we want to be precise, even though I have played the games, I've yet to play my own copies of Puerto Rico and Twilight Struggle.
Holy shit.
I mean, I'll take a game having no theme at all - I'm a big fan of abstract games. 

What I have issues with is when the theme is there just so there is one, and the mechanics aren't really related to it. Take dice rolling, for example - I'll take it when the point of the game is being random (**Galaxy Trucker**, **Las Vegas**), but I hate it when I have to depend on it to do something (**Eldritch Horror**).
Oh, I get that. I was mostly being dramatic.

I do have some issues with impulse buying, but I have been working on that for a while now, to a point that while I probably do end up buying more games than I need, I never get something without doing my research and knowing what to expect, and I avoid getting games my friends already own.

Right now, I'm mostly trying to play as many different games as possible, and after trying something over 50, I'm starting to get a feel over what I like the most.

Right now, I feel that the most important thing for me in a game is that the mechanics fit together and, if there's a theme, that they fit together with the theme (I love how the tiles from **Suburbia** interact with each other, and how the possible actions from **The Gallerist** just *click* together).
Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett are my personal favorites. 

Pratchett just might be my favorite author of all time, but I think Adams has the best quotes:

> Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that something so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as a final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.
"The argument goes something like this: 'I refuse to prove that I exist,' says God, 'for proof denies faith, and without faith, I am nothing.' 'But, says Man, the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.' 'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and vanishes in a puff of logic. 'Oh, that was easy,' says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.
> Once you start gaming with a group that starts buying their own games, it becomes less important that everyone owns the same games.

I have issues with impulsive buying (started collecting back in may and purchased 13 games - that's one per week), but the main rule I try to follow is not getting a game that my friends already own (granted, I did break it twice already, for **Onitama** and **Puerto Rico** - but the former is a 2 player abstract game, so it barely counts, and the latter just might be my favorite game, and I got it really cheap).

Even though I love it, there's no reason for me to get **The Gallerist** if the only people I'd play it with already have the game.


I've been collecting since May. I have 15. I think I have a problem.

...I do really like all my games, though. 
It might not be what you're looking for, but have you thought about **Two Rooms and a Boom**?
I giggled when I saw your username.
I sleeve everything, because I'm a complete psycopath. I really really really care about any damage to any piece of the game. 

If I could sleeve the minis, I probably would.

Hell, I would get a glass sheet for the board itself if I had someplace to store it safely.
Is it weird that I love dice in tabletop RPGs and mostly dislike them for boardgaming? 
I'm not necessarily against dice rolling (TBH, I love the action of rolling dice), but I think it depends on how its used.

With all the crazyness going for it, I love the dice rolling in **Galaxy Trucker**, for example. Something is happening, and the dice are used only to decide how or where it happens.

Now what I usually don't like (in boardgames) is when you can just fail a roll and then nothing happens. It may be used as part of the game (Twilight Struggle, which I love, uses dice for coups and realignments), but if that's the game's main mechanic (I'm looking at you, Eldritch Horror), I'm staying clear from it.

That said, I actually quite like dice in RPGs, but that might be because the role playing is actually what I like the most about it, and the possibility of having critical rolls make for some very interesting results.
I don't like how it uses dice, in a way that bad rolls can stop you from doing pretty much anything, and I absolutely hate the "delayed" mechanic, which hampers the game even more.
A friend of mine has been into the hobby for a few years already, so I had already played Catan (liked it) and Eldritch Horror (hated it), but what really got me hooked was a combination of 2 things: 

1. Going to Cool Stuff Inc. and seeing all the possibilities that existed in boardgaming (I live in Brazil, and boardgames are a lot harder to come by); and
2. **Clank!**, which was the first game that actually blew me away (which had been acquired by said friend when we went to CSI).

That was 4 months ago, and I'm now the proud owner of 15 games, the most recent being **Concordia**, and I'm currently looking at getting **Mage Knight** and **Orléans**.
Looking at my shelf, I'd say **Czech Games Edition** and **Matagot**.
It was a slow week, which left me craving for the day I'll get my copy of **Mage Knight** and be able to satisfy my addiction even when my friends are otherwise occupied.

* **Battlestar Galactica** (1x, 5p) - after hearing much about this, while also feeling really skeptic about, I must say that BSG was a pleasant surprise. It was a weird game, to be honest - everything seemed to be going great until we got to the second wave of personality cards (or whatever they're called), which was soon followed by one of the cylon's revealing himself by executing one of us and with the other one following him a couple of turns later (who was our admiral, and decided to nuke our civilian ships). What happened, then, was an intense game of humans vs cylons in the open, ~~with us humans losing at our last jump, from lack of fuel~~ scratch that, just found out you don't draw a card when making the last jump, so you can't lose fuel and therefore we won - hooray. It was *intense*.

* **Sheriff of Nottingham** (1x, 4p) - Sheriff is just great at what it does. It's simple, yet can draw so many emotions from people, ranging from pure delight from getting a bunch of contraband through, to absolute rage at realizing someone just got all that contraband through you, to bursts of laughter from everyone else at the table. You can't go wrong with a game that gets people angry when others tell the truth.

***

1. Well, I guess it'll have to be **Battlestar Galactica**, even if just because it's the only one I've played. It's a good game, though, so I don't feel like it's a bad answer.
2. I'm willing to play with other people, but I'd rather play with my friends. The hard part is drawing more of them into the hobby.
No. If a game seems interesting, the theme is secondary.
I think that's kind of the point of the thread, though. Players that are underrated due to only being watched at the end of their careers, instead of in their prime.
I mean, you probably should not tryhard on a game against a "new player", but I don't think you should deliberately play badly.

You might find someone who wants to learn the game and get better at it, but you should only go easy on someone if both sides are in agreement on that.

I'd rather lose than having someone let me win, and I'd much rather be crushed than still lose when someone is going easy on me.
This is kind of train of thought, but bear with me (or not, I'm just a random dude on the internet).

IMO, boardgames is about having fun with a group of friends, and to do that, everyone should be having fun.

I firmly believe that the amount of fun you can have in a good game is in the game itself, and not in winning or losing. Granted, knowing that you have no chance two turns into the game is annoying, but that's why we say there are heavier or lighter games. If you're not willing to see yourself get behind by suboptimal moves, you shouldn't be playing a game that makes that possible. It's just not going to be fun for you.

So what about the fun of the people who are good at the game?

If someone is letting someone win, or deliberately not playing the best moves, I'd assume they wouldn't really be having much fun, either.

Now, I'm against the experienced player pushing over the new, weak player. I'm not saying you shouldn't punish his mistakes if that is the best move *for you*, but if you're already much better than him, playing optimaly on your side will be enough to win the game without ruining it for him.

On the other hand, I can only speak for myself, but I'd be offended if anyone ever let me win in a game. I don't mind being bad, I mind not being able to play the game as intended.

I believe that fun in boardgames is related to (i) the game; and (ii) the people you are playing with. If you only have one or the other, someone is going to have a bad time. You have to find a game that matches with a specific group, and if you can't find a game that does that, if there is someone that is constantly spoiling the fun for everyone else, it might be time to replace that person (or find a new group yourself).
Most definetely.
If it's a close friend, I can understand it being hard, but if he can't stand losing in Galaxy Trucker, I can't imagine how he would be playing a longer, more serious game.

I mean, the whole point of Galaxy Trucker is that losing is just as funny as winning. 
Elantris was the first one I've read, about a year go, and I absolutely loved it.

I'm planning to get to the second trilogy of mistborn after reading at least Words of Radiance.
Three plays of **Chinatown**, three plays of **Puerto Rico** and three plays of **Inis**, and there goes my Top 3.

Granted, I only got into board games about 3 months ago.

...lots of 3s today.
In **Imperial 2030**, do you also count the nation's power factor when playing the Investor action? Or is that only for end game scoring?
I got the Sawspear and some very lucky rolls, which made for a lot of blood echoes.
I decided to get **Concordia** mainly because of that review.

I usually trust their reviews and the guys made a point of telling you to get it *in another game's review*.

Just started reading **The Way of Kings, by Brandon Sanderson**. 

I recently got on a Sanderson streak. Just on the last 2 weeks, I've read The Well of Ascension, The Hero of Ages, The Emperor's Soul and Warbreaker, and now finally got into the Stormlight Archive. 
This guy was least flexible person ever to play a game of negotiation (for the first 2 or 3 rounds - out of 6 - he made no deals at all, because he always wanted a ton in exchange for almost nothing), and, after no one wanted to deal with him, or tried to get the things he wanted for leverage, he decided to hold what others wanted on purpose - not because he wanted to negotiate it, but because "he might not win, but neither would we". 

It was no surprise when the winner, by far, was the one who didn't have to deal with this guy.
Not too many games this week:

* **Chinatown (5p, 1x)** - This week I found out that even my current favorite game can be ruined when played with the wrong people. 

* **Terra Mystica (4p, 1x)** - I also finally got to play Terra Mystica, and boy, was it worth the wait. An amazing game that I lost miserably, making me want to play again and again and become the very best, like no one ever was.

* **Bloodborne: The Card Game (3p, 1x)** - This was actually the first game I ever bought for myself, but I had never managed to get it to the table. It wasn't great, and by the third monster I was already so far ahead that no one could come close, but I believe that it was more because of luck in specific circumstances than because of a balancing issue. I definetely want to try it again.

* **The Gallerist (3p, 1x)** - The grand winner of the week. The Gallerist is pretty close to being perfect. It's complex, full of interesting decisions, has a great theme and is so, so beautiful. It's a dense, difficult game, that still left me wanting to play again after it ended.
Didn't actually do the motion, imagined the pain nonetheless. 
From my collection, **Codenames**, **Sheriff of Nottingham**, **Mysterium**, **Onitama** and **Tak**. Might even throw a **Captain Sonar** in there.

One I don't have, but absolutely believe would work with non gamers, is **Chinatown**. Barely any rules to learn, just negotiate and try to make more money than everyone else.

I know I would.
I have a hard time thinking that anyone could actually *believe* that was ok.

Calling it a cheap shot is putting it way too mildly. There wasn't even any attempt to pretend that was an accident. Holy shit.
I've looked into **Terraforming Mars**, but it didn't look like something I would like over other options, so I haven't given it much thought, though I'd love to give it a try - even more so now. 

For your question, I haven't been playing for very long (about 3 months, though I have been playing A LOT), but two games that I absolutely fell in love with were **Chinatown** (though it could actually be ruined by a bad kind of player, as I've learned) and **Puerto Rico**. These are the two games I'd be happy to play every single day.
Honestly, I feel like quarterbacking is more of an issue with the players than with the game.

If anything, I'd worry that the game would become less fun for anyone who becomes good enough at it, but that could also be said about a lot of competitive games. 
**Magic Maze** is amazing, but the not talking is built in the game, so it's not a restriction as well as a mechanic itself.

Also, you're all so worried about doing what you need to do and making people do what you thing they should do just by grunting and hammering the big red pawn on the table that you have no time to make conversation.
RPGs mitigate that with the actual roleplaying part of it, which is actually most of the fun. 

Also, that random element makes it so that pretty much anything could happen - sure, you could get your ass kicked by a child, but a critical success could make for extraordinary feats.

IMO, it also makes combat more fun because that is where the GM loses his absolute control over the game (assuming he's not fudging the dice, which I think kind of defeats the purpose of using them at all).

That being said, I'm not a fan of dice in most boardgames. While in RPGs, your purpose is to tell a story, in boardgames, your purpose (usually) is to win, and dice can screw a perfect strategy due to bad luck.

Some games make good use of dice, though, either by mitigating it's randomness (like **Cyclades**), by adding control over the result (like **Twilight Struggle**), by making it so that every roll is useable (like most dice placement games), or by just embracing the randomness of it all (like **Galaxy Trucker** or **Camel Up**).
Have you tried the expansion for **Alchemists**? It actually takes that up a notch by adding some variety to the track itself.
The bidding mechanic is actually what I like the most about **Cyclades**. I love how it can be used both aggressively and defensively through the course of the game.

I also don't really think you can compare it to how **Puerto Rico** does it. Since everyone gets to do all the chosen actions, you're not competing for the role/action as much as working on the perfect timing and bonuses from each choice (which is also my favorite mechanic from that game).
* **Imperial 2030**, because I just got it as a gift and am eager to see how it plays;

* **Alchemists**, because I just got the expansion (though I fell I'll have to get it to the table a few more times before throwing the golem in; and 

* **Puerto Rico**, because it's one of my favorite games and my brother has yet to play it.
Same - played it yesterday for the first time and would have played it right after if we were not pressed for time.

Amazing game.
From all I've seen, **Shut Up and Sit Down** is by far the best at that.

That's actually my reason (with pretty much the exact wording) for pointing out that they are my favorite reviewers whenever anyone asks.
None. I may put off buying games that are too intimidating, but I'm always willing to play different games, even if just once.

As for **Terra Mystica**, it can be pretty punishing when you take suboptimal actions, since it's over in only 6 turns, but if you don't mind losing on your first few (or many) times, I say you should just go for it.

It's an amazing game, and I loved playing it even on my first try, although I did end up frustrated at how I could have played better.
Not yet, but I'm hoping to get it next month.
I rarely play a game more than once on a single week, so this was an odd one:

* **Galaxy Trucker** (2x, 3p and 4p) - After months trying, I finally got to play Galaxy Trucker (twice!), and I liked it just as much as I had expected. This is one of the funniest games I've ever played. I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking for a whole lot of mindless fun - just stay away if you're expecting some kind of deep strategy.

* **Chinatown (2x, 4p and 5p)** - Played it for the first time thursday, and we had to get it back on the table. I love it so, so much. It's so much fun and incredibly accessible - you don't need a deep understanding of mechanics, because there are barely any. You just have to be able to negotiate and jump on good opportunities. It's a 10/10.

* **Puerto Rico (1x, 4p)** - This is one of my favorites, and once again we played it just so I could fall short and get second place for a single point. For the second time in a row.

* **Cyclades (1x, 5p)** - Got it weeks ago and finally got it to the table. Even though we ended up playing it wrong (creatures stayed on the board, instead of leaving on the following turn), I really like it. The auction mechanics make for some very interesting player interactions. I'm excited to play it again, the right way, as soon as possible.

* **Onitama (6x, 2p)** - I'm a big fan of abstract games, and Onitama is my favorite of them. It's simple, yet deep, and amazingly beautiful. I'm always willing to play another round.

* **Sheriff of Nottingham (1x, 5p)** - Played this for the first time, with a group o "non-gamers", and it was even better than I expected. Another box of laughter for all who are willing to bluff and lie with a straight face to their friends. Now I'm wishing for the chance of testing my friendship with someone who actually gets offended by this kind of thing.

My favorite travel game has got to be **Onitama**. 
I know some people who absolutely hate **Dixit**, but I have yet to find someone who doesn't like **Codenames**.
I have **Bloodborne: the Card Game** and **Cyclades** unplayed, but that's because I usually only get to play 2 or 3 games a week, everyone has stuff they want to play and I don't get to take my games when we meet on weekdays, since I usually go straight from work.
**Twilight Struggle**
/u/boardgamerecommender jpnovello
It's hard to pick one, but I think my personal favorite is Shut Up and Sit Down Season 2, Episode 4, in which they review some mage related games: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtCzsCMYnCE
It depends. There are some **Mysterium** cards that I would most definetely hang on my walls, if I could get a hold of them in larger sizes.

I'll grant, though, that I wouldn't usually hang traditional board game art on my walls, unless it was on a room set aside specifically for gaming (which I don't have).
But it kind of defeats the purpose, don't you think?

I mean, I could just list Codenames, Cards Against Humanity, Onitama, Tak and Joking Hazard, just to name a few I play regularly (quick, 2 player games or those I play with ""non-gamers""), but that wouldn't be much of a challenge.
TIL 10x10 is a thing.

I also figure that I won't be able to do it by the end of the year.

I don't think I have a single heavier (as in not-party) game I've played over 3 times this year.

There's so much new stuff to try.
I know a guy who knows a guy that knows a guy.

In time, everyone got to know everyone and I got myself a gaming group. 
Yeah. And it's not like board games are small enough that I can ask people to bring me whenever they travel abroad.
**Mysterium**. I'll keep it forever even if I almost never get to play it, just because of how great it looks.
Yeah, I'm constantly considering it, but living in Brazil, making a bet on a USD120 game is a big leap of faith. We have a whopping 60% tax on imported games, so the game would actually cost about USD200 + shipping (which would cost at least another USD50). 
**Food Chain Magnate** is currently one of my favorite games, so much that I feel tempted to get it even though we already have a copy in our gaming group.

**Goomhaven** is one I really wanted to get, but it's hard to justify the price tag, since I'm skeptical regarding how many of the 95 scenarios I'll actually get to play. I'm not sure how well my group will take it.
**Mysterium** was kind of divisive among my group. I liked it (not amazing, but a lot of fun if played with the right people), a friend of mine *loved* it and two others hated it.

While those who liked it loved the crazyness of the game, those who didn't hated how there is no strategy involved, but mostly guessing.

I believe it depends on how seriously you're going to take the game. For **Mysterium**, the answer should be not at all.
Preferably kept at a side table. 
I started answering this thinking that I'd probably keep all of my collection forever (it's still small, and I research quite a bit before buying anything new), but I guess storage could become an issue, so I guess that's not really true.

So my answer is **Onitama**. It's on my top 5 favorite games, doesn't take much space, can be taught in like 2 minutes and was one of the first games I ever played (so it has a lot of sentimental value).

I can't see myself getting rid of it on less than extreme circumstances.
It is very much worth it.
I was thinking about that as I wrote this, but the one who made the combo was the owner of the game and the one who told us the rules. We just went with it. I'm willing to give it another chance, then.
This was a great week, got to play a lot of new, awesome games.

* **Seasons (3p)** - Starting with the disappointment from the week. Everything was going fine until the last of the 3 years the game is played in. I already knew I was going to lose, but I had made peace with it, but then, halfway through the last year, one of the players combined two cards to run the counter forward and immediately end the game, without anyone being able to do anything about it. I was pissed. I find it hard to think of a single type of mechanic that I hate more than those that stop people from playing. The game should *at the very least* allow everyone to finish their turn before ending. I don't think I will play it again anytime soon.

* **Suburbia (4p)** - Now this was just such a nice game. I just love the building aspect of it, with the competition for the same objectives and tiles making for some interesting decisions throughout the game. Still, it's simple enough to make it a good gateway game. 

* **Puerto Rico (4p)** - After weeks having a friend of mine talking about it, I finally got to play Puerto Rico. And it did not disappoint. I absolutely love everything about it. It's just a solid game, with smart mechanics and interesting decisions leading to amazing moments. 10/10.

* **Twilight Struggle (2p)** - Another one to skyrocket though my rankings. After playing it a single time, Twilight Struggle is already one of my favorite games. The theme is great, the mechanics work in very interesting ways, which are also perfectly connected to each other and to the theme (having the score be a tug of war is just genius). I can't think of anything I didn't like about it (and I got crushed, with the USSR winning the war at about 1965). 

* **Alchemists (4p and 2p)** - I got my eyes on Alchemists just last week, and it seemed so crazy, so interesting and so *fun* that I had to get it for myself. The first time we played (4p), it was just insane, and the debunking of theories was some of the funniest moments I ever had in gaming. The second time (2p), the game was a lot more strategic - against all odds, there was actually no debunking to be done, as both of us actually got all our theories right on our first try, even those we weren't quite sure about. All in all, it was a great purchase, and I know I'll get quite a few plays out of it.

* **Splendor (3p)** - Another classic I got to play this week. Splendor is just smart. You can't get much simpler than that, but that gives it an edge as everyone is trying to get the needed cards to be able to afford more cards to get the points they need, while also stopping anyone from getting the other the cards and points they need. I really, really liked it.

* **Kingdomino (4p)** - A nice little game, with simple but interesting mechanics. Taking just about 15 minutes to play, it is a perfect filler game.

* **Amerigo (4p)** - Another great game. The idea of using the tower to decide which actions can be performed each turn is great, and it makes for some very interesting decisions. It's an incredibly clever game, with room for intelligent, cutthroat interaction between the players.

* **Notre Dame (5p)** - Notre Dame is great. I loved the way you have to kind of make sure you do a bit of everything, or risk getting overrun. You can't just focus on getting VPs, because you risk getting overrun by the plague, and you can't just focus on stopping the plague, because you risk falling behind on the VPs, and you must do all that while also getting enough money to do what you need to do and cubes (or workers) to keep your game going. My only issue with it is the lack of interaction between players and how hard it is to come back after a rough start - you just won't be able to catch up unless someone else screws up. However, that does not take away the merits from this game, which would probably be my favorite from any other week. 

As for the questions:

* I just got into the hobby recently, so I still have *a lot* to learn, but it helps that I have quite a few friends that have been down this rabbit hole for years. This way, what I usually do is watch one (it Shut Up and Sit Down has one) or two (if they don't) reviews, check Reddit for opinions and then go ask friends who have played the game. My favorite reviewers are, by far, the guys from Shut Up and Sit Down. While they don't really cover all the rules and mechanics in detail, they are great at showing how a game feels like, while also being incredibly funny. They haven't disappointed me yet.

* I wouldn't pick any game. No matter how much I like a game, I like variety more than anything. I'll always choose playing a new game before replaying an old one, no matter how much I like it (unless the new one seems bad, but I'll even play the seemingly bad ones if they're well recommended).

Dice rolling is what put me off from Dark Souls, even though I love the video game series.

The whole concept of dice rolling for combat goes against everything the series represents.
Sure! My personal collection has only about 8 games, but me and my friends make sure we always get different ones so we can play as many as possible.

Check out my collection at BGG: https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/jpnovello
So, I already got **Inis** (and it is probably my favorite game in my collection), but I'm really tempted to get **Cyclades**. Is it too similar? 

From what I've seen, they do seem pretty different, but It's hard to grasp how a game feels without actually playing it. My collection is still small, so I could only justify getting it if there are significant differences between them.

Also, for a complete change of pace from anything I'm used to, I caught my eyes on **Alchemists**. It seem amazingly weird, but also amazingly fun, and I feel like it would be a perfect fit for some of my friends. The only issue I see is about replayability. Should I be worried that I might never get more than 10 plays of this, ever? Should I get it anyway? TBH, there's so many different games out there that I can only think of a couple of games I've played over 10 times.

Also, how does it play with 2 people?

I once played a game of **Inis** that went for over 3 hours, just from people making sure not to let anyone else win, ever.
After months, I've finally finished **Snow Crash, by Neal Stephenson**. 

I liked it, but there were some serious issues with the pacing - I find it hard to accept him stopping the action (which is amazing) to explain the hackers from ancient Sumeria. There had to be a better way of explaining the whole concept without having a literal librarian throwing exposition at me.

So now I'm finally reading **American Gods, by Neil Gaiman**, which I'm loving so far.
Do it. Discworld is at the same time so insanely ridiculous and so amazingly clever.

Sir Terry makes use of the absurd to satirize real life, and trust me when I say he is the best at it.
Shit, man. I'm so sorry for you.
As long as they don't dumb down the actual monste hunting and they keep variety between weapons, I'm up for it. 

From what I saw, it's not so much an open world as opposed to having seemless transitions between maps. The tracking and stealth mechanics also look interesting.

I'm actually pretty excited for it.
Snow Crash is currently taking me forever to read. It's been months and I'm having a really hard time picking it up and reading it.

What's really weird is that I actually like the book. I *love* all the little ideas on it, the characters are interesting and I'm actually curious about what is going to happen.

I can't really pinpoint it, but I think there's something about the writing that's slowing me to a halt.

The big problem here is that I'm focused on finishing it and can't really read 2 books at the same time, so I'm kind of stuck.
If you ask Brady, he is going to retire long after Rodgers.
Can't talk about everyone, but I don't get mad about it, just really, really sad.

I don't think any amount of victories will ever make me not feel for that one, except *maybe* beating Eli on the SB - but I don't believe we'll ever get another chance.
**Inis.** Easily.

It just works, and it's just so much fun.
Fuck this game.
432 - I'm in Brazil, so I'll definetely pay for shipping.
Getting all 6 of us together is really rare, so it's not much of an issue. Is the base game enough to play with only 5 people?

Mage Knight would be mostly for me, TBH. 
Ok, I'm kind of new to the hobby, looking for a new game and am not quite sure what to go for.

I'm currently looking at **Scythe** and **Mage Knight**, but I'm willing to hear any suggestions. 

**Number of Players:** from 1 to 6. I've got some friends I play with, but there is no real number consistency. Some weeks we can't get together at all, some weeks we have all 6.

**Game Length:** I'm looking for something more complex, so I'd say at least an hour.

**Complexity of Game:** See above, I want a game that demands thinking.

**Your Budget:** Budget is not so much of a problem as availability. I'm in Brazil, so some stuff are *hard* to get, and importing taxes can make the price of a game skyrocket. If it's something I *really* want, though, I can make an effort to go after it.

**Themes/Mechanics:** Honestly, I'm up for anything, but I love having cards switching things up through the game, I like miniatures, I like strategy. Dice are interesting, but only when they're not simply stopping you from doing things (I'm looking at you, **Eldritch Horror**) - some randomness is nice, losing a turn because you rolled badly is bad.

**Competitive or Cooperative:** Both work. More than anything, I want an interesting challenge.

**Games I Own/Like or Dislike:** My favorite games today are probably **Inis**, **Clank!**, **Food Chain Magnate** and **Captain Sonar**. As above, I really dislike **Eldritch Horror**.

**Preferred Market:** As said above, I'm in Brazil, so things are harder to come by, but you'll never know when you might find someone selling their stuff online.
TBH, there was no gateway game. 

I had played a couple of games with some friends, but while interested, I wasn't yet totally into the hobby.

What actually got me hooked was going with my friend to Cool Stuff Inc in Maitland. I saw all those games, all the possibilities, and didn't dive as much as plummeted into the rabbit hole.

That day, I got **Captain Sonar**, **Tak** and **Bloodborne: The Card Game**, and proceeded to buy **Onitama** later that week. 

To give a better answer to OP's question, the first game that I played and actually fell in love with was **Clank!**.
I always do some sort of research, even if it's just a quick look on my phone before getting the game.
This was a great week. Granted, I just got into the hobby a couple of months ago, so I haven't played that many different games in my life, but I just got to play two games that are easily in my Top 5.

**Food Chain Magnate.** 4P - What a beautiful, amazing game. Things can swing amazingly fast and whenever something happens, there is no one to blame. Everything is in the open and by the time everyone is done with their turns, you just watch as everything develops. I absolutely love it. 

**Inis.** 2P and 3P - This is definetely my favorite game in my collection and just might be my favorite game ever. It is a simple game, but every mechanic works and fits perfectly with the theme, making for a really involving experience. The only issue I had with it is that the manual is sized in a way that it can't rest perfectly in the box, so that should say a lot about the game.

**Mexica.** 3P - Mexica is an interesting game. The pieces are beautiful and the mechanics are nice, but while I did like the game, I don't feel like playing it again in the near future. I'll opt for playing something new whenever I can, and if I *must* repeat, I'll most likely go with something else.
That's the PS4 home screen.
Holy shit, dude.
"Yeah, I don't really get this instaface thing. The players just got to do their job. We're here to win football games."
Alright, this week I played:

* **Santorini** Even though I knew it existed, I had never tried it out before. We played it with 3 people, and even though it's a great game, I feel like it would work better with only 2.

* **Viticulture** What a beautiful game. I lost by *a lot* and still loved it to death. I will definetely try to play it again soon.

* **Steampunk Rally** It's ok. I mean, it's a fun game, but not amazing. It was actually a bit underwhelming. I love the theme, and the mechanics are interesting, but I felt like *someone* should have exploded on our first shot at the game. 
> Yes, apps can do this and more, but personally doing it myself keeps me much more in tune with where i am financially.

That's exatcly where I'm coming from. I was using YNAB since recently, but decided that (i) I didn't want to pay the monthly fee; and (ii) I could get much more done on a spreadsheet, with the added benefit of having complete control of what happens. 

I think I'll just start small with tracking expenses, so I have something to build up on. It should be easier than trying to plan too far ahead. 
As far as I can tell, you get it like 3 days earlier, plus some stuff at UT. Nothing I really care about. 
I was thinking of having a sheet for each month, one for a yearly summary and one with something like a present-day overview, but I might spread it out further to keep things more cleanly organized.
Dude, there's a G.O.A.T. edition. I'm definetely throwing my money at this.
If I ever randomly find any, I'll make sure to get them.
...shit.
TIL there's a Discworld game.

Today I also learned it's so expensive I'll most likely never get it.

Today is a sad day.
I would love to give it a try. I just find it hard to go on a leap of faith for a $50 game most reviews make me believe I won't like.
Yes. Yes, it is.
Yeah, it's already available for preorder on Amazon. Living in Brazil, though, it will not be easy getting my hands on that one. 
I only heard of it earlier today and will now have to try my best to get it elsewhere.
I'm glad I didn't buy **T.I.M.E. Stories**. 

I randomly saw it on the shelves in 4 different stores over the course of a week, and after falling absolutely in love with the design, almost got it just because of that.

Later I decided to do some research, read some reviews and was glad I resisted my urge to buy it.
Treating people who are serving you as people.
KotOR is definitely on the top 10.
My main issue with No Man's Sky was how boring flying the ship felt (which is kind of why I now play Elite).
...bad day?
Honestly, after the SB, I'm never, ever, doubting a Pats victory again, no matter the odds.

...which is probably going to make me suffer on the long run, but I'll enjoy it while it lasts.
I love this man.
After 2014, I remember reading this one story that started and ended with "The Patriots are the Super Bowl champions" and I couldn't believe it (I'm not from the US and only got into football in 2007, when I was obviously drawn to the Patriots, so I had witnessed two near misses, but no Patriots Super Bowls yet). 

After the rough start, and "on to Cincinnati", I never thought it could get any better than that, but oh, boy, was I proven wrong.

I'm still waiting for someone to try and bring up some excuse for how we must have cheated to get back from 28-3, but the truth is that SB LI was such a show of force that they can't deny it anymore.

I love this game and I love this team.
Shepard is such a beast.
I felt really bad that week, but it had to be done.
Every time.
Pratchett is probably my favorite author ever. Adams is pretty close.
Go read that, and if you like it (you should), go read Terry Pratchett. 
That is very fair.
Note that I'm not actually saying you should get your armies and march through Chechnya to free those men - I won't pretend I know the full political dynamics involved and I do understand that things are never that simple.

What I do believe is worth mentioning is that this is pretty much the kind of thinking that let the nazi get as far as they did. People kept believing it was not their problem and by the time it was over, millions of people were dead.
“It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see..."

"You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?"

"No," said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, "nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people."

"Odd," said Arthur, "I thought you said it was a democracy."

"I did," said Ford. "It is."

"So," said Arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse, "why don't people get rid of the lizards?"

"It honestly doesn't occur to them," said Ford. "They've all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they've voted in more or less approximates to the government they want."

"You mean they actually vote for the lizards?"

"Oh yes," said Ford with a shrug, "of course."

"But," said Arthur, going for the big one again, "why?"

"Because if they didn't vote for a lizard," said Ford, "the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?"

"What?"

"I said," said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, "have you got any gin?"

"I'll look. Tell me about the lizards."

Ford shrugged again.
"Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happenned to them," he said. "They're completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone's got to say it."

"But that's terrible," said Arthur.

"Listen, bud," said Ford, "if I had one Altairian dollar for every time I heard one bit of the Universe look at another bit of the Universe and say 'That's terrible' I wouldn't be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin.”

Getting to Andromeda was REALLY weird because I didn't know what to do. By the time I ended ME3, I instinctly knew how my Shepard would react on any given circumstance.

Now Ryder? I have absolutely no idea.

Which is kind of weird, since I'm the one making the choices, but it never really felt like that.
I love this so much.
LETS GO
It's the only trophy that felt absolutely pointless to me.

...and it's also the only one that's not marked on the map.
I'd break up with someone for that.
The baptism scene in the first Godfather movie.

"Do you renounce satan and all his works"

"I do."

*Cuts to people being killed on his orders.*

One of my favorite scenes in movie history.
The thing that brought me to the XPS series is the portability (I was actually looking for the i7, non-touch version, but I could only find them on the dell store). That one is a bit on the heavy side at almost 6 pounds.

Do you know how it is battery-wise?
I'm planning to check Best Buy out, but since I'll only be there for about 10 days, I'm trying not to risk it.
Photoshop, some gaming for when I'm on the go (Overwatch, Elite Dangerous), but It'll be used mostly for work, which is basically MS Office.
I got really lucky and got it in about an hour. That's probably the only reason I had no issues with the DeS plat.
It also makes absolutely no sense that you have to carry your gear around at all times, but can't change it on the fly.
I've played ME so many times that I instinctly know how I want my Shepard to be like on each playthrough.

Ryder is a whole new character, I have no idea what I want her personality to be like.

So far, I'm going with playful/eager for adventure.
I failed badly and went to bed at about 5am. Not a great idea.
I've stayed up way too late playing yesterday, now I need to slog through work for about 8 more hours before heading home.
TBH, I haven't played in months, and I'm still getting a VR set just so I can fly a ship through space.
Denying anyone their rights is a way of possibly starting something no one wants. At least to me, there are few things as terrifying as a State that can choose when it follows the rules.

That's where dictatorships lie. The world has seen plenty and it is never pretty.
I took the ratio idea as an example, not as an actual ratio, but I am more inclined than most in favor of it, since I'm mostly against the prisonal system as a whole.

I believe the point is that it is more importat, as a whole, to guarantee the basic rights of *all* than guaranteeing that people are arrested.

"Justice" is enforced by humans that, by definition, make mistakes. In criminal cases, such mistakes result in the ruining of an inocent man's life as well as letting the real culprit go free, all for what? So that the victim, or maybe the victim's family, can have their revenge?

That's just not good enough for me.

But then again, I do agree that it *is* just my opinion. There's no right answer when you're putting subjective values on a scale.
That's correct. The ruling was just so that he wouldn't stay arrested before the trial was over.
It is, however, the opinion upon which most democratic states are based upon.
That's exactly right. If the court rules against his appeal (which is what's most likely to hapen), he'll be sent back to jail. 
And who choses who has, or not, access to the judiciary? How do you guarantee someone is, or not, corrupt. 

The whole point is that it is more important to safeguard the rights of people wrongfully arrested than arresting guilty people.

And Bruno was arrested when he was at the best point in his career.  His position at a tiny team people only know because they hired him is not going to give him more influence than he had before.

Besides, both Marcelo Odebrecht and Eike Batista, as well as some other people among the richest and most influent in Brazil, are currently under arrest and have been for months. I don't think Bruno will ever have any more power than they do.
Here's the thing. 

If he was, for any reason, proven innocent (granted, I don't think anyone believes he will be), he would have spent over 7 years wrongly imprisoned. 

The law was made this way with a thinking that keeping guilty people arrested is less important that keeping innocent people out of jail.

The "technicalities" exist in order to protect the weakest parties. If you break proper procedure and stop following them when things seem obvious, you create bad precedents and open space to make them not be followed in other cases, which can be *bad*.

Breaking procedure because of apparent injustice actually just opens the way for more injustice. 
I tried really, really hard not to get caught on it, but it was way too strong for me. Now I'm just trying to get ready for disappointment.
That's pretty good. 

TL;DR is that in Brazil you can only be lawfully arrested, in a definitive manner, after all possible appeals have gone through. Bruno had been arrested in a preventive manner for 7 years, which is WAY longer than what is allowed by law. You would be right to blame the slow judiciary system in Brazil, but his release was the correct decision.
Only if you have Origin Access, which is not available here :(
> There isn't much that can be done that hasn't already been done elsewhere, due to the basic tropes and races.

But that's kind of the point. There is an unlimited amount of things that haven't been done yet, but people insist on keeping to the same tropes and races.

You could create literally anything in a fantasy genre, but every single "new" setting has orcs, elves and dwarves in a pseudo-medieval world. 
I'm still fucking terrified.
I'm playing on PC and there's still no early access for me because EA doesn't think Brazil is a good enough for them.
I've spent the last few years working on not getting too hyped for anything, but Andromeda threw all that away, and now I'm terrified it will suck and I'll spend a week crying in my room, be fired from my job and end up living in the streets.
I'm officialy terrified.
Definetely, but it's really, really hard for me to fight the urge of doing everything.

I just finished Horizon: Zero Dawn, and they solved this problem by calling the fetch quests and such "Errands" and the relevant ones as "Side Quests", so by the end I was just ignoring all the errands. It also helped that even at max level the enemies could still kill you if you got too cocky.
I just want to meet the new characters and see how it goes.

I'll play as Sara and do what I think feels right at the time (which usually ends up being a "hero" kind of character), but I try not to plan anything ahead of time on my first playthrough.
This is my issue with most open world games. I try to do EVERYTHING before moving on, and up getting (i) burned out; and (ii) way overleveled, making everything too easy.
If the Reapers arrive in the ending I'll catch a plane and personally demand my money back, South Park style.
I actually really liked the game in the beta, but no one else I knew was willing to buy it, since everyone was getting overwatch.

It's a shame, really.
Seven? I want all of them.
That would be the best thing ever, except the *worst* thing ever would be getting there 18-0 and losing to the Giants again, so I'd rather not risk it, thank you very much.
Easiest way I found to beat him was with an arcane build. He gets staggered by my evil skulls of death and gets hit by my evil hammer of smashing.
Money per hour is what makes companies create hundreds of irrelevant, generic fetch quests instead of a few decent ones.
When I watched it they even turned the lights off when the credits were over, just to mess with people when nothing happened.
I hate when games do that. If I'm supposed to lose the fight, don't make me win it before you tell me that.

In ME1 there was an option for that, too. Not sure about ME2.
To be honest, I was pretty tired of Wolverine as a character. The only reason I decided to watch Logan was its 93% rotten tomatoes score and a couple of really persistent friends.

But I'm glad I did. Logan is a really refreshing take on the humanity behind ~~wolverine~~ Logan and a great take on the idea of age and death as a whole.

I did have some issues with it, but it's a great movie nonetheless.
With a boss like OoK, I actually found it easier to do it solo. Adding a second person on the fight makes the boss less predictable.
Wait, saga? There are more books besides shogun? How did I never know this?

Excuse me as I go buy them.
I love you so much.
All I need is a decent story and characters and a combat system that works.


3, on 2 redraft leagues and one dinasty, though I'll probably quit one of the redraft leagues and either replace it for another (maybe with a different ruleset) or just stick to the 2 left.


I couldn't really adapt to the whole YNAB thing. I ended up using it just for tracking my expenses (which, to be honest, was something that definetely needed doing), but now that I got that habit down I'm switching to a more traditional - and free - method, on an excel spreadsheet, which gives me more freedom to decide what I want and need on my financial planning.
> define same general area

"Europe"
Holy shit man what has he ever done to you?
TBH, that was pretty much my reaction as well. 

I had such a hard time actually believing they had done it that I only started celebrating after I saw the confetti.
I think most people just overcompensate for the whole "Patriots only win because they cheat" thing.

Instead of arguing that the Patriots win because they're the best team, they argue that they never cheated, or broke the rules, or swore, or failed to go to church on sundays.
TBH, I think the Super Bowl will actually make all that worse.

The big issue with the whole cheating thing is how people use it to say the Patriots' victories are "tainted".

It's not about semantics, it's about how people imply the 15 year dominance by the Patriots is caused by some unfair advantage they had, instead of the players work and competence.

Seriously, you have no idea of how much the deflategate bullshit bothered me. With all due respect, the colts were trampled all the way through that game, and people come and say the title is "tainted" because they allegedly deflated the footballs?  

I have just watched the most amazing game of my life and it still pissed me off just like before.
Because trades start happening right now, involving both players and picks in the rookie draft.
I love this man so fucking much.
Honestly, as much as I would love to beat the Giants on a Super Bowl, I don't think the chance of getting rid of that fucking now 5-Giants score bullshit could ever make up for the risk we might lose.
I would have straight up died after Tom's interception.
I watch it at least once a year. I planned on watching it before the game, too, but I had some work to do and couldn't.

Will definetely watch it this week, though.
Yep. And then I saw him raising that trophy and this little voice started talking in my head: "one more".
Fair enough, I'll give you that.
Just like Kearse's, I'm very glad it wasn't :)
I wasn't even mad (maybe a little) over Julio's catch last night. 

It was such a perfect play that I had nothing to complain about.

Tyree's was bullshit. Dishonor on him, dishonor on his family, dishonor on his cow.
It wasn't the same. Tyree, Manningham and Kearse's catches had a lot of luck involved.

When Kearse got that ball 2 years ago I couldn't believe it had happened again.

Julio's, however, was just an amazing display of skill and athleticism. It was a perfect play.
While I do agree that Julio's catch was, without any doubts, the best catch of the night on an athletic level, Edelman's, while absolutely helped by luck, needed some crazy concentration and determination too.

I mean, the ball didn't fall to him, he jumped on it and grabbed it in the split second before it hit the ground. That was an amazing play.
You know what his favorite ring is? The next one.
I was pretty fucking close of having a heart attack last night, this was the most amazing thing ever.

However, now thats it's finished, there's one single thing on my mind.

ONE MORE. ON TO THE SIXTH, PEOPLE.

THEY EXPECT TB TO PLAY 3 MORE YEARS, LET'S TURN THOSE INTO 3 NEW RINGS. 

LETS GO.
Quite a few, actually. :)
LETS GO.
Eh, why not.
That's some pretty irresponsible thinking, right there.
Everything I hang is framed, but that's not really the point. People in my office are very conservative.
I'm not saying it's reasonable, nor that it happens everywhere. I'm talking about my personal experience, in my office. 
I wouldn't put a video game related poster in my office because I don't feel like explaining and seeing the looks of disapproval every time someone sees it.

I mean, no one I care about would actually think less of me because of it, but they would definetely think it's childish and/or not appropriate for a work environment.
I've just started out and am still playing with my DS4, but I can't wait until I get my Hotas and VR headset in april. I'm sure it's going to be amazing.
My biggest issue is how I am used to the mechanics in the later games and keep getting killed because I can't roll in the exact direction I want to.
I'll look it up
I used to play WoW religiously, then LoL, then a shit ton of other MMOs.

Recently, though, I've been extremely busy with work, so I made a conscious decision of playing through games, so I can enjoy as many different games as possible, instead of sticking to the same few ones.
Harry Potter. I've read all of them several times and loved each word, but I'm not sure I'd be able to get by all its flaws if I had first read it today.
Was searching for it as I went down. Every year or so, I'll rewatch Buffy and Angel.
My league has 4 divisions mostly to create rivalry and discord.

It works wonders. I love it.
It's amazing. Really.

The demo almost scared me off, but they made it much better on release.
I got the game on release, but couldn't play much because of travelling for work. And tomorrow I'm taking the plane again, so no more FFXV again, at least until the weekend.
It looks great! I've been meaning to get a bonfire tatooed for quite a while already. I love how it represents both a place of rest and a way to rise to new challenges (with all enemies respawning and all).
I was going strong at the start of the year, thinking I'd breeze through my 30 books challenge.

...It's almost December and I'm still at 20, and that's only because I'm counting graphic novels (which I usually don't).
It might. The greatest sin from Fallout 4 was that it subverted what the series was really about. If you go there expecting nothing, you should have a great time.

I mean, we waited for 5 years for a new Fallout, after the masterpieces FO3 and NV, and got FO4. I actually enjoyed the game, but it doesn't even come close.
KotOR is just amazing.
Those are some *old* people.
Hi there! It looks like you're trying to submit a question related to the US election. We currently have a breaking news thread for questions like this here.
Something similar happened to me last night, also on emperor.

Japan decided to forward settle and then send a bunch of missionaries to convert my cities, promised not to do it and kept doing it. So I started a war against them, took their city and accepted the peace offer.

...which made them send more missionaries and made me start another war and take another city.

...which was followed by another wave of missionaries.

What the fuck, japan. 

At least now Gorgo loves me.
I'll probably go for the deluxe, definetely staying away from "super deluxe".
I want Quarians so much.
This video gets me every time.
Same. Nothing so far...
Came here to say this. Thank you for saving me the trouble.
I had never played any other Civ game extensively (I did play a bit of Civ II and Civ V) and I'm having a lot o fun right now. Some mechanics may be a bit confusing, but overall, the base game is easy enough to learn.
I'm having a hard time answering this without offending you or your family.
Skyward Sword is the best.
I have an uncontrollable urge to contest anything I think doesn't make sense in a game (it doesn't help that my brother is the DM), but I realize it breaks the game and have been making an effort to at least just state my disagreement and, if necessary, argue my point after it's over.
I never said Apple was evil or that I don't like their products. At the same time I'm switching to android, I'm getting a Macbook.

But it really bothers me that they have this business practice of kind of "forcing" you to have everything from Apple. Worst of all, they sell it like it's a good thing. In a world of interactivity, they require you to have an Apple thingy for you to be able to use any non-Apple device with their products.

It's not that I don't understand or that I think they are "evil". It just pisses me off.
I'm not sure, but I never had any issues with it.
I'm holding him for a while, just in case. No RBs on waivers and I'm 3-1 with a pretty solid team, so it's worth a shot.
Personally, I've always loved how the iPhone (and all Apple products, really) is ready to go as soon as I get it out of the box. I feel like the iPhone is perfect for people (such as me) who didn't really want to bother setting everything up to be exactly as you wanted, but still wanted a great phone.

Nevertheless, Apple's recent moves have really bothered me. The thing with the headphone port is not really about needing it. It's about Apple going further and further down into not being compatible with anything else. In a world of connectivity, Apple insists on making you need an adaptor for everyhing and that pisses me off. 

So I'm getting a Galaxy S7 Edge in a couple of weeks, just so I can make a final decision on whether Android is for me (I'd go all out and get a Pixel, but our options are pretty restricted here and I need a new phone ASAP).
Hate is a strong word, but I had some issues with the first few episodes of the show. I thought they were just silly and kept using Steven's childish nature as a way to make havoc. Back then, what kept me going was the worldbuilding behind it all.

After watching everything again, I could see how they made it so that every detail mattered and I really liked them all. They're still down on my list of best episodes, but only because the show gets so amazing later on.
I feel like even though the Council was bad for Shepard, saving them was what was best for the galaxy in the long run.
I figured the council might be grateful after being saved from certain death.

I should have known better.

...still, I've never felt the need for putting humanity ahead of other races. I'd rather unite everyone against the reaper menace and saving the council seemed like a good move.
Because I'm the best goddamn specter in the galaxy and I'd kill Sovereign myself if I had to.

The thought process involved getting the council on my side after I had wiped the floor with Saren. Also, it'd be easier to fight the geth before they had destroyed all the other ships. 
Gameplay-wise, ME1 is lacking, but everything else more than makes up for it.

Shepard's first speech as captain of the Normandy, your induction as a Specter and at the end, when you call the human fleet to save the Ascension... That game is a masterpiece.
.............it was in the wrong port. Thanks, I'll see myself out now.
...............................................I sure hope so. I'm feeling stupid right now and since I'm at work, I can't even go check it. Damn.
I'm switching from iPhone and I can't even get a Nexus in Brazil. Samsung it is.
Same in Brazil. The iPhone 6s is about 300 dollars more expensive than the Galaxy S7 edge.
Yeah, I've decided to go with 10. Less to worry about now and I won't have to bother upgrading later.
Both music and apps, actually. Not so much video. 

I'll do some research.
TBH, I'm not sure of what I *need*. What I *want* is to be able to do everything on my phone. 

I don't want to see myself regretting getting one or another phone just because I didn't know there was something else I could have had that my phone doesn't do.

I definetely don't need the best camera around, but I do want as good a battery life as possible, ability to multitask and enough storage space that I don't have to be afraid of running out (I had 64gb on my iPhone and it was definetely not enough).

I also don't want a phone with a huge screen. I'd like something reasonable.
My plan is to get any recommendations and try the phones out at a store. I'll check the HTC 10 out.
Then again, we can't really know how the other gems felt like back then. Bismuth had been bubbled for thousands of years.
Holy shit, that's a lot of bosses.
I killed Amygdala with the canon. Went pretty well. 

Now watchdog was intense. Had to be perfect to do it.
Seems interesting. I'll give it a shot
I'll check them out. Thanks!
I'm searching for books about japanese mythology. Want to learn more about it and, since I don't know anything, I wanted something better structured than going through a wiki somewhere.
My thoughts exactly.
"Why?"
Awesome. Thanks!
I'm finally making enough money to build a decent gaming PC. I'd like to run current games on high/ultra at 1080p, 60fps. However, since it's my first time doing it from scratch, I got a couple of questions:

Is the i5 6500 worth the price jump from the i5 6400? Here in Brazil theres a USD 100 difference between them and I'd rather spend it somewhere else if possible.

Also, would a motherboard with a H110M chipset be enough? I'm only planning on getting an HD, an SSD and the GPU (RX 480, if I can find it in the next few days), or should I go higher?

If there's a significant impact from getting one or the other, I could take a little longer on getting the parts, but I'd rather have them sooner rather than later, since I'm currently with no pc at all and will also be using it for work.
Instant phone background.
I've decided to try something different and read two books at once - no idea how that will turn out.

**Snow Crash, by Neal Stephenson** 

Snow Crash had been sitting on my shelves for quite a few months already, and I finally decided to move it up the line and give it a shot. Didn't get too far yet, but it seems promising. 

**Rationality: From AI to Zombies, by Eliezer Yudkowsky**

I have just finished Yudkowsky's *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality* and got really, really interested in it, so I picked up his book on the science behind it all. 
Will do. Thanks.
This is my problem exactly. I'm actually trying to wake up earlier so I can go running before work. That would solve both issues of not exercising and waking up too late, but  even the times I managed to wake up, I'll just go back to sleep. This changing thing is hard. 
I tried that, but then yesterday I spent the day moving stuff around my room, instead of doing what I had to do. I feel like my mind will search for anything to do other than what I have to do. 
I might try that for now, but it seems like a way to trick myself, instead of actually fixing the problem. Thanks, though. 
I'll try doing this for the longer term tasks. It can't hurt. Thanks!
Not particularly. I'm actually seeking psychological help, though, so who knows. I'll I know is that this has to stop.  
I don't think that's it. 

Although my current issues are work-related, I also had this problem at college - I'd sometimes start studying for exams literally hours before them, and I actually postponed my end of course paper until the last weekend.

Damn, I actually procrastinate about watching tv shows people recommend to me. 
That's kind of my problem. I can't seem to do the small amounts. If I actually start doing something, I'm able to spend hours at it with no break, but it takes me a long while to start (even if I just sit in front of the computer) and whenever I stop I have to build up that momentum all over again.

I also have a lot of trouble starting a project before getting dangerously close to its deadline - I have a hard time measuring its time consumption and forcing myself into doing it sooner.
I love how Pratchett manages to send powerful messages even when he's not being serious. 

Equal Rites faces gender inequality simply by asking "why?", showing how incredibly stupid it all is.
I want that right now.
Yes. While I do understand the division from a cultural point of view (especially when considering anglo-america and latin-america, more so than North, Central and South), I see it all as one continent, geographically.
I assume "american" means someone born in the US.

"America" is the continent.

Here in Brazil there is the term "estadunidense", which would be one who was born in the united states, but most people just say "american". 

As for the debate, I don't think it's really relevant. It feels like just another way people like to claim the US are "evil" and "imperialist", as if the name they call themselves made any difference. 
As far as I remember, even though he was technically untrained, didn't he kill a monster before starting his training?

Saitama was never an average guy.
I usually keep the same. If I ever decide on doing a playthrough skipping ME1, though, I can see myself picking up a ME1 save and changing classes.
This is some quality shitposting right here.
Growing up in a catholic school, religion never really "clicked" with me. My religious studies were almost historical, though - I was taught that a large portion of the bible was metaphorical (no creationism bullshit), and although religion was treated as a fact, there were never any major issues (as in, you could skip going to church if you said you didn't believe in it).

In my family, my grandmother is the only one who actually goes to church regularly, so christian values were taught, but the rituals were never enforced. 

This "freedom" may be the reason it took so long for me to step out of it. Religion felt natural: I believed in god, and was a good person, and that was enough.

The turning point, funnily enough, was when I watched The Devil's Advocate, in which the Devil, as portrayed by Al Pacino, talks about how God made everyone with a certain set of instincts and impulses, and then told everyone to do the opposite.

That was the first time I thought that stuff didn't make sense. That was followed by questioning why God would send his son to wipe out humanity's sins against God himself, and I never looked back.

Today, I keep a healthy "don't know" mindset, and while I can see religion's worth to the world, I realise it's not for me.
Vidalia is way too cool for that.
This twitter account is the best thing ever. I loved seeing Lapis next to her as she watched the stars, and now this. These two are wonderful.
I've never been a fan of sports games, and I don't even watch basketball, but my god is that game addicting.
Will do. Thanks!
Meh. That's a shame. There's a whole lot of great old school RPGs I haven't played yet, so I guess I'll stick to those.
Dark Souls (and Bloodborne) is similar to it in its challenge, and the fact that you need to learn how the enemies act in order to defeat them. I recommend it to everyone.

Also, if you haven't played it yet, you should definetely try Shadow of the Colossus - it is masterpiece.
I didn't play too much of it, because my PS2 broke down not too long after I got it, but I was really liking it.
Is it good? I was really looking forward to it, but didn't haven't heard much about it since.
Is it actually any good? I've seen it many times on the PS Store, but it just looked silly.
Final Fantasy XII is supposed to get a remaster next year.
I've never played any digimon game, so I must ask: is it actually *good*?

Right now, I have very limited time and *huge* backlog, full of giant, time-consuming RPGs, and although Cyber Sleuth looked really interesting, I'm afraid it won't be worth putting my time on it.
Scores are problematic because they are too simplistic.

A game with an amazing story but shitty gameplay and a game with an amazing gameplay but a shitty story might have a similar metascore, but whether you like each of them will depend on your priorities while gaming.

I'm exaggerating to make a point, but that's the idea.
There's only the FFX/X-2 remaster and that FFXIII mess.

FFX has a turn based system, but it has an amazing story and worldbuilding.

FFXII might be the only FF (besides XV) which has a combat system closer to KH, but it's far from the same. Still, they have announced it is getting remastered for a 2017 release, so it might be worth taking a look.
I played the original on the ps2 and got the remaster on the ps3.

 Almost got the re-remaster for the PS4, but stopped myself from throwing my money away. It's not like there's anything new there.
Oh, you lucky child.
I've though a lot about adulthood in the last few years (I'm 25) and came to a few conclusions: 

1. Being an adult is like being a teenager, but with the world expecting you do to adult stuff; which results in

2. Everyone just pretends to know what their doing, hoping no one will notice; and

3. Holy fuck, a significant number of the crazy and stupid people I met in college are gonna become judges and prosecutors and politicians. We are doomed.
Can't speak of the whole world, but I'm from Brazil and pretty much everyone I know who was old enough at the time remembers 9/11.

Fuck, I didn't even know the WTC existed back then and still remember seeing on TV. 
I like that Reaper replaces his whole guns, but still has a bunch of ammo on his chest.
Definetely. I'd love seeing Lapis and Peridot being really integrated into the group and going on missions.

However they decide to do it, I'm very excited to see Lapis again.
I went back to check, and it really has been a while. Since they're focusing on character episodes, maybe they could show the Crystal Gems on a mission episode. Amethyst could definetely use some love.

I don't think there's a single episode in S3 I didn't like, though, and I'm really excited to see the main plot moving forward.
My opinion when I first watched the show was that the first few episodes were nice, but far from amazing.

The world felt interesting from the start, but I felt like they just followed a formula of stupid kid Steven does stupid thing with magic - hijinks ensue. 

Rewatching it, I feel like each of those episodes, while simple, show the world in such a great way that make it very much worth watching. Even some episodes that I felt like skipping proved themselves to be amazing as I watched with the knowledge of what was to come.

Sure, there are very few "great" episodes on 1A, but I think there are quite a few really good ones.
Don't even joke about that.
I'd like to believe you mean the "want to sit on my face" line.
I don't know if it was me who grew out of it of if it got worse, but I even though I really liked Bleach, it came to a point when I was reading it just to get to see the end.

That was like a year ago. I'm glad I gave up.
I surely hope you're right. Despite my best efforts, I'm getting more and more hyped by this game.
Think positive: have you bought the game already? If not, you can at least wait and see if it matches your expectations and perhaps save some money.
I relly like the people from Beach City, but I miss Lapis so much. After she kind of appeared on Peridot's twitter account, I was so sure she'd show up on yesterday's episode and was so sad when she didn't.
Will check those out. Thanks!
I get what you're saying, but I think it's more like they were saying that everyone has different skills and "powers", and it's not because you can't do what others can't that you won't have your own talent.

It's more about learning to accept yourself as being different, and focusing on what you *can* do, instead of what you *can't*, and less about simply accepting your "flaws".

The idea is that everyone has skills, you just have to understand that they may not be the same as other people's. 
This is me. I'll see a monster, proceed to shoot it in the face, get rekt, try again, repeat until success.
This. I tried Adept HBG for the first time yesterday after spending the last couple of days trying to decide what to do, and I don't think I can step away from it anymore (maybe - just maybe - for the ability of jumping over giant monsters with my big ass gun).

I always loved how powerful HBG *felt*. Every single shot seems devastating. Now, with power reload and gunpowder infusion, it's just amazing.
I spent the past few days deciding and went with my beloved HBG. Now I'm trying to chose between the awesomeness of vaulting off monsters and the awesomeness of dodging through and getting *even more damage*.

As for arts, I simply can't decide. The speed-rain-thing is great, the power-reload thing raises the already insane damage of my bullets (and seems to have nearly 100% uptime) and the supernova just looks great.
Definetely. I watched it yesterday before going to bed and can't wait to get back home and watch it again.
Pearl is always perfect Pearl.
I've read the manga and watched the original anime, so Brotherhood (while being on my list) kind of got postponed.
Seriously. Monday's episode was interesting, but it left we waiting for so much more. 

But by god, did Tuesday's deliver. It just might be on my top 5 favorite episodes.
TBH, the only moment in which I could see Shepard getting a promotion is at the end of ME1.

She dies in ME2 and then starts working with Cerberus, which is a no-go, and then she explodes a Batarian colony and gets arrested, and then the world is ending and her rank becomes irrelevant.
People seem to forget the amazing QB play that happened in denver last year.
I've watched it. Got a little disappointed by the ending, but it was overall a great show. 
Steins;Gate is on my to-watch list. Loved TTGL and Haruhi.
The list is clearly not up to date, and here are some shows that I've watched a long time ago and decided to rewatch, which I left out of the "completed list". 

That being said, I've watched OPM and read Black Lagoon, but I'll check the others out. 
Ok, this looks really interesting. I'll definetely check it out.
Yes! His and Her Circumstances is one of the ones I was mentioned but had never heard of (I also completely forgot about it soon afterwards). I'll definetely check it out.

Same with the other ones, except maybe Garzey's Wing - not sure I have enough time to intentionally watch bad shows.
TIL there's an Anime of the Year award.

I've just watched the Ghost in the Shell movie last month. It was just amazing.

I'll check Utena and Vision of Escaflowne out. Thanks!
Alright, off to a great start.

I've finished Bebop - I'll update the list.

I'm also a huge Ghibli fan - have been going through them in order, recently.

I've read both Parasyte and Monster already - is it still worth watching the anime?

I'll check the other stuff out. Thanks!
Really? I never had any problems with it (and even if I did play it a lot, I'm far from an expert). Every time I had a question or needed help, I had no issues finding it. 

There's always going to be a couple of assholes here and there, but you can't let that tarnish the community as a whole. At least that was my experience. 
Do the tutorial quests even have check marks? 
I definetely do. I'm doing all the gathering quests first, to get them out of the way. 
Blasphemy.
What's not to like?
The only community I found that comes close to MH is the Souls one. 

My personal theory is that when the game is doing all it can to screw you over, people tend to stand together.

Good luck ahead, don't give up, and happy hunting!
If we beat the Cardinals with Garoppolo, I'll be pretty excited to see what we'll be able to do with Brady.
Where are the flairs for prowler mode?
Aerial HBG looks really really really cool, but I'm probably going with adept, which is more to my playstyle... but vaulting over a monster firing down would be *awesome*.

....god dammit, game, get here already.
You know what bothers me about it? They could have said it would only be out in the morning like weeks ago. It's not like they just decided not to have a midnight release.

Fuck, they could do it like any other platform and set up a timer on the eshop, instead of "coming soon".
This. Instead of playing in the morning, I'll have to wait until I get off work, and god knows when that will be. 
I could never "main" a single weapon. I usually fall back to the HBG, but if I spend like a week playing only HBG I already feel like changing (which is probably why I take so long to move on with the game).
I'll have to go digital. Only way to get it on day 1 where I live.
I'll probably main HBG again (probably adept), but I'm once again tempted to try the HH. Or maybe the bow, or the GL, or IG, or the SnS, or the SA, or the DB............. 

fuck.
The Palico nickname is always so hard. I randomly picked Wobbly in MH4U and regretted it for months.
I'll be glad if I'm able to get it on release, since Nintendo decided to give up on us.
I always make female characters on games. 
I switch between weapons every few weeks, mostly because I like change, but I always go back to the HBG.

I just love the playstyle of shooting a monster in the face with a huge-ass rifle, with the screen shaking after every shot, and dodging its attacks in the last moment.

Considering your problem, specifically, it must be noted that, while all weapons are perfectly viable, not all weapons are as easy to use against the same monsters. Also, make a point of trying every single weapon, find one that you think is the most fun/interesting/badass and learn how to play in a way to offset its cons.
Some of us have principles.
TIL I share my birthday with TB. Happy birthday to all of us, u/Buhlean and TB!
Bolacha não, né. Biscoito.
Not really. I've found that dodging through the attacks is usually more efficient than trying to run away in Dark Souls, too, unless you're going to block the damage.
Fromsoftware 101: dodge forward, not backward. 
To me, that was the greatest beauty in that scene.

Ramsey might disappear to the rest of the world, but he will always live within her.

His actions have changed her for good, and her being apparently able to give up on Rickon, despite him still being alive, is much more telling, to me, than her smile at his death.

From what we have seen so far, Sansa has changed from a naive, childish girl who believes in fairy tales to a cold, ruthless woman who is no longer willing to depend on anyone else.

It still remains to be seen how that will turn out, but Sansa's new worldview could actually become a way to counteract Jon's hotheadedness.
Orion is the least "team-oriented" of the bunch. After a while, he starts doing his own thing while everyone is trying to keep the game moving forward.

Aside from that, though, he was a really funny character, and I was sad to see him go.
I'm always trying to reload as Reinhardt.
What bothers me whenever I see something regarding Deflategate is that at this point I don't have any belief that Brady's image could ever be fully repaired on this matter.

There could be irrefutable proof that Brady's innocent (and honestly, pretty much everything points that way), but people will never let this go.

Brady is perhaps the greatest player to ever play QB, and will always have to deal with these bullshit claims of people who simply can't accept his and the Patriot's perennial dominance.
I'm just really really excited about it. It feels like it's really getting released again. Can't wait till I get home.
I still got at least 5 more hours before getting home. I'm dying inside.
My copy of Dark Souls is with a friend who has never finished the game. I want to be there for global restart, but don't want to stop him from experiencing the game until the end.

So I'm sorry to say that I'm probably not going to be joining everyone for this wonderful event. Have fun for me too, people.
Didn't miss much. Dragon kills stuff, you go around the world getting power ups, kill dragon. The end.
They'd better be beyond certain when they decide to ban anyone, then. 

Getting banned without having a chance do defend yourself is bullshit, no matter the reason. 
Either you lose players because of cheaters or you lose the cheaters. I know which one I prefer.

My only fear is of people being unfairly banned, but my experience with Blizzard's support has always been great, so I trust them to do a good job with it and review bans if necessary.
This. Zen can't really rush a point. He's too slow and too squishy for that.
There might be some balancing involved, but I'm not sure.
I'm pretty sure putting up a password removes level restrictions.
I want the cleanest design possible, which is one of the reasons it's taking so long. I'm torn between having the fire in color or having it be all in black.

My first idea was Sif, but I've spent weeks thinking about the best way to do it and couldn't think of any that would look good without being all dark and edgy.
When I stay too long from a game (as in, enough that I don't remember how to play it/the story), I usually start over.
There's a lot of controversy about DS2.

Some people think it's the best game ever (and for the PvP part, it apparently really is), and some think it's the worst in the series.

If you can get Scholar of the First Sin for cheap, I'd say its worth it - depending on your play style, you might really like it.

If you ask my personal opinion, I'd say that if you don't feel like you *have* to play every single game, you can just skip DS2 and go for DS3. I liked it a lot more than DS2, even if DS1 will always be my favorite.

Besides, as it's been said before, DS3 is pretty active right now, so you shouldn't have any issues getting summons.

If you can do it, I'd also strongly recommend you play Bloodborne and Demon's Souls.
That looks pretty awesome. I've been thinking about getting bonfire, myself.
While it might be frustrating to see the kill cam after every death, I really like it as a way to learn what I did wrong.
At least she didn't eat it while it was still alive.
I mean, people get "grabby" with random girls - there's no way it wouldn't happen with pornstars.
Just pictures, no sound, and there's a wall behind me. Safe enough.
This is just stunning. Seriously. I'm not really one to comment on art (don't really know enough to go beyond "hey, good work"), but I really do feel like this deserves it.

Mr. u/marksonwalls, whoever and wherever you are, thank you for this.

I'm now going to show it to everyone I know. 
My biggest issues were with the gameplay, to be honest. I'm kind of tired of the generic climbing around and shooting people thing.
1:26, on a 6 Zarya's team on Temple of Anubis - good times. 
Uncharted 4.

Hated Uncharted 1, felt like Uncharted 2 was just more of the same (altough with better mechanics). I think it's just not my kind of game. 
The only time I saw a Symmetra Potg was when my friends and I successfully defended temple of Anubis as 6 of them (which was followed by us capturing the same map in a little more than a minute, as 6 Zaryas). 

Good times. 
That's right. His healing is a song that heals everyone around him. (On consoles) you press l1 to switch between healing and speed songs and r1 for a boost to that song. 

The boost is very strong on both songs, but it is usually better to use it with healing, since it's your only way to heal large amounts of health over a short period of time. 
Keep moving, remember to switch to your speed aura when everyone is at full health and only use the burst when needed - it's your only real burst of healing and its on a relatively long cooldown.

Remember that you actually do quite a bit of damage and that pushing people away, even when not fatal, is incredibly disruptive.

Use your ult to counter enemy ults or to reinforce a push by your team.

I think that's Lucio 101, though I might have forgotten something.
Mercy is a more focused support - you won't be doing much by yourself, but you'll find yourself jumping from hero to hero keeping everyone topped up and buffing their damage. 

When I really want a win, I just go Mercy - I won't be doing that much by myself, but you can be sure I'll make it so everyone else does better.

Besides, hearing the "Heroes never die!" is incredibly satisfying.
Yeah, I try to absorb as much information I can from people on this sub and youtube, but I'm having a really hard time putting it into practice.
I'll try that. Thanks!
That man is one big hunk of willpower - even the gods go hollow, but there he is, hammering that anvil.  
It's one of they ways the game sets its tone. 

Everyone (aside from Andre, apparently) is fated to go hollow at some point - the only thing stopping them is their will to fulfill their own "quest", and they will keep going until they do it or their will falters.

There's no way to save them. They *will* go hollow - it's a matter of time, as Lucatiel's questline shows so well in DS2. The only choice you can make, as the player, is if you would rather help them fulfill their quests before they go or have them "live" a little longer, as they feel their sanity slither away.

Going back to the first Dark Souls, Solaire goes hollow when he is caught by the sunlight maggot, while desperately searching for his own sun - we know that he would never actually find it, so it bears thinking: would it be better for him to keep searching until he went hollow on his own, with his failure, or for him to go hollow believing he had done it?
I got really confused when I saw this title/sub combination in my front page.

Nonetheless, great work!
My take on it is that people came for you after you chugged and figured the first guy attacked because you had done it before without them seeing.

It's the only thing I can think of. Crazy shit.
I have just snapped my fingers while whistling for the first time in my life.

Thank you so much for granting me this experience.
Don't get me wrong, I'm ok with reworking him as a whole. What I'm against is just straight up nerfing him. 
It's a team game. Blizzard can't just nerf a hero because supports can't beat him alone. They're no really supposed to - that's why they're called supports. 
My issue with that is that the game has just been released. Bastion is easily countered if you know what you're doing. Nerfing him now because people are still learning the game will just make him useless in a few weeks/months (when he'll need to be buffed again, and people won't know how to deal with him, restarting the cycle). 
I'm actually postponing my NG playthtrough so I can get as much stuff as possible before moving on.

In a few weeks (months?), I'll be able to once again say I have platinum'd every Souls game except for DS2.

Edit: where are my manners? Congratz!
That's fair enough. 

Also, as far as I know, he did have the whole thing roughly planned, but things got out of hand. There's SO MUCH going on at any given time - the characters are all over the world, and everything that is happening is shown in the books (kind of).
I had no idea.
I'll be perfectly honest and say I usually can't remember the boss themes because I'm too worried trying not to die.

Since I played DS1 about a million times, though, I can talk about that: Gwyn's theme is one of my favorite pieces of soundtrack from any game, ever.

Dark Souls was my first game in the series. I took quite a few months to beat it, but that was because I rage quit at one point, after being killed by a rock in Sen's Fortress, and stayed away for months before coming back to it.

So imagine my feelings when, after being bloedied beating every other enemy Lordran had to offer and just after facing the desolation that is the kiln of the first flame, I step into that fog wall and hear that sad, almost mellow piano.

It had a sense of inevitability to it. That was it. I had come all the way, and the final battle wouldn't be an angry, frenetic clash of souls in battle, but just the final step before the chosen undead got to fulfill his destiny. There was no stopping it. It might take a couple of tries (and trust me, it did), but it would happen, and I would finally beat Dark Souls.

And it did happen. Granted, I had to get on full havel's and put up my iron skin pyromancy, but I sliced that god to pieces with my sword and kindled the fire. 

That's my single favorite moment of my favorite game of all time. 

Even on my (many) later runs, that feeling stuck with me. After I finally learned how to parry, everything came together - it really *was* inevitable. Gwyn was only a stepping stone - tiny, when compared to everything else I had come through. He was just there to give way to the new lord. 

TL;DR: Gwyn's theme is awesome.
The first book, *A Game of Thrones*, was released in 1996. *Winds of Winter* will be the sixth, so, yeah, 6 books in 20 years (if it's released this year, which is far from certain) isn't really a lot.

There's a lot in every single book, though, so it is actually worth reading them more than once. You always learn something new, and if you think people have crazy theories in this sub, you should go check r/asoiaf. Those people are *crazy*. 

With the way things are now, I actually feel that if he ended the series in book 6, he would be rushing it. There has to be a book to set things up for the end, and another one to tie it all together.
It was mostly a joke, but have you seen the cliffhangers that asshole GRRM leaves in his books? 

Considering the last one took 6 years to be released, and it's been 5 years since, I'd say it gets 1st place on suffering.

But we're getting offtopic, and SU is, indeed, a source of much suffering.
1. Dogs in DS1

2. Dogs in DS2

3. Dogs in DS3
This got me interested in joining a fight club way more than anything I've ever heard before - I mean, fuck it, I'll just go have fun getting rekt.
One of the reasons I gave up on the Darksword was because people hate it so much. I care way more than I should about what internet people think about my Dark Souls skills.

I mean, that R2 is the coolest thing ever.
Sworn to the Sword is definetely my favorite episode in the series - it at the same time develops Connie as a character, highlights Steven's loving and protective nature and delves into the abyss that's Pearl's mind.

That gem's got some serious issues.
So yeah, there's this book coming out, not sure if you've heard of it, it's called "Winds of Winter".
I think it has a lot to do with matches being so short. If the match is really one-sided, it can be over in 5 minutes or less, and then you're free to leave.
It took me a while to find it, but there it was. I assume it isn't larger because of the many variations of the name people use to bash on it.
I'm saving as many boxes as I can before opening them in a gigantic lootbox orgy.
This got me quite interested - I loved the Great Corvian Scythe, but never managed to get it to work. I think I know what I'm doing for my next build.
My Magic the Gathering cards. I'm pretty sure my parents threw them away without telling me in some of the times we moved, but I had invested a lot of time and money in them, and would really like having them back, even if just for sentimental reasons.
Man, I've just watched the first video today and was sad there wasn't any more of it. Seems like I picked a good day for it.
I don't know about the whole world of Steven Universe, but the crystal gems have been around Beach City for a long, long time (I mean, there's a giant woman sculpted in the rock just next to the city). Everyone from Beach City has grown up right next to the gems for the last few generations, so it isn't really that big of a deal for them.
This. I feel like it was also a great way to show that even now, even though he is much more mature than before, he is still just a kid. 

I mean, he gets all broody, singing about how he doesn't want Connie to be a part "his world" for her safety, but the second she actually comes to him, he's crying and regretting everything he said.

I'll admit that at the first few episodes, I didn't really like Steven as a character - I felt like they were mostly using his childish behavior as a way to create wacky magical situations -, but his development throughout the series ended up being one of my favorite things about SU.
This is great - I've been meaning to get into Dark Souls PvP since... well, since DS1, really, but never really did. Maybe I can finally do it on DS3.
I played hundreds of hours of DeS, DS1 and Bloodborne (I'm just now finishing DS3), but DS2 always felt kind of bland. I actually got SotFS for the PS4 and beat it just before realising I had already done it on the PS3.

idk, DS2 never really "clicked" for me, but I have never really played much PVP, even if it is something that has always fascinated me in the series.

It really bothers me that there's a Souls game I don't like. I keep feeling that it's all because there's something I could never understand about it.
Most of my friends are getting it for PS4, so that's what I'm going for.

...though I might eventually get a PC version as well. You can never have too much overwatch.
I feel like that about pretty much everything I do.

I live in a constant shift between being extremely confident and being sure I'm fucking up.

The truth is: you're never going to be 100% satisfied with what you do. There will always be something you'll wish you had done differently.

Just be ready to go back to what you have done and rewrite again and again. 

You'll eventually get to something you think it's at least ok. If you think it's ok and other people thing it's good, you're probably on the right path.
RIGHT? AND I MEAN, COME ON, IF YOU DON'T LIKE MERCY JUST PLAY LÚCIO AND FOCUS ON KILLING PEOPLE. JUST STAY CLOSE TO PEOPLE AND FIRE AWAY.
I first heard about it from my brother, who insisted I watched it.

I postponed it for a while, and then other friends started talking about how incredible it was.

So I started watching it, and although the first few episodes were silly, the world building behind it (or, should I say, it's *universe*) made me want to know more.

Then Steven stopped being just a cheap creator of conflict from his stupid, childish use of magic and grew into being a really fleshed out character, which, together with the rest of the cast - which was already amazing to begin with - made for one of the most interesting shows I've seen in quite a while.
They could focus it on the reactivation of Overwatch, instead of on specific characters, and hand out bits and pieces of each character's lore throughout the movie.

If they used the first Avengers movie as a formula, they could make sure each of the main characters was unique, without having to actually show the whole backstory for each of them.

Start it from the Recall and "Are you with us" videos, focus on the institution itself and on what the bad guys want, and have everyone fight in awesome scenes.

Give some hints on the characters that are not intrinsically tied into this conflict just to get people hyped.

Instant hit.
It's something about the theme song. I'm pretty sure there's some witchcraft involved.
I watched NGE a long time ago, and had no clue of what was happening. Always planned to give it another shot. People find it so amazing, it's gotta be my fault that nothing made sense there.
I've only watched the three movies, which I was made to believe repeat the series. Is it actually worth going to the show, itself?

Looking forward to an opportunity to watching PMMM again.
In theory, not at all. I'm having a great time with 3. The dungeon crawling does get old, though. 

My point was just that they're really long games, so playing both of them would take me way too long - especially when you add that up to the giant number of good games being released this year before P5 (I haven't even finished Dark Souls 3 yet, and Overwatch is on the horizon, just to talk about this month alone).

I haven't finished any of them yet, but it seems like P3's story is pretty amazing, which is why I decided to stuck with it. It has quite a few mechanical issues, though, and as I said, it gets repetitive at times, which are things P4 seems to have fixed.

That said, if you just want to get a feel for the series before P5 hits, you might want to go straight to P4, since the games aren't really connected, as far as I know.
I had the great idea of playing P3 before playing P4 before playing P5...

The good thing is that P5 will probably cost about 10 bucks by the time I get to it.
Only reason I put any points in vitality is so I can have the best looking sets.
And that's a pretty relevant spoiler. I'd be pissed if that was the way I found out it was in the game.
It wasn't, but I also saw that last night! Some crazy stuff happening these days.
The plan is to use the Demon's Fist, but I'll admit I haven't thought this through - no idea if it's even any good. Still gotta finish the game, first.
Dude, I want to make this so bad. But it will have to wait for my firepunches build.
Fo'realz. Twice in a row. I almos turned my PS4 off. No point in playing the game if people are being honest about them illusory walls.
Seriously: fuck the "no chugging" rule on invasions. I'm trying to move on with the game, and that fucker is trying to stop me.

I'll bow and acknowledge you when you come, but if you think I'll let you kill me and make me lose my progress because you think it's "fair", go fuck a goat.

I've yet to fight a red who doesn't try to bring me to the mobs.

If both parties are looking for PvP, ok, but if the guy is just hindering my progress, I'll greet him as he comes and proceed to use everything I can to stop him.
Yesterday I found two different Illusory Wall messages that actually showed Illusory Walls. I was in awe.


This. I feel like it's better than on previous games, but I'm still getting hit by that fucker on the other side of the room.
brb gonna make a ladle build.
TBH, I usually just go along trying to help the host (unless the fucker comes straight at me, as it usually happens). 

However, some things are too tempting to let go by, like when te host is standing just next to a ledge, asking for a kick.
I'm 100% sure I've invaders have died with me as a purple without getting the reward. Is there something to it?

Does it have to be me who actually kills the invader for me to get it?
Same. I had dismissed the game before I had actually played it in the open beta. I'm currently doing my best to make everyone I know try it out before it's over.
Both me and my brother got the e-mail and I am terrified that our PC won't run it. 

Let us all appreciate the irony in that.
I believe you're also getting a better first experience than usual. At least on PS4, the multiplayer experience is the best I've ever had.

Seriously, there are tons of summon signs everywhere, and I get regularly invaded. 

Is it frustrating? Fuck yes. But it's also amazing. I mentioned it to a friend and he suggested that I should walk around hollowed, to avoid the invaders as I move forward.

FUCK. THAT.
Sadly, I didn't get the invite for Overwatch.

A friend of mine got it and I basically spent a weeked at his place playing it like a crazy person.
It's basically because Overwatch is much better marketed and is from Blizzard.
I agree completely. I just meant that I totally get where they're coming from.
The appeal of Battleborn, to me, was that it was Borderlands without all the issues that pushed me away from it.

We have all the character , dialogue, and crazyness of Bornerlands, with a much better and creative combat system.

I had dismissed it at first, since it seemed similar to Overwatch and will be released just a few weeks before, but decided to give it a shot on the beta and fell in love with it.
Oh, absolutely. I just meant the issue with those tweets.

The greater issue on this whole story is definetely that TB can't stop from sabotaging himself by looking for what hurts him the most.
Battleborn is so incredibly different from any MOBA I've ever seen that I think calling it one is a disservice to the game.

Also, the "defining characteristics" of MOBAs are mostly arbitrary: I've actually asked this on another thread, and no two people gave me the same answer.

Going by yours:

>Control one character amongst teamed AI with the goal of working with X amount of other players on your team to beat the enemy team and break their base. Check.

This is true only for incursion. 

>Heavy emphasis on skills, levels, and RPG elements like talents or skill leveling, with a side economy based around items of some form. Check.

Most items on Battleborn work for the customization of characters. They're not nearly as important as on most MOBAs, which are usually focused around it, with you picking them throughout the match. Try playing DotA without items and see how well you do.

Also, most MOBAs work with the concept of "lanes", which is present only on Meltdown, which is closer to a multiplayer tower defense game than to a usual MOBA.

Finally, the third multiplayer mode is Capture:

>Teams of heroes face off in a fast-paced death match and must capture and hold objectives on the map to win. (from https://battleborn.com/en/info/)

Battleborn's focus is on being a "shooter" (which I'll use for the lack of a better term, even if many character don't actually "shoot"), not on the PvE aspects of most, if not all MOBA's.

Take a look at the game description on the official website:

>A tremendous band of badass heroes fight to protect the universe's very last star from a mysterious evil in this next-gen shooter by the creators of Borderlands. To defend it, you'll need to utilize every type of character and weapon you've ever imagined -- from cyborg hawkmen to samurai vampires to mini-gun wielding man-mountains. Slash and parry, run and gun, cast and dash, or simply obliterate foes all while building and growing your personal team of heroes. Choose your hero and fight alone or co-operatively alongside friends in story missions, or battle against them in fast-paced competitive multiplayer matches.

Battleborn takes elements from a lot of different genres and mix it up on a single game. Calling it a MOBA works only to give people the wrong idea - just as much as calling it an Overwatch clone.
The issue there is that both those tweets assume that TB's issue with the sub is a thought out, rational thing.

TB is literally sick, he can't help but seek out the worst criticism and get hurt from it. Is it bad for him as a public figure? Hell yes, but you can't always get things your way. I'm sure he'd like to be the guy who sees people trolling about him, laughs it out and keeps moving on, but that's not how things seem to work for him. And I bet fucking cancer doesn't really help him with that.

Genna isn't trying to silence criticism. She's trying to shield her husband from his own issues. And even though I don't believe it would help, I understand it completely.

I'm a big advocate of freedom of speech, but if something like this was causing so much pain to my family, I'd want it gone, too, even if that pain isn't rational.

In the end, the truth is that TB's pretty fucking good at what it does, and I'd trade this sub for his well being without giving it a second thought. Shit, I don't even own a gaming PC, and I still watch pretty much all his videos.

It's one thing to divert from your current objective to go get a crystal that just spawned.

It's another thing entirely to actually farm for them.
I love Orendi so much.
Paragon, I think
I get what you're saying, but I feel like BB is so far from traditional MOBA's that it kind of splits into a different genre.

Sure, there are some MOBA elements in it, that's undeniable. But I feel like the focus of Battleborn is on being a shooter. There isn't a time when you stop to farm stuff - the focus is always on the PvP, on all phases of a match.

It bothers me because people calling it a MOBA creates an image that's really far from what the game is actually like. 
I absolutely agree with you on the whole "hating Overwatch" thing. It's stupid to hate on a game just because it's "the competition". 

Just so you don't get me wrong, here: I am one who had dismissed Battleborn until I watched Totalbiscuit talking about it and decided to give it a shot on the open beta. I'm in love with it. 

But I'm still getting Overwatch. I'm fortunate enough to be able to get both of them (and trust me, they're both worth it).

The thing is: I've played both the betas, and while I did prefer the objective system from Battleborn, Overwatch is the better shooter. 

And even though you're right that the weeks Battleborn will have on Overwatch might shift people into buying it, I do believe it's a real concern that Battleborn might be lost because of timing, especially considering it's Blizzard on the other side.
I'm confused... I'd like to believe you're just baiting everyone into doing what's currently happening in this post (what with the Tracer fanservice and all), but I'm not quite sure.
Battleborn won't beat Overwatch at being Overwatch, so it has to show people that it's something else entirely. 

My only fear is that Battleborn will die out because people are too lazy to bother actually looking into it, instead just dismissing it as another Overwatch.

Overwatch is pretty much a super TF2, with more characters and made by Blizzard.
I'd actually call Battleborn a class based shooter that just happens to have MOBA elements.

Calling it a MOBA is stretching the genre pretty far, I think.

Besides, it is a fact that both Battleborn and Overwatch are colorful, class based, fps, and both are getting released on the same month. Comparisons are inevitable.

Add to that the fact that Overwatch is getting much more attention, and it makes people glance at battleborn and dismiss it as an "Overwatch clone", even if it's really not.

IMO, if comparison is inevitable, we should just show people how different the games really are.

To be fair, I'm probably getting both games. From what I played of both, I've actually liked Battleborn's objective system more, but Overwatch is a much better shooter.
Only reason I knew the right button on PS4 was because of Bloodborne.
This. I picked katana as my favorite weapon, mainly because I haven't really tried anything else yet.
This. Summoning sign showed up in seconds.
You're absolutely correct. I got them all mixed up.
Still 5 more hours to go. It's on times like these that I feel the need to reconsider what I do for a living.
"Black Phantom GOBACKTOWORKYOUFILTHYCASUL has invaded!"
Worst part? The worst part is that *I'm* very busy today, so much that I'm probably staying really late away from DS3.

It also doesn't really help that I can't concentrate at all thinking about getting home.
Yeah, just realised that from the comments. I just figured it was different, since I haven't found the other one yet. Did I miss it in firelink? Or is located after the way of blue, for some insane reason?
0) Dodge into attacks, not away.
What I usually do is try to kill the boss on my first attempt. ~~If~~ When I fail, I do some coop to learn the mechanics and avoid having to lose all my souls over and over.
I found that being agressive is better than not.

Tell him to always try to move forward, not backwards.
Weirdly enough, I got invaded about 5 times last night, and none of them had uchis.

Though they are probably going to get theirs after I REKT THEM FILTHY CASUL SCRUBS.
This. I got pretty excited when I got the Uchi, but I mainly didn't want him to think he was better than me.
I think it's in large part because you had to have the other covenant (can't remember the name) for people to be summoned to you. 

I just got way of blue and equiped it right before having to leave for work. Considering I've been invaded about 4 or 5 times in the short timespan I've played, I'm expecting some nice action.
I lost to it, miserably. Woke up about 5 hours later than I should have.
I'll play on my PS4 and get some nice, juicy, unstable 30.
Her heat beam also doesn't really need to be targeted, so she has complete freedom to move around, disrupting your attacks, while doing consistent damage and self healing. 

Not to mention that freaking shield.
It's just silly that you need a specific counter against her in a game in which you decide your character without knowing what's on the other side.
I have yet to unlock all the characters, but so far the only ones I didn't like much were Ambra, Benedict and Oscar Mike.

I absolutely love Galilea, Shayne & Aurox, Orendi and Reyna.
Ambra is just stupid. She's classified as support, but can take pretty much anyone 1v1 with her insane kit of damage, self healing and auto-shield.

It's bullshit that you can't take her down getting her by surprise with a pure-dps target. In most matches I simply don't even try taking her on unless I have someone else with me, and even then we sometimes lose.

I think there are a multitude of things that could be done to nerf her, like removing the auto-target aspect of her attack, nerfing the shield or heals, but I'm afraid that, as it frequently happens, they might go too far and make her too weak.
Yes. Yes, you are.
**Mistborn: The Well of Ascension, by Brandon Sanderson**

Just started it, but it seems promising. If it's even close to the first one, I know I'll love it.

Also just got to **Saga, Volume II** and **Rat Queens, Volume 2**, which were also amazing.
I have no idea. Sometimes I love a book so much it's the only thing I do, and sometimes I spend weeks without reading anything.

All in all, if we're only talking about books (as in, no internet articles or comics) I'd say it could vary from 0 to over 6 hours in a day.

Edit: also not counting work related readings.

This is exactly my case.

I had never heard of Sanderson before I subscribed to this sub, and the constant recommendations got me intrigued.

So I got Elantris a few weeks ago and absolutely loved it. Blazed through it in just a few days, which is saying a lot, considering my recent working schedule.

Just got Mistborn by the end of last week and the same happened, and now I'm waiting for Well of Ascention to arrive (in the same package as Hero of the Ages, since I don't intend to be kept waiting again between those two).
Ask me again in a few months. The way things are going, I should blaze through his works pretty fast.

And I actually got a kindle, but I really love having the books I like most on my shelves. I read Elantris on my kindle and regretted not buying the physical copy - not making that mistake again.
Not yet, I'm actually going by the order he wrote the books. Finished Elantris a couple of Weeks ago and just finished Mistborn yesterday (both were amazing, by the way). 

I'm currently waiting for the Well of Ascension to arrive at my place so I can go on with the series.
**Mistborn: The Final Empire, by Brandon Sanderson**

Loving it so far.
Just finished it yesterday. 

I was pleasantly surprised. I don't usually go for books so "real" (which is kind of the reason I joined said book-club), but I liked it way more than I expected.

First of all, let it be said that I found it to be amazingly well written. Even the parts I had issues with plotwise kept me going. The book has a great "flow" to it.

About the story, the first few pages made me worry. I didn't really like the character (which I guess is kind of the point) and I couldn't really grasp where it was going.

However, everything changes when he gets to Lucy's farm. The development of the character is great, as well as his struggle with his perception that he can't change, while still trying to make things work. I also really liked the way the author dealt with the development of his relationship with his daughter, especially after what happens.

Here's the thing, though. I felt like, although the book is called *Disgrace*, the disgrace itself doesn't really make much of an appearance. David runs from it at first, and doesn't seem to care much about it later. I tought that was a bit weird.

I also felt like the ending was a bit abrupt. Things were bad, than he went back to Cape Town and back to the farm way too fast.

Finally, one of the major things the book touches on - the post-apartheid South Africa, was a bit lost on me. I have studied the apartheid in school, and I can rationalize how life would be after a decades-long period of enforced ratial segregation, but, much as David can never really understand how Lucy feels, I feel like I'll never get what it's really like to live there. I'm from Brazil, and although racism is an obvious reality here, it has mostly been disguised, never being directly enforced by the law. 

Overall, I thought it was a pretty good.

Editted because I'm stupid with Reddit formatting.
The whole thing while he talks about his friends in Hogwarts is also pretty telling. My edition doesn't have the book number on the spine, though.
I was going to start reading **Disgrace, by J.M. Coetzee**, for my monthly book-club of sorts, but my copy of **Mistborn: the Final Empire, by Brandon Sanderson** just arrived in the mail today, so I'm not really sure what to do.

Probably pushing myself into speed-reading Disgrace, since I'm already behind on schedule for the monthly books.
Same here. My dad actually got it for me, and I only found out it was a sequel after I'd finished it.
I could go on forever about little details from *Discworld*.

I love the idea that light moves slowly;

I love the fact that people are not bothered after dying because their glands were left in their bodies.

I love that Ankh-Morpok is considered to be relatively murder-free, istead being full of suicides.

It's an amazing world overall.
This is a sad day. 
I get that there won't be cross-platform play, I just wanted to know if skins and stats, for exemple, would be shared if I link the accounts.
But if I get the game both on PC and PS4 (I have friends playing on both platforms), will I be able to use the same account on both of them? 
Not at all. I'll probably go with dex, for tradition, but everything else is up for grabs.

My first character is meant for experimenting.
This. One of the few memories I have of my grandfather is of him in the hospital, having to be reminded of who I was.

It's been almost 15 years since he died, and this is one of those memories I still struggle to deal with. Even if it's painful - and trust me, it is -, I make a point of keeping it alive, since there is so little I can remember of him. His voice is still clear in my head, and I hope will stay with me forever, but so much has been lost to the years.

Seriously, this prompt got me heartbroken before I read the very first story. This first story just crushed me.
Seriously, I just got heartbroken from the title of the prompt.
Came here to say Yellow Wallpaper. Had completely forgotten about The Lottery. 
But if anything, that was an issue with the game, not with the trophy. 

It would be weirder if there wasn't a a trophy for that. 
I absolutely love Kingdom Hearts, but the gameplay is not good enough to make me play it 3 times in a row, IMO. 

I have way too many games to play to spend my time on something less than ideal.
**Elantris, by Brandon Sanderson**

I've just finished *Good Omens* on Saturday, and decided to finally get into Sanderson's work. I haven't got too far into it, but so far it has not disappointed.
Bloodborne, Infamous: Second Son and Transistor were all amazing to get. Dark Souls also has a special place in my heart.

I have yet to get a "bad" platinum, since I usually just give up on it, but it's probably going to be Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin. I don't really want to do it, but it's the only one missing from the series...
I gave up on KH 1.5's platinum. Having to play once on each difficulty is bullshit.
I believe there are 2 possible approaches to chalice dungeons: 

1. doing them little by little, as you go through the game, seems to be the most sensible approach, gameplay-wise, since they are never too easy or too repetitive, since you're not pushing through all of it at once, but 2. if you wait until the end of the game, you can just rush through everything (except maybe for defiled chalice) without too much trouble.

But yeah, I've only been through them once. Not really worth the trouble.
Bloodborne perfected the trophy formula for FromSoftware's games, IMO. 

No bullshit grinding, while still pushing you to go through all of the game's content.
Second Son was a pretty good platinum. Nothing too grindy - even the collectibles were easy enough to get.
This is the only possible answer. The Newsroom has the best 1st episode ever made. I could watch it a million times and still love it. 
I'm still working on reading all of them, but I absolutely love *Equal Rites*. 
Doesn't as in won't have G Rank, or doesn't as in doesn't have G Rank for now?
I believe that's kind of the point. Besides, if you feel like you don't get something, you can always go check it out after you got the game.
So far I've only watched the official stuff. That was the restriction I decided on so I could avoid spoilers without being completely Souls-starved. There's no way I'm watching the actual game being played from the start.
I always go and watch the new trailers, and get pissed at learning stuff. But I admire your conviction.
The way the Dark Souls 2 trailers literally focused on how many different ways you were going to die on the game also didn't do much to help changing the image of it being unfairly difficult.

Seriously, these are games in which you can reasonably (sort of) play without ever leveling up. There are playthroughs of people finishing the game without taking damage, for fucks sake.

I understand that the games are not for everyone. Some people just don't like the core of what this community loves, and that's ok. But the "difficulty" part is just a learning curve that's steeper than usual.

There's a reason Souls veterans have an easier time playing the new games, even though they don't know what's in the shadow any more than the newcomers. 
Isn't it coming out for both consoles, though? 

I don't really use my Wii U for anything (what with Nintendo giving up on Brazil and all, making all games cost about twice as much), so I could basically have skipped it.
That's kind of the point. I'd run up to the dragon and it would kill my party in seconds while I soloed it with no effort at all.
DON'T play as a Knight Enchanter. You get to be such an immortal beast the game kind of loses its purpose.
Thanks to Nintendo giving up on Brazil, I'm most likely not getting it, which is a real shame.
Which is the reason I got so pissed at Zelda U becoming Zelda NX
If they liked Coraline, you could step into other works by Neil Gaiman, like *The Graveyard Book* and *Stardust*.

I also really liked the *The Seventh Tower* series, by Garth Nix, as I was growing up, so maybe give that a look.
Lovecraft is always interesting when looking for horror stories.

Also, not really on the serious side, but if you liked *The Colour of Magic*, you should definetely check out his other works.

*The Colour of Magic* is widely considered one of the weakest books from the Discworld Series, so if you liked that one, you will most likely love the rest. Try *Guards! Guards!*. It is just amazing.
Pretty much anything by Neil Gaiman, really.
I can't recommend Terry Pratchett enough. His books have the same style of Adams', but in a fantasy setting.

Also, as much as I love Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett is simply a genius. His works are a gigantic satire on all aspects of life itself. You should definetely look into his Discworld Series.


They usually have it stickied, not sure why it's no longer there.
So here's what happening right now in my current group.

My character is a bard, who's really kind of a free spirit. The backstory is quite simple, and boild down him being searching the world for his disappeared sister.

However, our campaign got the party guarding someone who won't tell us *why* it is important for her to be guarding, but we learned that if she doesn't do whatever the fuck she has to do, the consequences will be catastrophic.

My character hated that, and he doesn't really like any of the other party members (one of them is so stupid he almost got killed running into the same trap twice, and another one shot my character with an arrow once, just for the heck of it).

Don't get me wrong. I really like the campaign and our group, but my character is just getting fed up with it. Then the DM drops a plot hook that might lead to his sister, and one of the players have the brilliant idea to convince him, through illusions, that she's in current danger.

We cut the session there, and I'm still waiting to see what will happen with the party on the next session, but I can't see my character sticking with them for too long. He might stick around until we finish what they're doing right now, but that's it, and I'm making a new character.

My point is: sometimes players are assholes who like playing the whole "skulky lone wolf" part. But sometimes things develop in a way that is simply makes no sense for a character to stick around.
Oh, and if you loved BB, don't give up on the others because of DS2. Try to get DS1 or Demons Souls - they are *much* better games.
My first attempt to play DS2, I went with a dex build - it was what I had done in Demons and DS1, and really, it's just my favorite way to play. 

It's one of the reasons I liked BB so much - being able to swing giant weapons without losing speed and mobility.

It didn't work so well in DS2, and I quit after a while. I just wasn't fun enough to compensate all the struggle.

I came back to it by the end of last year, though, and decided to go the other way around. Easiest playthrough I ever had in a souls game.
I've been doing this for what? 4 billion years? And what did I get in exchange?

People see me and start running. Seriously, you'd think someone who had been dying with cancer for the last 3 years would welcome me, but no, of course not.

Why have an eternity of peace when you can have a couple more seconds of pain and suffering? 

"It's gotta be better than Death", they say. Do you have any idea of how that feels? 

People call me the "Grim Reaper". "GRIM REAPER"! Look at me. Am I really grim? 

And what about reaper? It's not my fault people see me like that! I just look like what they expect me to! Why would I be carrying a scythe? Do you have any idea how much trouble those things are? I tried it once, you know? Just to see what it'd be like. It's a hassle just to get through doors! They should be blaming the *media*. They are the ones who keep spreading this false image of me.

I mean, I didn't choose this. Not *really*.

I was *told* I'd be guiding people to the other side. No one told me they would think *I* was the one killing everyone! I just wanted to help! No one likes being lost!

I mean, Hinduism was cool with it, you know? "Death" was just a path. Back then, people would be thankful for my help, even if I looked like a 4-armed giant.

But then *christianity* came, and people decided that if you were bad, you'd go to "hell", to suffer for all eternity. But here's the thing: *everyone* is bad, one way or another. Gandhi? Mother Teresa? All bad.

Even if people think they were mostly good, they get terrified when they see me! Because *what if* there was something wrong? Seriously, no wonder I'm so thin, having to run after people all the time...

&nbsp;

...Well, I think it's time, then, but tell me: what do you think, doctor?

...Doctor?

Dammit! You were supposed to be helping me!

...Why do they *always* run?
DS2 was the easiest of them all, IMO.

Just get a large shield and a huge-ass weapon and tank the shit out of everything. 
Bloodborne's focus on dodging forces you to be much more precise than DS2.

No matter how much hp you have, Ludwig will wreck you up if you mess up.
DS2 is a whole different game. In DS2 if you just hide behind a big shield you just walk through the whole game.
This is awesome.
One thing I've learned in the last few years is that no matter how confident people seem, most of them are just bullshitting their way through life. If you're asked a question you don't know, give them your best guess as fact and check it later.

What they see is more important than what you know.
I've actually learned of this poem while watching the movie *Invictus*, in which it is read by Morgan Freeman.

Freeman's voice definetely carries some weight with it, but the fact stands whole poem has indescribable power to it. 

I don't usually get anything from quotes like this, but this one had an instant impact on me, so much that I've written it down and stuck it to my wall, so I will always remember it.

I *will not* let the world get the best of me. I *will not* let life beat me into submission. If things are going bad, I will grit my teeth and move on with my head straight, and I *will* be the one left standing in the end.
Ah, that looks pretty cool. Great work!
It is. He and the two doctoral candidates are the Three Wise Man, bringing gifts to Jesus.
"How can we possibly be falling?!", Robert screamed, holding on as best as he could in their time capsule as it shook.

"Technically, sir, I think you could say we're crashing." - That was the Johnson, always unnervingly optimistic - "If you think about it, it could be worse."

"*Worse?* How could it possibly be worse?! And HOW THE FUCK CAN WE BE FALLING? WE WERE ON SOLID GROUND NOT TWO MINUTES AGO!"

"Well, that's the thing, isn't it? We were on solid aground about 66 million years in the future. It seems like someone forgot to calculate add the movement of the Earth into their calculation. As far as I know, we could be drifting in space right now, never to be seen again. Having an atmosphere seems pretty good in comparison."

"WHAT'S SO GOOD ABOUT HAVING AN ATMOSPHERE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE MELTED WITH ALL THE PARTS OF THIS TIME MACHINE AS WE BURN THROUGH IT?!"

"Burn? Nah, this thing is pretty resistant. We're more likely to die on the crash. If you think about, it, though, we might actually be able to witness what we came here for - take a peek at the window, see if see any dinosaurs!"

"WHO THE FUCK CARES ABOUT-- ... wait. You don't mean what I think you mean."

"Have you seen the size of this thing? Do you have any idea how fast we're going down?"

"WHAT? NO! FUCK!"

"There's no need to be crass, sir."

"WHO THE FUCK CARES?! WE'RE SUPPOSED TO LEARN ABOUT THE GODDAMN EXTINCTION, NOT FUCKING CAUSE IT!"

"Sir, I'm right here next to you, there's no need to shout."

"AAAAAAAAARRRRGH."

"You should probably calm down. Do you want some water?"

"..."

"Besides, if you think about it, we are learning about the extinctio-- hey, look! A dinosa-- *gasp*"


*You see, kids, everyone dies in the end, but optimists die first. Don't be the optimist in a crashing time machine.*
I spent most of the time reading trying to imagine actual gigantic dragons doing everyday things.

Imagining Greenscale squeezed inside a cubicle trying to count the tiny coins put a smile on my face.

And the ending was very appropriate. His ancestors were legends, but he would be defeated by a child? Absolutely no way.
The setting is actually one of the reasons I want to try Numenera. It seems very interesting and, if I'm looking for a change from D&D, might as well go big on the weirdness.
Oh, I know that, I just thought it would get increasingly infuriating to the character for each 9 in there.

If it makes you feel any better, you could replace USDs for any highly inflated currency around the globe, or just pretend this is in the future.
Thanks!
This looks awesome!

One thing, though - don't you think that the intro text should be followed by "Mass Effect", and then the 2, and not the other way around?

Maybe even start with "Mass Effect", add the 2, then take it off again for the flashy fade-out of the title, which looks amazing, btw.
Oooohh, this is interesting. I hadn't really thought about this before.

Just throwing some ideas since I'm at work.

In a D&D environment, when I think of the rites themselves, I think of survival. Those are hostile worlds, and a child must learn to use their skills and survive in it. 

I also think the rite would be a way for the child to distinguish himself. He could get a new name, be known by something that happened specifically to him in the rite (see my ideas on druids and rangers below).

* Druids in a certain tribe have to shapeshift and live in union with nature for a month before returning. Ideally, the druid would join a group of animals and embrace their nature, whatever that may be - I'm thinking of using this with the idea that the druid would find out his/her "main" form in this process, but I have to think on it;

* Rangers who would choose a noteworthy beast to track down and kill/tame. The ranger-in-training could choose the beast he would go after, but hunting a more dangerous and notorious beast would be a symbol of power and valor;

* Sorcerers could be put in crafted dangerous environments surrounded by an anti-magic field, so they would need to use their own skills to get out;

* Bards in high-prestige academies would have gigantic end-of-training performances;

* Monks going through a final test of their skills in absolute darkness, having to *feel* their environments and use all their senses in combat;

I could also see a barbarian wearing the pelt of a bear he just killed, but I'm not sure how to do it in an original way that's not 1) put him in a pit against a bear; or 2) throw him in the mountains and let him come back by himself.
Cool. I think I'll grab it and see what's up with it.
I'll check those out. Thanks!
Those were my exact thoughts, and not even as a joke. I think this is literally the first time anyone has ever sent me a link to G+ (besides the old "join Google+!" crap).
I was worried about that, but felt that the characters were different enough that it wouldn't be a problem. I think highlighting each character's dialogue would kind of defeat it's purpose.
I'm glad to be of service.
Thanks, I'm glad you liked it!
Thanks! I don't usually get such imediate ideas when I see prompts, and fell I shouldn't waste it.
"What do you mean I can't buy the moon?"
I think this could work, but the only way to make it really believable would be to set some variables to it. Not sure how to simplify it in a way it makes sense. 

Here's the thing: It doesn't make much sense to me that "noteworthy" actions would be made known imediately. Using your exemple: even if the players just discovered the location of a super valuable relic, how would anyone know, unless they tell them?

Maybe you could make it so that you roll it only when they mention what they did to someone. If they were sent to do something for the leader of a village, they will go back to the village and talk to the leader - at this time, someone might hear it, and some of the factions may get wind of it (if que quest itself is noteworthy, you might want to roll it both when they are sent to do it and when they return).

As they get more widely known (and you could use NP for this), you might want to start rolling for whenever they meet with someone ("*You won't believe who I saw today! The PC's! They're so awesome! A bit smaller than I imagined, though*").

At some point, some of the factions could start taking active notice of them (you could set a threshold for that, based on the number of time the faction hears of the players and their NP), at which point they might start looking for more information.

In more relevant/larger villages and cities, you could roll to check if the factions might have informants/spies there, which would increase the chances the players movements are known by that faction (maybe in that case, you could roll it during the session).

Whatever way you prefer, you should definetely do it between sessions (unless there is a faction spy or if the players are very close to one of the faction's hideouts/headquarters). This way you won't be slowing down the pace of the game, while also being justifiable, since even if word travels fast, it should take a while before it reaches the factions ears and allows them to go after the players.

All of this seems overly complicated, though, so you might just want to roll it once when they pass through any sort of community, and again to see which factions learned about it.

About you example: if the relic is important to a specific faction, the faction should be keeping a look at it, so you could just make it so they automatically find out, or you could exceptionally roll it at that moment. If the faction is not actively monitoring said relic, it doesn't really make sense for them to instantly know it's gone.

I really like the NP idea, but the number might need some tweaking, so that the players start being tracked at a good point (it will all depends on how generous you are with gp and xp). You could also take a look at the [reputation system](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/4528we/bardic_reputation_and_performances/) u/famoushippopotamus made for bards for inspiration there.

*Disclaimer: I wrote a lot of things, and the text box is really small, so this might make no sense.*
This is genius.
"Wait, what do you mean we're going to ADD $4,000,000 to the vault?"

"That was the boss's orders."

"That makes no sense. Why would someone risk jail to *lose* money?"

"Don't know, don't care. That's what he's paying us for, so I'm doing what I'm told and getting the fuck out of here. Now get to work."

"All right... all right... no need to get angry. It's just... I always knew the man was weird, but *damn*."

&nbsp;

---------------------------------------------------------------------

&nbsp;

"Boss, it's done."

"Yeah, someone out there is $4,000,000 richer than last night... for some reason."

"*Some reason*? You think I'm crazy, don't you?"

"That's not what he meant, boss, he's new, doesn't know what he's..."

"Look, it's just that... it's your money and all, but why would anyone ever break into a vault to put *more* money in it? If you don't want it, you could just give it to me - no need to break into anything."

"...why? You mean you *don't know* why I sent you there? Don't you ever read the newspapers?"

"What? I don't get it."

"You idiot! Look at this!"

"What? 'The world's largest money vault'? What does that have to do with anything? Why does it matter to you that some vault has more money than others?"

"THE NUMBER! LOOK AT THE NUMBER! HOW MUCH MONEY WAS THERE IN THE VAULT?"

"What? Let me... no... no way..."

"Now you see why I had you do it?"

"You don't mean to tell me..."

"Exactly $999,999,996,000,000. How could I-- how could *anyone* leave it like that?"

"...I don't believe it."

&nbsp;

----------------------------------------------------------------

&nbsp;

Yeah, I don't usually write anything here, but the idea popped into my head as soon as I saw the prompt, so I thought - why not?

Also decided to experiment a bit, working only on dialogue - I hope I managed to keep the characters distinct enough it won't be a problem.

I think this is pretty good. Maybe if the party knows they are being pursued, it could increase the DC on the tracking check, since they will at least try to make it harder on their pursuers.

The tracking check should probably still be made with advantage, tough, since the pursuers already know the general direction the party is moving, and the party is worrying more about speed than stealth.

And don't worry about any arguments, I think we're building something interesting here.
I might actually read it all this time.
Now you play it again and again and again and again.
Can't really talk much about it. I never got too much into it, read the first one when it first came out and thought it was ok, but not good enough for me to really want the other two.

I've been meaning to give it another shot.
Regardless of personal taste, both Narnia and Harry Potter were insanely influential to the world. Many of the other "best" fantasy books might have changed the fantasy world, but very few books have ever made a global and cultural impact as impressive as Harry Potter.

I'm not saying they should definetely be on a top 30 list, but they without a doubt deserve consideration.
It makes no sense to me that a pursuing agent would be able to attack them from behind if they're going as fast as they can. Sure, they should definetely be susceptible to ambushes ahead of them, but the pursuers should be working hard just to keep up, not being able to worry about stealth or, at least, losing ground to them.

IMO, the fast travel should work both to get to point A to point B as fast as they can *and* to try and outrun pursuers.
One thing that wasn't quite clear to me. Did you start the campaign already? Or are you looking for input for a new one? Because introducing that system of movement on the run seems to indicate that they at least may be followed in a near future.

Regardless of that, I think that it could work well, though I think the players going faster should also give the trackers some sort of disadvantage on the tracking. Something like: 

1. When traveling fast, the players have this or that sort of disadvantage (increase the chance of being ambushed, for example), while eventual trackers also have a harder time staying stealthed as they follow - after all, they have to rush to keep up with the party.

2. On survival, its kind of the neutral stance - this way the party travels at reasonable speed and is able to guard themselves against ambushes, but that's also when it's easier to track them.

3. On stealth, the party is all but "immune" to ambushes - hell, they might ambush the ambushers themselves, and they are hard to track, but the trackers have easier stealth rolls, due to the slower pace.
You can always argue about any sort of "best of" list, but I do feel like both Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia deserve at least consideration.
I usually just put up the fist volume of comics on my read list, so while sometimes it's less than the usual book, other times it's a lot more, so it kind of evens out in the end.
I think this could work well, but it might make sense to make the agents roll both for stealth and for the tracking of the players itself.
My main issue with Rocket League is that I don't have nearly enough time to get nearly good enough in it to be satisfied... so I basically play a few games every once in a while, get frustrated and leave.

I'm not a patient man.
I actually read this as "Welcome to Real Life!" and thought it was oddly appropriate.
I agree that biotic powers are insane on ME1, but I've always treated the squadmates as kind of dispensable. With Immunity, you basically outlast everything, and the damage from snipers is good enough to make you never have to worry about them. 

TBH, keeping your squadmates alive on ME1 always seemed like too much work for too little gain.
I just love Infiltrator. Slowing down time is great, and the cloak is very versatile, being able to use it both offensively, as a huge damage boost, and defensively, cloaking as you reposition yourself.
When you say adept and sentinel are the only sane options for ME1, you mean it for insanity, right? Because infiltrator and soldier get pretty strong when you level a bit (snipers are ridiculously strong and immunity is just stupid).

I haven't really finished ME1 on insanity yet (I don't feel the gameplay is good enough for me to suffer through it, even if I might eventually try it just for the platinum).
I actually have the first Dragonlance book on my shelf. I've read over a decade ago, and can't remember any of it, except that I liked it. I'll check it out again.
Will do. Thanks
Funnily enough, I'm more of a fan of Fantasy than Sci-Fi, but I've read all but one in this list, and but a few of the other.
I'll look into it. Thanks!
I'll check it out. Thanks!
Thanks! Big fan of *Discworld*, *Kingkiller* and *A Song of Ice and Fire*. Started reading *His Dark Materials*, but never got around to finishing the second book.

I'll check the other stuff out.

On another note: this seems like a part of a long, pre-existing list that would cover many different genres - any chance you can send me that? Or is it on a really obvious place I forgot to check?

*Edit: I particularly like how all of Brandon Sanderson's works seem to have some sort of uniqueness to them (also, all of his works are insanely well reviewed on Goodreads). Any tips on where to start?
Already counting the days until TWoW and dreading the coming new season of the series, which I'll be forced to watch since it's not reasonable to believe I'll be able to avoid spoilers until the book is out.
I recommend you go through op's route and give "Good Omens" a shot. It's not part of the Discworld series, but I think it captures Terry Pratchett's style perfectly, so it could be a good way for you to see if you'd be into it.

Besides, I've always felt like Terry Pratchett was to fantasy what Douglas Adams was to science fiction, so it might be worth giving it a shot, even if you're not usually a fan of humor (I'm not, either, I just *really* love how both series go beyond their genres to become parodies of life itself).
While I agree that it does feel like a series, I fell like it should be mentioned that all of them work as stand alone titles.

While reading all of them in order is definetely beneficial to the series, you can pick up any of them at random and enjoy it.
"Guards! Guards!" is amazing, but I'm particularly fond of "Equal Rites", or anything with DEATH in it.
I liked Colour of Magic, but it's not even close to some of the other books of the series. I've also never been much of a fan of Rincewind.
I'm still far from finishing them all, but Discworld is my go-to series whenever I can't think of what to read next.
So, I've always loved fantasy. I've been recently branching out a bit, but I feel like coming back home.

So, what's a good fantasy book or series I should pick up next? I'm keeping this intentionally open - I like pretty much everything and am not afraid of longer series, as long as it's well written. 

I thought you were joking yourself, considering the username
All is good as long as everyone is having fun. That's the beauty of the game.

If you're afraid of railroading, I think you should just ask yourself: what happens if the players decide *not* to fight the mage?

If they have that option, even if it comes with dire consequences, then you should be fine.
Stare in disbelief.
That's why I didn't want to say zombies.

You could also go the opposite way: there is no infection. The crew raised the yellow flag to avoid being attacked/captured during their flight from something else.
I don't want to say zombies, but zombies. Or something like it. A parasyte that takes control of the host.

You could also have it carry some sort of monster or beast the ship was transporting, and have the ship drifting as all sailors died just after raising the flag to try to stop the creature from escaping.
I usually work around 10-12 hours on weekdays, besides some leftovers on weekends, so I was having the same problem you have.

I've always loved reading, so not being able to remember 5 new books I had read last year came as a shock. I was terrified - what was I doing with my life?

I've then decided to put a bigger effort on reading this year, which has been working pretty well, considering I've already finished more books this year than I remember finishing last year.

What I did is actually pretty simple: I carry my kindle/book everywhere I go, and read whenever I can. Instead of idly checking reddit, I'll read. Comuting? Read. Waiting room? Read. Bathroom? Read. 

Most of my reading, however, is done when I go to bad (which is actually becoming a problem, since I have a hard time stopping after I start reading).

I think the major thing is setting priorities for your free time (and social events are not considered "free time" - I'm not skipping on meeting with friends for reading). I really like playing videogames and watching movies and TV series, but I've cut some of that in favor of reading.
What I'm doing in my world is that the gods' fight in the material plane is a fight for influence.

They might be ravaging everything on their plane, but on the material plane they basically try to make people do whatever it is that might give them an advantage (e.g. having their followers burn forests to weaken the gods of the woods, or requesting sacrifices).

If you follow something like this, the angels might work as the gods' agents on the material plane, as they need a more direct influence over the world as the war goes on.
Jack in ME2 is amazing. Jack in ME3 is one of the best characters in the whole history of characters.
I already roll FemShep 99% of the time. I'd have jumped into that krogan loveboat without a second thought. 

Best. Race. Ever.
They definetely did. And though they change so much, none of it feels forced. All the changes seem like the natural course in their growth.
Honestly, I like idea of a good old fashioned crossbow behind the counter. Maybe a broadsword, if you want to put a twist to it while also homaging Tarantino.
It depends on how available magic is on the world. It could be expensive or inneficient to put an alarm spell on every single item in the store.
Liara's evolution on the series is just amazing.
I've actually romanced Kaiden on ME1 for the first time not two weeks ago.

Now that I got to ME2, I'm going for Garrus, to see what happens (seems to be pretty popular), but Liara is the one true romance option for my dear FemShep.
This. If I was the one playing and got all the way to the finish just to die on a gigantic explosion, I'd be pissed.

A noble sacrifice, however, would be awesome.
Being completely honest - if the players do try and kill the giant all-powerful-looking silver dragon, that falls into my "stupid enough for a TPK" category.

I wouldn't even feel bad.


This is pretty good - the dream scenario would be the players crashing through the wind wall, but I'll keep it in store if it seems they wouldn't be willing to face that particular danger.

As for the incentive to crossing the wall, I might have people running away from the creature towards the PCs.

Thanks!
Heh, I like the idea of the island sinking, but I might have one of the mages use the taboo spell Wish to save it, and have it become a flying "castle" (since the lower levels are larger than the higher ones), creating a whole new problem.
Not sure I agree with Time and Change being the same, but I can see what you mean. Much of it is still a work in progress. I'll do some thinking on it.

On the gods' influence, I was actually thinking about it yesterday. I'm thinking that the major gods might not be able to influence the world directly due to them being in another plane (or something like it). The *minor* gods, however, are created on the mortal plane of existence, which could make for some interesting "gods walking among us" ideas (my brother actually suggested that the reason the PCs were sent to the island is that one of the gods created on the island wanted to leave, but couldn't - not sure I'm using, but it's an idea).

On the whole over-planning thing: I agree completely. It's just that this idea came to me two nights ago and I couldn't resist working on it - these surges of inspiration don't really come to me too often.
Oh, I've done that already. I want this to be a *full* renegade playthrough, with all the lovely heart wrenching moments.

I feel bad just thinking about it...
This... This is just wonderful
I've started mine just last week. Currently playing ME2 and still hoping O can muster the courage for a full renegade playthrough before ME:A
Not sure about the flood as a way to get them inside, but it should be a great plot device when they get there. 
I might end up using all the ideas from this post. The PCs should be sent to Threndor for a specific reason, and the god of light would be a great way to set them on their way (then again, can't make it too easy for them, so the cult who rejects the attempts of leaving should have their own god, who will try and stop the PCs).
Quick question: how do you guys keep track of time? Say, if the players are on a long journey with a caravan of NPC's, that should take a week or so, do you play the whole week? Or put up a couple of encounters and fast forward through the rest?

Also, throughout the adventure, do you make a point of pointing it out to the players every day that passes by, with them having to actively have a long rest, and all?

I want to set up some timed events, but I'm having trouble thinking of a way to keep track of time with precision without having it clunk the game.
This is actually quite funny coming from a Five-Headed Dragon.
I might give up on overpopulation being the reason they first got underground. Maybe they found a whole civilization underground - after the wish, but still long, long ago. When living underground became a reasonable alternative there was no reason to enforce strict population control, and *then* they might start moving deeper underground, and *then* the value of sunlight and the consequent stratification of society ensues.

It also seems reasonable to think that there was some sort of conflict between the Threndorians and the new-found underground civilization, as the Threndorians spread into their domains.
Ok, first of all, disclaimer: I LOVE THIS. I am definetely using this idea some way or another (if not on this world, on some other random campaign). Just like that, you created a mad wizard who got his tower stuck in a marble for the last 70 years together with all his servants and a goldfish.

However, it is much less awe-inspiring than the gigantic tornado I had in mind. I want the way into Threndor to be epic. Even if the PCs end up there by accident, it should be an epic accident (*"shit, just rolled a 1 on my perception check and stumbled into Aslor, the god of hugeass mountains, who punted me through that unexplicable hurricane in the middle of the ocean"*)
This is actally pretty good. The ones in the surface have always been different from the rest - they might be able to keep trading with the outside secret from the sub-dwellers. It would open up the way for the PCs, and maintain the underground society's particularities, while adding depth to the whole thing.

A friend of mine actually suggested that the barrier was being kept up by the religious sect that claimed the world outside didn't exist. The idea is that the storm would lose strenght every x years, and the sect would use a ritual to reinforce it - on that moment, however, it would be possible to cross the barrier.
I don't really have a problem with magical solutions, it just has to be done in such a way that would be justifiable for people to spend all that time without coming up with it.

The idea I like the most so far is a non-magical airship. Since such technology is fairly recent in the world, It would explain no one using it sooner. 

Still, it should probably crash as it crosses the barrier, though I might have a decent mechanic go with them so they have a chance of going back.
The issue with that is that the wish happened hundreds or thousands of years before the game, so we get back to the players starting on the island.

Edit: rephrasing.
Thanks for the help! I like your idea for the overpopulation quite a bit - might have to tweak it a bit, since I feel like even with immortal people, population control would still be enforced.

I'll have to think on it.
My worry about the island being too small was that the city should already be large enough by the time it got isolated that it (i) was drawing other, more powerful nation's attention; and (ii) had a mage powerful enough to cast the wish.

I actually hadn't considered that the city should be larger as it got lower, which was really stupid, so it opens up some options - the lower levels might actually be much more spacious than the ones closer to the surface. It also helps the idea of having underground forests, which is good, so thanks.

On how they got there, I hadn't really considered them actually being there to begin with - which could open up many interesting storylines.  

However, I was actually thinking of someone getting there from the outside (or leaving from the inside). 

I thought about airships and such, which didn't exist at the time the island got isolated, but that wouldn't explain why it stayed isolated. A tunnel, on the other hand, would be just silly. 

So what I'm thinking is that I have to find a way for the PCs to cross the barrier. I might end up making it so that the city was isolated so long ago people believe it to be just a myth created to explain the gigantic tornado, and that it remained isolated because the Threndorians never developed the necessary technology and no one would dare risk trying to cross it just to see if a silly bedtime story was actually true.
**New DM Questions**

I've been meaning to start a campaign soon, with new players, but I still have some things I want to decide before we begin:

1) Setting

I've seen many people recommend starting with starting with a premade campaign, but I've been working on creating a new world for some time, now - nothing too crazy, mostly working around what exists already.

Also, I don't really feel like working on a pre-existing story, since a major part of what attracts me to DMing is the story and world building.

However, I'm a bit scared of messing up and ruining D&D forever for the group, since it's going to be the first tabletop RPG experience for most of them. 

Am I trying to do too much? Should I just suck it up and run a premade campaign?

*Edit: OK, in the last 20 minutes I've decided not to run my first campaign on the world I'm building - don't really want to ruin a perfectly good world by bad-DMing - but I'm still reluctant to cut on the creative part of the experience.*

2) Leveling.

I've searched around on the sub and got some ideas, but I'm still having some issues.

I think it would be interesting to reward individual play, bonuses for good roleplaying, thinking outside of the box and such, and I feel like using some sort of an experience system would work best (even if I'm the only one to keep track of it - I'm still deciding on that).

However, I feel like these kinds of things would be detrimental to characters that are inherently combat-oriented (what comes to mind is the classic stupid barbarian). It seems to me that these characters would be at a disadvantage when compared to other characters, since there would be less oportunities for them to individually stand out (unless I also hand out experience for combat individually, but that seems excessively complicated).

What do you guys think?
I second *Discworld* and *The King Killer Chronicles*.

Also, depending on the reasoning against vampires (overuse, perhaps?) you should definetely check out *Carpe Jugulum*, from the Discworld series. 

It's from 1998, so it doesn't really enter into the recent vampire shenanigans, but it's a great satire on vampires, with all the genius of Terry Pratchett at work.
*The Expanse* series, by  James S.A. Corey. 

Seriously, I'm not even that much into sci-fy, but I just read the first one, *Leviathan Wakes* and it's just amazing.
You could try the *Discworld* series, from Terry Prattchet, if you like fantasy, or the *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* series, by Douglas Adams, if you're into sci-fy.

Both are genius satires of their genres and of life itself, guaranteed to put a smile on anyone's face.
I actually bought this book on a whim months ago, and never got around to reading it. Might check it out soon.
If you liked the first, go get the second. It follows the same path of the first, and I honestly can't wait for the last one.
I'd say the Song of Ice and Fire series kind of fits what you're going for.

While magic is slowly gaining a larger part in the series, it is mostly regarded as a myth or a long forgotten art.
**Good Omens, by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett**
It would be pretty awesome if the party fought its way down just to find out that the people being tortured actually want to be there.

More to the point of the post, I like to think of the major events happening in the world, which might be influenced by the party, if they so desire.

I feel like it's easier to think in a larger scale than going step by step. If you know what's happening in the world, it's easier to think about what might be happening locally.

I think u/merryhob 's idea is a great starting point. Assuming that there's a current conflict between two gods, the party might find something in the dungeon that hints at the cult's plans.

Why are they doing what they're doing? Maybe there is a sudden increase in worship in order to "fuel" the gods power for such conflict, in which case they might simply find an order from the high priest telling them to gather followers, whatever the cost. That might spice their interest to search for whatever the cult is doing.

You could also think about the conflict itself - it could range anywhere from an all out holy war to a simple bet between the two (gods are strange beings).

If you want to throw them a curveball, you could always make Loviatar be the "good" path to follow, which Ilmater is trying to disrupt for whatever reason. Maybe there is an all out war between the gods, and they are at opposite sides, with Ilmater's planning to end the world as they know it (this would obviously take some working out). In this case, all the torturing might be a necessary evil.

Sorry if I wasn't too clear, I started throwing ideas as they came to me, but my phone isn't really helping out.
To be completely clear on this, the main reason I support Sanders are his views on civil rights and individual liberties.

No one's promoting soviet-like socialism. I also do not believe the government should support people who *chose* not to do anything.

What I want is for all people to be free to do what they understand is best, as long as that does not interfere with other people's own freedom.

People should not be dying for any reason other than old age or incurable diseases, and people should be educated enough to be able to make their own choices - this way, everyone can be free.

The extremely poor, today, don't have real freedom - they are forced to subject themselves to whatever means necessary to sustain themselves and their families.

You can't possibly believe that America is fine the way it is today, and no other candidates seem to bring actual positive changes for society.
I can't believe I'm getting into this, but ok.

I just have this crazy idea that people who are starving to death shouldn't be starving to death.

You know, maybe the country could stop spending all its money on developing and maintaining ways of killing people and use it to keep their citizens alive.
Anakin Skywalker (from the prequels).

Seriously, what a shitty character. He's selfish, way too proud for his own good, stupid beyond measure - I hated the way they made his fall to the dark side so much the movie I hate the least from the prequels is episode I, even with Jar Jar fucking Binks.

Seriously, Jar Jar isn't nearly as bad as Anakin speaking about fucking sand or deciding to kill all the young jedi in order to save Padmé, and then proceeding to almost choke her to death.

Fuck, I hate Anakin so much.
I think it's not so much as replicating the Scandinavian countries and more that he's honestly the only candidate with reasonable views on how a 21st century society should treat people.
How do you sleep at night?
The option with choices I'd make usually fucks everything up from the locked full paragon/renegade options D:
You should totally send me that when its done.
*Saving it for later use.*

This is pretty good, though I actually like the whole "roll for initiative" thing - I love the transition into combat, with initiative rolls and the start of "combat music".

It will work wonders for pre-rolling set encounters and just keeping track of it all, though.
"Sexy Uncle Mike"

"Someone's Dog"

This is wonderful
I get the idea, but if I saw a paragon prompt at that moment I would think that it might give me a chance to salvage the situation.
The first scene from ME1, with the music building up to the MASS EFFECT title, is one of my favorite soundtrack moments of all time.

I get shivers just thinking about it.
Maybe so, but imagine seeing the paragon icon pop up, seeing a glimmer of hope, and then triggering it just to watch you shooting Wrex.

I would shut the game down and back away instantly.
This - I feel hurt from even imagining it.

I've been meaning to do a full renegade playthrough, but I always stop when I begin imagining actually killing my friends.

I mean, learning that it was possible for Tali to fucking kill herself on ME3 made me be insanely thorough on my playthroughs, to make sure that NEVER happens to me.
There are some things that got left out of the movie, which I thought were quite interesting, such as the rest of the story of Johny Fontane.

The main story is pretty much what's on the movie, though.

You might also try Omertà, also by Mario Puzo.
Might be an obvious one, but have you read The Godfather, by Mario Puzo?
**Good Omens, by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett**

Long time fan of Pratchett and with an ever-increasing admiration of Gaiman, it honestly took me too long to get to Good Omens. 

I'm only a few chapters in, but I can already see that I'm going to love this book.
I don't really love Ashley as a character, either - though I've quite liked the romance with Kaiden on ME1, even though I've never been a big fan of him.

Liara and Tali <3
Some of my friends insist on telling me that they could enjoy ME2 and 3 perfectly without having played ME1. 

They have no idea of how much of the experience is lost when you skip the first game.
It's also going to be the first time I play ME3 after romancing Garrus - people seem to be very fond of it, so I thought I should give it a shot.
They were all on sale on PSN not too long ago.

I've actually got the trilogy and all the story-related DLC on my PS3 for like 30$.
I'm actually romancing Kaiden in ME1 for the first time right now, and I got a bit freaked out at how much telling Liara that I don't see her as a lover bothered me.

I'll still romance Garrus on ME2, though.
My thoughts exactly.
As someone currently playing a bard who by these conditions has royally screwed up his reputation on the city he's in - having failed his first 2 or 3 performances and being currently arrested for murder (even though it was in self defense) -, I might avoid showing this to the DM for the time being.

It is an amazing resource, though, and it makes me seriously rethink the way I've been playing as a bard.
Is it weird that I'm thinking about it?
Yeah, right? What's the point of fashion hunting if your weapon is not included?
But it's the MASTER SWORD. If it is possible for it to be useful at all, I'm making it happen. 
I actually have no problems with Khezu. My brain just seems to shut down against gypceros. 
Crit failed my deception roll D:
You could try any of Bernard Cornwell' series, if you're into historical romance (The Warlord Chronicles, The Grail Quest, The Saxon Stories, just to name a few).

If you're into fantasy at all, A Song of Ice and Fire is a mandatory recommendation (be prepared to go crazy waiting for the next book, but the wait is worth it).
Yeah, I got the Rathian one, but was holding off on the Rath, mostly because I didn't want to spend the materials and because I want the Master Sword as my main end game fire SnS (because Zelda, duh).
I almost certainly have enough materials to craft the Rathalos SnS - I'll burn that asshole to the ground.

And after I'm done with him, I'll kill him again with my HBG just so he knows I could have killed him at any time, but wanted the challenge.
I feel like it all boils down to purchasing power.

~~I understand the issue with copper, silver and electrum becoming irrelevant, but the point is that most "relevant" things cost dozens, hundreds or even thousands of gold, so players simply won't~~

Ok, nevermind, I just changed my mind as I was writing this. I just think the situation should be made clear to the players, but, if they're up for it, it could work amazingly.

Thinking about it, a bunch of lvl 1 scrubs should be mostly nobodies in that world, people still *trying* to make their names in the world.

So it would make sense for them to gain what seems like scraps, at least for the first few sessions, before they actually get hired for better-paying quests.

In my recent games, I've always felt that people don't *care* enough about their characters - witnessing and feeling the characters *grow* would be a great way to get attached to them.
Truth be told, I have yet to DM my first session. I have one game going on, but as a player, and it's hard enough to keep that one going.

DnD BTS has made me get really excited about world building and *really* wanting to start DMing - I have quite a few ideas that I'm putting to paper whenever I have some time available.

I feel like this sub is not only a great source of information, but also a great way of seeing how other people think and react to different ideas and situations.

It has really broadened my mind, so all I can say is *thank you very much*.
>Weak to fire.

*Proceeds to craft Rathalos SnS.*

I'll burn the shit out of him.
I'm using SnS, so I'm blocking the flashes - that part was more of a general rant.

What pisses me off is that he doesn't ever stop, and when he stops, I get hit by his tail. I hate him so much. 

I did. Already killed vendrick, too. 
I'm still working on the design - I want to have the relay itself not unlike your own, but with the energy coming from it in blue.

I'm also still looking around for the perfect artist (it's actually going to be my 1st tattoo) for it.

I'm not in too much of a hurry, though, since I still have to save up money for it.
In no specific order:

Best: Garrus, Wrex, Tali, Liara, Mordin/Legion (can't pick one)

Worst: Jacob, Ashley, Kaiden, Vega.

Can't really think of a 5th one I don't like (maaaaaaybe samara)
Arrival was at full price when I checked 
My personal favorite is Medieval: Total War (the first one), but they are all pretty good (except for Rome II, maybe).
My 3 favorite series, by far, are Mass Effect, Soulsborne and Zelda.

Also high on the list: Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Fallout.

I also loved Dragon Age Inquisition and Persona 3, but I still haven't had the time to play the other games of the series.
It looks great!

Which actually makes me feel A LOT better the Mass Relay one I've been meaning to get.
Before getting in on my current job, I couldn't get enough books.

Now I'm hoping I can finish at least 1 every month.
This is a great idea.

I'm kind of terrified at how few books I've read last year, so I'm getting into any new push to reading.

I've read "The Masque of the Red Death" a long time ago, but can't really remember much about it, so I'll get over it again when I get home.

Edit: on the format - I think one book a month would be ideal. I don't have too much time for reading, and setting it at one book every week would effectively stop me from reading anything else.
Can I still fight Aldia after beating Nashandra and sitting at the throne? Or do I have to do everything again on NG+? 

Because seriously, there is no way the journey is worth it.
While I do agree that you should always be *willing* to kill the players, you shouldn't be actively trying to do it.

The game should always be challenging, but I feel like death should come from stupid and/or careless decisions (or extremely bad luck) - the players shouldn't generally face impossible odds.

I haven't really had this issue, but my brother frequently DM's for other groups, and he has told me many times about how frequently people die on his campaigns, and I frequently challenge what happened - I feel like the only reason players should ever die on the first few sessions of a campaign is if they royally screw up.

Then again, I try to make death be as relevant as possible - ressurection is not a simple option. There will always be consequences from dying.
I'm usually listening to some kind of music at all times, unless I'm talking to someone or sleeping (and even then, sometimes).

Edit: on my thoughts on the article: I don't really use the music as "soundtrack" to the books, so it doens't really make much of a difference to me. Music mostly helps me disconnect from everything else and focus on what I'm doing.
I use it mostly for keeping track of the books I read (which is something I forget, sometimes - I frequently find books I've already read on the recommended sections). 

I also use it to look around for random recommendations - though I'll only check it out if it's rated more than 4 stars.


This. Anything lower than 4 stars is probably not worth the risk of going in blind.
Sure, why not.

I'm at caravan 7/HR 5. 
I did not, and that does seem interesting.

My plan with SotFS was to platinum the game, doing every single thing I could. However, as I got to the end I did the crown of the sunken king and didnt really like it too much (just like a good chunk of the main game), so I decided to just get it over with and kill the final boss.

I might come back to it eventually - it feels wrong not having a platinum trophy of a soulsborne game.
It just felt irrelevant to the story. Tbh, by the time I got to the ending, I just wanted to get over it so I could say I had at least beaten DS2 (I got the platinum on the other 3).

However, it should be made clear that this is my personal opinion, and that I know a lot of people who loved the game, even more than DS1 (which is insane, but whatever).
I had a lot of trouble with him before learning I could just keep parrying him and punching him to death.

Then I put on full Havel's and iron skin and slashed him to pieces.
