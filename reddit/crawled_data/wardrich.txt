Glad you were able to find your home again!

It's gone now.

cr.app is still available, though.
Yeah, most of it is pretty gory... I'll update my post.
Just what we all wanted! More bloatware!
Is it hard to find? I have to use Messages because my Gear2 won't work with anything else... really shitty that they locked the watch down like that.

The last update on that post you linked to was from last year?  Where's the updated info
Have you tried asking the developers if the soundtrack is available anywhere?

Depending on the licensing of the music, this could potentially be a piracy request.  I'm going to remove it for now... if the devs tell you it's okay to get the soundtrack, I guess you can post back in here again asking for help, but we'll need proof that they're okay with you getting the music.

The things we can do thanks to medical science is nuts.  And to be able to see a baby in that form is almost surreal.  To see the baby go from breathing the fluid to breathing air, etc.
It's a content aggregator, not a social network.

The site focuses on stories grouped by community.  Not around what people are doing.
/r/oldschoolcoolnsfw is kinda neat.
She looked like trouble
Pretty gory shit, but it's nice to see we can fuck ourselves up pretty good and still be able to recover thanks to medical sciences.

[The baby getting cut out of the amniotic sac](https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalGore/comments/8g2fqk/surgeons_manually_removing_a_baby_from_its/) is one of the neatest things I've seen.
Right?  PCIE sounds like a downgrade.  I mean, we had AGP which was separate from PCI.  Why would I want to jam my video card back into a PCI slot?
That post is only a month old.  This push to become another shit site has been obvious for about a year now...

And I hope when it happens the get crushed.  Maybe somebody else will be able to set up a similar site. Maybe we'll all just push over to visit. Who knows.

Investors are morons, and they're going to ruin yet another great thing with their shortsighted, out of touch bean counting.

Oh hey, I have this case.  When my kids were younger, one of them decided to put a Freezie on the top, and it melted in and fucked up my video card.  Lucky everything else survived...  My cat also used to like to try and climb up there to sleep and I was always worried it would shed and fry my computer.


Not putting a removable plate under the grill is the dumbest shit ever.  How many people liquid cooled rigs?
This thread is worse than any onion cutting movie I've ever seen...
As long as these MPs ask better questions than the Senators...
Maybe.  Never really got into it.  Gotta think more about what to do with each nightmare.
What's the trick to winning?
Tbh, it kinda sounds boring off the hop lol.  I've never really been much of a fan of Yahtzee, tho.
A lot of the games I've bought IRL I played in app form first.  It's a great way to understand the rules etc.
At least you can cheat to win in the boxed version.  👍🏻
I agree there... They should make it easier to filter through your personal library of apps.

If Google made a way to even just export your entire list of apps to a flat file, I'd make an app that could filter and categorize them.  Maybe have the data stored in a cloud so there could be community-based auto categorizing.
You're twisting my arm... Lol. 

I'll check it out on YouTube and then inevitably cave and buy it.
Sucks that the game flopped.  There's a lot of potential to turn it into an actually half decent game... But that would require more effort than something you'd sell at Target lol
Apparently the curling cards is a big issue... A lot of posts on BGG and stuff about it.  Might be specific to the tin, not sure.
I'm disappointed that it ended so soon... Did he end up sanding himself?
Laminate them and you're good.
The rules are determined by the cards, and that's part of the fun because you can wind up fucking yourself over if you have to play a card and it either makes you all lose, or sets a win event that has all the criteria that somebody else met.

I've only played the Zombie version, so maybe it adds some extras that makes it fun?  I dunno.  It's easy to learn and fun to play if you want something quick to do.
[Please see this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/8g50va/favorite_horizontal_or_onehanded_games/).  It was submitted shortly before you, and is practically requesting the same thing.
I listed Exploding Kittens as one of my leas fave games.  I fucking hate everything about it lol.  It's like they mashed Go Fish and Old Maid together, then added some shit powerups.  The whole game is just a box of disappointment.
Fuck, I was browsing the thread and I was about ready to say I 100% agree with this guy and have a good ol' circlejerk of hatred... then I realized I'd made it down to my own post.  Whoops!
Don't feel bad.  I actually enjoyed the game, though I've only played it a few times... then all my cards curled in the fucking tin and I haven't had the time to flatten them back out again.
I didn't even know there was a board game of Oregon Trail.
Ah man... Fluxx is such a great light-weight game.  One of the best things I've house-ruled is to start with a Draw 1, play 1, max hand size Unlimited.
Check out Caverna.  From what I understand, it's like Agricola, but more balanced and with more to do.
Won't this mean that the free version won't see any future updates to the game?
Why the hell did she put a hit on herself?
The box and pictures make it look pretty fun
You got ripped off.
Holy shit is that game ever cringey.
I have a lot of fond memories of playing this with my family at the cottage they used to have.  I don't know if I'd actually appreciate the game if it weren't for the sentiment I have with it.
I was 50/50 on this one.  The box looked neat, but I have no idea how the game plays out.  Somebody else called this game out (maybe it was you?) a while ago in another thread talking about games that have the shittiest scoring systems.
Reminds me a whole lot of Exploding Kittens.
Exactly!  My only gripe is that the "end game" takes too long.  I almost want to house-rule that the game ends if a person has held the middle spot of the board for X number of turns.  I like that it gives the other players a chance to usurp the apparent winner, but I feel it just makes people resent the eachother lol
I have a copy of **FUSE**.  I can't remember where I got it, though... Amazon maybe?

It's an interesting concept.  It's better if you look at it more as a co-operative puzzle than as a game.
I got the Android verison of **Onirim** for free a while back.  It's frustrating beyond belief and I'm not even sure if it's something you can beat.  I'd probably consider a physical copy only because I could cheat my way through it to eventually see just how much luck would be involved in winning a game.

The game is stacked so hard against you right from the get-go.  I suppose it's a good choice for a game if you're just tired of winning and want to feel what it's like to lose haha
Never even heard of it... what's the concept behind it? The box looks kinda fun, but the flipbook it comes with has me worried about technicalities and a dumptruck of rules
How does that even work?  I have the Android version of the regular board game and it's tons of fun... but I have no idea how you could convert that down to a dice game
You probably shouldn't have been playing it with your grandparents /s
Monopoly Deal was such a surprisingly fun game.  I'm not sure how it stands up now that I've been introduced to so many other games... but I played the shit out of it like 8 years ago at one of my past jobs.
I've never actually seen this one... what's it about?  What's wrong with it?
I don't mind Dominion.  The only thing that sucks is when the cards in the reserve are all shit and there's no way to get a good machine going out of it lol.
I only got to play this game like once... then all of my cards curled and I haven't been bothered to flatten them back out.

The game seemed fairly fun, though.
Oh no... my wife has been eyeing this game for a while and I told her we'll have to get it next.

What is it that you guys hated about it?
**CATAN** Because something needs to be on top of the nicer games to collect all the dust.
I kinda like it :(  It's expensive AF, but it's the best (maybe the only) hack-and-slash RPG of a board game I've ever played.
**Sushi Go**.  I hate everything about it.  It seems way too light and luck based.  I still own it because technically it's my wife's.

**Exploding Kittens** was one of the biggest disappointments I've had.  There was so much hype behind it... turns out it's just a glorified Kalvinball of cards that mixes Go Fish with Old Maid.  I still have it because it's actually my son's game.
Is this game as confusing, involved, and technical as it looks?  I've been really turned off of it just on how complex it all looks... which is maybe a strange thing for me to say with Castles of Mad King Ludwig and Caverna being some of my top games...

Guess I should hit up YouTube sometime and find a proper demo video of the game.
I get the attachment.  Your mind is projecting the whole thing, so I'm sure it would also attach feeling to it as well.  It's kind of neat in a way... like your brain has gone half sentient.

You are able to create imaginary objects in space that you can interact with in some way.  They have personalities, voices, appearances... all entirely made up.  I can only imagine how hard it would be to live with this, but as an outsider I also find it incredibly fascinating just how much our minds are capable of doing.

Answering machines don't hound you with a stupid notification that you can't remove because you deleted all of your pending messages, but didn't log out of the system before you hung up.
It's come to the point where any time a man tries to explain something to a woman, it's mansplaining.
It's almost like the word they're looking for is "explaining" but they're too close-minded to consider that maybe they're wrong, so they just coined a term to use to brush it all off and feign ignorance.
Wish you kept it on the finished piece for more than .0000005 seconds, but it's good otherwise lol

The real irony is that the guy that took this video likely did it on his phone.

Amazing!  I can't believe me and my cronies never thought of this one.  It sounds like the perfect blend of stupid, fun, and funny.
I remember playing this a ton... but now I can't remember how it works :(  Something about a 2x2 grid of squares.  One person per square.  And bouncing a basketball... but I can't remember the main rules :(
Good to know.  I've been using Vanced for a while - didn't realize that iYTBP had died.  I only mentioned iYTBP because it used to be the main version of the program
iYTBP and Vanced aren't available in the store... They break a crapton of rules lol.  You have to grab them from XDA.
> I don't know what to make of it

I find it really interesting that, while you're aware of your condition and that these entities are total figments of your mind, you still feel a desire to make something of them.

I don't mean to sound cold, I'm actually incredibly curious and interested about this... so you know these two visions appear randomly, and that you're the only one to experience them.  Why do you feel there is significance to them?  Would it be possible to learn to just ignore them?  The visions themselves can't harm you, but you could in turn harm yourself by trying to respond to them.

iYTBP/Vanced literally gives you the embedded Red background playback, as well as a ton of other bandwidth and quality options.

It's all the features of YouTube with a few bonuses sprinkled in.

NewPipe I guess is okay if all you do is search stuff on a whim.  But if you deal with subscriptions, notifications, and playlists, it's garbage.
NewPipe was terrible for me...  I binge my Watch Later list and frequently action notifications to my watch later.

NewPipe didn't support this (or my other playlists) at all.

~~iYTBP~~ Youtube Vanced on Android FTW

Talked with a fleet driver some years ago when this started to become a thing.

His tire blew out, and since it was a fleet vehicle, he had to get it towed many stated away to the factory to have it assessed etc.

He was fucking pissed, and for good reason.

Can't tell from the game description... is it an Idle RPG?
There's really no need to use anything other than Retroarch.  You can pull in emulation cores for whatever systems you want, and it has a pretty good front-end for selecting your ROMs.

It does require a bit of setup to get going, though

They never said they had the lowest prices, only that they always had low prices.  They never even said that applied to everything in the store.

Considering nobody noticed the lack of high-end spectrum, I don't think it's all that big of a deal. But plus the box never mentioned anything about a tweeter.

Too bad nobody was around to give your parents that sweet LPT.  Breeding is not necessarily something stupid... And (at least in the case of /r/childfree) you're looking at a massively biased group of people that can't handle having kids and can't seem to comprehend that other people can handle having them... Then use shit parents as their case study proof into why having kids is a bad idea.

Also, kids was just an example.  There are certainly other situations that could cause this:

- Simply having it in your pocket (apparently, judging by OPs story)

- Typical end users fucking up their pin that they somehow managed to forget after a weekend of not using their phone

- your friend accidentally grabbing the wrong phone and trying 10 times to sign in because they're drunk or just dumb

- trying to unlock your phone while driving because you can't handle the thought of driving without using your phone

I mean, I'm not Asian but it's usually pretty easy to tell the difference between a Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, and a Filipino.

I find Chinese and Japanese are a bit tougher to discern, though.

As for caucasians, I'd say it's easy to pick out a rough region.  Maybe down to a specific area within the continent, but to give a specific European country I'd probably be fucked, or try to pick out an American from a Canadian... That might be tricky, too.

I'm confused... Why would Facebook have to read a ToS?  The app is only taking what Facebook's API gives to it, right?

Facebook would be slapping Cambridge Analytics with a ToS to use the FB API.

I'm not sure how I can make a better analogy to this... But CA sending FB a ToS seems backwards.

I messed up the paths in my post, but basically it handles the files that are stored in the sections that are only accessible with root access.

It's usually not too hard to manually clean up the internal and SD storage on your own once and a while... the folders that shouldn't belong are pretty easy to find.

How does region locking work in the first place?  Like, why did they bother region locking it on GP, and then telling everybody to just download the APK externally?  Why not just make it globally available in the store in the first place?
Just wanted to follow up.  The mods are all in agreement that the removal was fair.

We encourage you to create a new post along the same lines as this, but re-form it to either fit the requirements for a proper request thread, or a discussion-based thread about what makes the best co-op game.

If you do choose to go the route of a request thread, please keep these rules in mind:

---

6.1 Requests must start with [Request]. Posts that are not flaired will be removed.

6.2 All requests must have a detailed description, with at least three key points you're looking for in a game. Examples:

    Features you want/don't want to see (MUST)
    Genre
    Paid or Free
    Single or Multiplayer
    Playable Offline

6.3 Topics must be searched before posting. In your post, describe in detail how your search did not satisfy your request.

Good call... It's been a while since I've been on my rooted phone.  I had a feeling I botched the name.

It'd be nice if Android installers kept some sort of tabs on the folders that the apps created.  I'm not sure how it could do that, though
I ended up writing them in their site and they mailed me out an entire new bag of marbles.

The quality of the replacements sucked too, but it was a different colour that sucked... So between the two, I had a full and half decent set.

I'm also gonna stay away from their games for a bit...  The price does not justify what I got.
Depends on the device, really.

I rooted my S2 and my S5.  No regrets.  He, my S5 is running a more up-to-date version of Android than my S8+.

I'm not sure if I will end up rooting my S8+, though... It'll break its ability to pair with thr Gear2 watchvI was given.

There's no way to know if you rated at all... Just hit the link, give them 1 star, and enjoy getting datamined into oblivion with those permissions.
That motion tracking and everything... It's so smooth and so damn near perfect.

How long do you figure this took to do?!
If you're on Android, I'd suggest Boost.  I've tried all the other ones, and aside from the somewhat shitty ads, Boost has been the way to go.  There is an IAP to remove ads (or you could nuke them with an adblocker).  The developer is really active and responsive to suggestions and feedback, too.

Searching subreddits, searching users, viewing your profile, going from one specific sub to another, getting to your mail, content filtering settings, lacking themes and styles, unintuitive layout...

In not sure what options you get on iOS, but the official app is one of the worst to use on Android.  It's incredibly unintuitive and limited. 
Amazing!  I love this guy's videos.  I've used them religiously to both reaffirm what I've read when I read the manual for a new game, and as a way to review games that I'm interested in buying.
> "They said that they can't do anything about it. You have to take it up with your insurance company or whatever you want to do. No help at all."

Shouldn't it be on the Valet company to ensure that their shit is locked up if the employee isn't there?  Seems like they could be hit with some sort of negligence charge.

I mean, what protection would the mark have if the con was wearing an outfit that matched the dress code and had an official looking ID?
Your first mistake is using the official Reddit app.
If you've ever driven on roads in Ontario, you'll see that a lot of them are under-rated as far as speed goes.  There are a LOT of 50-60 roads that should really be 80.

I thought it was just me at first, but I went on a trip to Florida a few years back, and the speed limits on the roads actually made sense... there were actually times I had to double check to make sure that I wasn't speeding.
Why was he bending the thing in the first place? I don't understand...
Did he not have the right of way?  There's no way that the Kia driver didn't see him coming.

It's been a while since I've done my tests, but I'm pretty sure U-Turns are illegal at any intersection.
A lot of our roads are ridiculously under-limit.  50-60 that really should be 80.

I went on a trip a few years ago to Florida, and it was great.  Roads were definitely gauged properly, and at times I actually had to double check to make sure that I wasn't speeding.  It was fantastic.
Agreed.  I'd say they're both equally at fault at best.  He was speeding, but the Kia turned into the wrong lane, and could have seen him coming and waited if they wanted to drive in the wrong lane like that.
They're both at fault.  OP was speeding, but they also went into the wrong lane.  They also should have been able to see OP's car speeding and know better than to try to make that turn.
I think it just uninstalls the stuff in the /android/app/app and /android/app/data folders.

The rest of the loose stuff that it puts on your internal memory stays as is and you'll have to manually remove it.
I had no idea Blondie has been running since the 30's.  I knew it from reading the Sunday comics as a kid in the 90's.  I don't think being able to identify Blondie is a way to date yourself, so you're good.
This was how I used to remember the spelling of "Wednesday" when I was a kid... lol

To me, it's a fine line because while you aren't outright requesting games, the discussion would be right in line with a typical request thread.

I'm going solely on the online communities that I've bumped into.  Just a bunch of incessant whining and bitching about "Chads" and how apparently the incels were wronged by not getting some sort of apparently owed sexual action from these girls... And so, all girls are worthless cunts.
100% worth it!  It's my new fave... Takes so long to set up and put away, though lol.

You should take a stab at doing a review.  I didn't realize I'd already mentioned it on YouTube lol.  Just grab a game off the shelf you think is underrated or maybe not as well known. 
What do you do?

> Reddit and r/incels radicalized him

By saying Reddit radicalized him, you're saying you personally had a part to do with this.

Do we blame the designer/landscaper of a park for radicalizing a rapist or murderer when a rape/murder happens in a park they built?

Do we blame an architect/builders for radicalizing robbers when a house they built got robbed?

Maybe /r/Incels did (or /r/braincels etc), but if you're going to blame Reddit as a whole, you basically drop the community down to the same level as that one small group of morons.

I don't think it's Reddit's job to do policing.  When it became a problem, Reddit banned /r/incels, and like any problem, they just regrouped into other subreddits.

I'm so fed up with people blaming a community as a whole for problems related to a small portion of it.  Every place you go to is going to have its idiots... we should be thankful that this place allows users to categorize themselves to make it easier to see who is what.

Except when they magically stop working just before some kind of questionable scenario plays out.

Oh hey!  Love your videos... Though your one about "not paying for what's in the box" kinda had the negative effect on me... I ended up researching Caverna... And the buying it.  Lol

Have you ever considered reviewing some of the games in your collection?  Or doing let's play videos on them?
It's a tough one to act on.

One one hand, I feel like the internet should be classified as a public space.  Site owners should not have to deeply moderate the spaces they create, much like you don't need to have a cop in every park listening to every conversation.  Reddit offers the ability to report posts, and Admins should have to come into play if a post reaches a certain threshold of reports, or hasn't been approved after X days if a report has been placed on it.

On the other hand, treating the internet like a public space would mean that we would probably lose what few rights to privacy and security that we currently have.

Their main hub got shut down, but a lot of them moved over to /r/braincels
They got shut down and now mostly hang around in the (ironically named) /r/braincels subreddit.
They literally blame everything on other people, instead of considering their own behaviour as the problem.
Oh hey, this is your game?  I played it a bit a few weeks ago - it's really fun, but I find the controls are a bit confusing... I can never tell if the row of dots is showing where the ball is being hit, or where the ball is going to go.
But I thought they were Nice Guys™

It's too bad that the media is going to spin this into a story about how bad the internet, 4chan, and reddit are... instead of just pointing out how stupid these people are...

Wouldn't that still allow you to just play and record a session off a keyboard?

I'm thinking of things like [FamiTracker](http://famitracker.com/) for NES, or [BoyScout](http://www.gbadev.org/tools.php?showinfo=187) for GBA
Ah! Thanks :D
Handheld systems, maybe.

What's the game to the left of Deja Vu?
No idea. Mine feels like a stick of butter, since the glass is so smooth.  And since it's all glass, if it does slip out of my hands, it's fucked.

I get that cases and skins are nice, but they shouldn't be a necessity.

Apparently premium means "huge design flaws"
You don't necessarily need old hardware to pull it off.  There are modern trackers, and some of them even emulate the sound chips of older devices.

Anybody can just push keyboard keys with a square wave tone...

But how many people are able to program out an entire tune?  That's fucking talent there.

You can get some pretty detailed stuff via the Weather Underground API.  I think your best bet would be to find an app that's using that data... or to dive in and try to create one yourself.  I built a tasker script, and it was surprisingly easy (and fun... but I'm a nerd).
Oh yeah! I see it now.  Neat!

I'm still trying to understand the hype behind video calling... I don't get it, but maybe that's because I'm ugly.
Was the game good?  That's kind of subjective and arguable.  I have a love/hate relationship with it, and some of the love may be my nostalgia blinders as I had this game as a kid.

The controls were god awful, and that made the game frustrating as hell.  You were trying to manipulate your snake using a standard DPAD.  There were multiple levels of depth that weren't always conveyed well.  And there was a timer.

The game started off all fun and innocent, but by about the third level you were ready to throw your controller through the NES.

The game does have a pretty stellar soundtrack by the legendary David Wise... and if you're with a game genie and a controller with a turbo button it's at least beatable and relatively enjoyable lol.
I appreciate your honesty.  lol
Man, you're lucky lol

Forced, unskippable tutorials are the new forced, unskippable cutscenes.
My comparison was giving an equally redundant command... I couldnt' think of anything else specific to Android.

That screenshot you posted - is it a stock Android feature?  Where is it hiding?
Is **I Am Level** a Spectrum port, or a brand new game inspired by speccy graphic limitations?
zpoop!
It's nice to have something that just quickly dumps caches and temp files, though.

You don't *have* to hit ctrl+shift+delete to clear your browsing history... you could find the location it stores its shit in, and dump it that way.  But it's nicer to have an interface that can just quickly do it for you.
While I have upgraded to an S8+, I still have my S5 which is doing a pretty good job.  It's running 8.1 whereas my 8+ is only running 8.0

The downside is that the S5 chews through 2 batteries a day.
Android Messages is great if you're one of the few with RCS.  I sadly had to swap to Samsung messages in order to get messages to work with my Gear2 watch.
I didn't even know about the "free parking" house rule until my teens. And it pissed me off so bad.

"It's called free parking because it's the only spot that doesn't have some sort of action associated with it.  It's not called 'take money meant for the bank'"
If you're playing by the proper rules, there's no way a game of Monopoly could last hours.  They should stop house ruling shit.
I knew that, but does it use the Buildbot to grab and update the cores?
Me?  You'll have to try again.
Is she a puppy or a baby?
Wouldn't it only fix the lag if the problem is with the emulator itself?  It's not going to speed up a poor controller, or a Bluetooth protocol error.

I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but it would be nice if they could put more emphasis on CRT emulation etc.
No doubt.  I'll have to see if there are any recordings of Abigail online.  Never even considered it being performed live.
I don't understand it.  Why do we want less input lag than the original system had?  I suppose it would allow us to ensure a consistent input lag that matches the console 100% of the time...

I was under the impression that the whole point of emulation was to provide a 1:1 recreation of the original experience.
That's pretty dope
It was actually an advert for coffee.
Ah thanks
What's fake about this?  She probably took as screenshot of it when it happened...
They're trying to turn it into a social network, too.  That will be the end of Reddit.

If I'm holding it by the sides it isn't too bad, but trying to hold it by the back/screen?  It's not happening.

Well that's a problem... Because Reddit is a content aggregator.  It is discussions based around topics, sorted by categories.

Social networks are gossip about people and need filtered by circles of friends.

I'm not too sure how Reddit is going to survive as a social network... They would have been better off creating a totally different website and community.

I might as well just go back to Digg, Slashdot, and Del.icio.us
That's actually pretty funny and technically correct.
TBF, Hydrox is the OG.  Oreo is the ripoff.

They got store-brand Chocolate stuffed cookies.
Calm down now, Rodd Flanders.  Lol
There's a good chance the daughter made the comment.  It's a fair statement from the kid.

Unfortunately the mom also decided to act like a kid and make the tweet as if the all-male staff was a bad thing.

Fortunately, some guy saw the comment and was able to make a solid, snarky reply to it.
Yes, it's almost as if it's a twitter post... Where the top tweet is a response to the quoted tweet in the frame at the bottom.

It's almost like this guy was making a sarcastic comment to point out it how ridiculous the person he replied to sounded.
Apparently twitter is hard... Lol
My dentist is a male.  He does great work.

The hygienists are all female.  They also do great work.

It's almost like job performance hasn't anything to do with gender.

100% you could tell they were all socially awkward.  Making a public spectacle?  No idea what he was expecting.
That guy looks strikingly familiar... But I can't place who he reminds me of.
What's the new Reddit look like?  I'm almost afraid to see it, seeing how the completely screwed up the user pages by making social network-esque profile pages...
Why would we want this, though?  Isn't the point of emulation to relive the nostalgia as accurately as possible?

I suppose this could allow for some interesting experiences, though.
With my luck, it'll be /r/gmilfscat [I hope this doesn't exist] and my Reddit will be full of shittin' grannies...  🤢🤢🤢

Spicy pasta is a gift from the gods.

Why do people keep buying this shit?,  If they want the problem fixed, they should probably stop handing the company money.
That's kinda cute.... And good on your mom
There are some basic truths in those points, though.

IIRC, a messed up thyroid means a messed up metabolism, and cutting out carbs throws your body into ketosis which makes it run on fat instead of carbs.  I could be falling for shenanigans, though...
I've never seen pizza called "flatbread" before... And if I did, I'd just make fun of it, but in the wrong way "what are my choices?  Flat bread or pizza dough?"

Firefox takes it to the next level:

- Ctrl+enter = www. .com

- Ctrl+shift+enter = www. .org
First they need to know when to use "I" vs when to use "me" in a sentence simply talking about themself.

Ie: would you say "I go to the store" or "Me go to the store"

Basically, they need to know how to not sound like a caveman lol

Once they've got that down, you just keep following the same rule... "Sally and I go to the store"  If you drop the "Sally and" part, and the sentence doesn't make sense, you've used the wrong one.

I especially hate people that don't bother using it to change lanes, and then turn it on about a car or two from the intersection.

Like okay, use it when you're in the one lane where your only fucking option is to turn... And just assume that we're all god damn mind readers the rest of the time... Yeah, ok buddy.
This is where I draw the line.  I think I use the right form almost all of the time, but honestly, I'm just ~~whinging~~ winging it.

We should just adopt the word "æffect" as an all-encompassing word.

If it's just your SSN, then yeah, they copied it.

However, if they begin to file paperwork and such as you, then they have effectively stolen your identity as they now have control over it.

> Such that intentionally accessing a computer without authorisation or exceeds your authorised access, is an offence.

What about cases where no authorization is needed?  He was never prompted to enter credentials.  He just flipped to the next page of the book and now he's getting fucked for it.

>  But if you intentionally modify a URL to gain access to information the websites UI does not allow you to see, 

So by me manually entering "https://www.google.ca/search?q=dogs" and then "https://www.google.ca/search?q=funny+dogs" I could be breaking the law?

> and you use this method to extract huge buckets of information, then your intentions might not be lawful. 

They might be, they might not be.  That's up to the courts to decide... but I'm pretty sure this kids intention was just to build a web scraper and save the pages.  Maybe flip through them to see what he could see, but is that really any different from flipping through a dirty magazine you found to see what you could find?
Except there was no door.  If you want to make a building analogy, they were all in the same room.

Also, nothing was stolen as the original records are still there, their URL's still valid.  Copying is not the same as stealing.
They left a book out in a publicly accessible building.

Somebody walked in and photocopied a few of the pages.

The physical book is still there, so nothing was stolen.  
The The book was in a public space, so nothing was broken into.

Literally, no law was broken.
Wait a sec, that's not how you spell "assholes" lol
🐛🐛
You're a fucking twit if you don't think for a second that you'd contemplate doing the same thing after reaching your breaking time.

It takes a LOT to be able to be a caretaker for someone.  Especially for the rest of your life.

I'm not saying the guy isn't in a bad spot, but is being stuck in a spot being cared for by somebody that can't physically or mentally handle it any more be any better?  I doubt it.
Android Messages is the way to go if you can take advantage of RCS.  Otherwise, I'd suggest Textra
Also - mad respect to you to be able to make that commitment.
That's fair.  If I were in the position and my wife left me, I'd be upset but underwriting.  Maybe because I have a good family and know I wouldn't be left high and dry.
Absolutely agree.

Lots of quickfire repsonses in here without actually taking the time to consider how life changing this is.  The amount that a person would have to give up is phenomenal.

A lot of people in here seem to think she'd be able to drop everything to care for herself and him... And somehow still be able to bring in enough money for them.

They're also forgetting just how long a good marriage should last.

A lifetime of that would be incredibly taxing on anybody.  And to do it without a solid job at the same time?  Good luck.
When is she supposed to find time to work and bring in money?
Just remember you'd be doing this with very little money, as you'd have to quit your job and live on whatever assistance is out there.
So you're telling me that you'd be willing to quit your job, and drop everything to take care of your wife for the rest of your lives to do absolutely everything for her?  Feed her, clothe her, bathe her, help her in the bathroom, etc.

There is no longer a her, or an is.  Just a you.  That's a huge commitment that I don't think people consider when getting married.

It sucks for everybody in that situation, and I don't think there are nearly as many strong and commited people out there as they think.
Not only is he no longer able to contribute, but now she has to contribute for her, them, and him, and for the rest of their lives.

I would bet a lot of money that 90% of the peope in here wouldn't be able to handle this... And they probably wouldn't last even close to three years 
The thanks he got was her being with him for three years trying to make it work.

Three years of her having to potentially give up everything - including her job.

Three years of having to feed him hydrate him.

Three years of having to bathe him.

Three years of having to help him in the bathroom.

Three years of dropping everything to help him.


Could you handle all that?  And for the rest of your life?

There's an awful lot of armchair warrioring going on in here, and it's fucking dumb.
So you're saying that if your wife got beat to that level, that you would spend potentially 50+, years doing everything for her?  I find that hard to believe.  I don't think anybody in here understands the amount of work and stress involved in having to care for somebody that can't do anything on their own.
How long would it take him to dump her in that state?  It's a life-changing commitment to have to tend to somebody in his state.

Neither of them went into the relationship expecting to have to care for the other like that, and for that long.
Agreed.  She stayed with him for three years.  It sounds like she tried her best to make it work.
What's with the circlejerk in here?  I can empath with her in this situation.  That's a LOT of weight to have to take on.  While I understand the contractual obligation of "til death due us part" how many if us would be able to spend 50 years with a wife in that state?

- You'd quite possibly have to quit your job.
- you'd have to drop everything all the time to tend to your spouse
- your social life would be almost nonexistent
- your days would be long and tiring
- your sleep would be very broken

This woman has been with the guy in this state for three years.  It sounds like she has tried to make it work.

I really hope they caught the fuckers that did this and gave them due justice.

Yeah, it sucks for the guy.  Yeah, he risked his Life for her.  Who knows where he'll end up because of this... But who knows how knows how his life would be if he's stuck being cared for by somebody that doesn't care for him anymore.
It really blows my mind just how fast data can travel.  I mean, consider the distance it goes, then comes back... And all in the blink of an eye.  It's nuts.

I got a good chuckle to myself here, because it reminded me of diluting a drink with water... only with porn and vaginas.

/u/shadohunter3321 - While this post doesn't explicitly go against any of our rules here, it does go against some of our core values.

I love tinkering with apps and learning more about how they work - it's a great way to learn and a great way to understand how to make things better so you don't fall into the same traps; however the problem arises when the values being hacked counter the need to purchase IAP's, which in the end hurts the app developer.  I hate IAP myself, but I get that a person's gotta eat.

With this in mind, I've removed the post, but I don't want you to be discouraged from being a member of our community.  I hope you understand.
Hey man, I get you're super passionate about this... but could I ask you to dial it back a bit, please?  The point you're making is being overshadowed by the aggression.
Seems sketchy to me that the game refuses to work w/o that permission.

From what I understand, it's generally requested so that the game can pause itself if a call comes in.

I would avoid ES if you can.  It's pretty close to being malware at this point.  There have been reports of it calling home, and it's got a lot of unnecessary bloat.  There are better alternatives like Solid Explorer or MiXplorer (XDA) to name a couple.
I'd ditch ES... It's been really sketchy for a few years now.  Bloatware and calling home.

I'd find a better alternative.

Exactly.  I can't understand the price of iOS when compared to its lack of functioning like the pocket sized PC that it is.

That's a huge plus on Android. This phone is literally a pocket computer.
I'm still feeling this way... I upgraded from a 16 gig S5 to a 64 gig S8.  I'm running out of stuff to install on it.  I literally have too many games to play. I spend so much time trying to make up my mind.

It's amazing.
They are literally charging the kid for doing the equivalent of walking into a publicly accessible area of a building, then making photocopies of documents that were being stored on a shelf.

Why are they doing this?  It doesn't seem nearly as efficient as the current card stack where you can see several windows in one go.  If I wanted inefficient Apple experiences, I'd switch to iOS.  What's with this trend of Android ripping off Apple ideas everywhere?
True. This is more something that's just impossible to rationalize as a kid.

I personally wonder if it has anything at all to do with how mundane your schedule becomes as an adult - one day literally blurs into the next.  As kids, we had different classes each day at different times, and homework, etc.  As adults, we have the same job 5 days a week.
Thanks!  If you do have any suggestions at any time, feel free to let me know.
Sweet!  I'll have to check this out later!

Sadly, this subreddit never caught on :(  Maybe one day...
Suggestion time!

1. Shrinking the headers down should bring them to a 2-line display that shows the progress bar, the toggle switch, and the buy button

2. The On/Off switch doesn't make sense yet... are you planning on eventually adding a power aspect to the game?  Too much power consumption = slower production?

3. Don't let people buy resources until they have bought the first printer.  You can lose before you even get started if you're dumb enough lol
Acceptable.

At least they've fixed the two biggest design issues:

1. People don't want to hold their phone like a taco
2. People don't want to have to pull the battery from their phone in order to change games


So much so that you'd want NOTCH Korea to win over South Korea?
Then you don't want NOTCH Korea to win.
After wiping it, I'd also reinstall a few apps here and there... nothing that would have personal info or revealing  (no email, no facebook, etc), but make it look like it's at least been used a few times.

Ideally, you'll want to back up the phone and completely wipe it before crossing the border... but how many average users getting harassed over nothing know to do this?
Why would we want Notch Korea to win against South Korea?
It's a huge bummer (to me at least) to see what Kemco has become.  Admittedly, I only knew them for their NES games, but they had a ton that I used to enjoy.  The Android releases all look like cookie-cutter JRPG's.

I remember questioning this as a kid.  The PC my family got came with a bunch of software (Descent, Pitfall, and a few others) that were in paper sleeves with a red sticker on them that basically said that I agreed to the terms and licenses of the software if I broke the seal.

I couldn't understand how somebody could agree to licenses that they couldn't even see unless they put that CD in their computer.

I also questioned what would happen if I simply lifted the sticker and broke every rule in the agreement...

I'm surprised it wasn't a tie between Dominoes and Jacks.  They were the only two semi-logical choices.  I was thinking maybe a spinner was the dominoes that have the same number on both sides, or the wild-card dominoes.  I was also thinking "Spinner" could have been a slang term for the jacks themselves, as you can spin them.
Couldn't agree more.  If I'm going to fuck up a question, it's almost guaranteed to be some stupid US Geography or US History question.  I'm not American... those questions give Americans an unfair advantage.
Still no excuse to get that one wrong... it was clearly the most correct answer of them all.
Same... I was expecting "Spinner" to be a slang name for the jacks.  Ah well
Add an option to disable it, for the advanced users.
So what the real concern is, is that the patches aren't installed automatically by default.
I'm not judging anybody that's into that stuff... just keep your yiffs out of my gjifs plz.
> The average consumer doesn't give two shits about security patches

Does that mean that they should just totally forego security altogether?  Most users may not care about what they do, but I would assume that most actively install them when they come in.  Much like they would with Windows updates.

Just because your phone doesn't have anything important on it doesn't mean that everybody with the same phone also doesn't have important shit on it.

What's worse is that some companies are just fudging the numbers to pretend that they're up to date even though they aren't.
I think you're missing the problem altogether.  Just because you can't do it yourself doesn't mean that somebody else won't find a sneaky way to do it and fuck you up.

As long as we're not pronouncing them as "Yiffs" I think we're okay.
One suggestion - the hints seem way to easy to accidentally dismiss, and there's no way to recall hints you've already been given.
This is kinda fun!  I'm always in the mood for an abstract puzzle!
Right, how foolish of me.
gifs.
That actually makes perfect sense... The first words are "you're about to remove" and there are two checked boxes.

I instantly assumed check = remove


What you were implying is that double negatives would make more sense.
A girl says to her mom one day "mom, I'd it true that when you give birth, the baby comes out of the same place the man puts his penis?"

The mom says "yes, that is true"

The girl, looking at her mom, slightly worried and confused says "how doesn't that knock out all of your teeth?"
I was absolutely expecting a bamboozle like that other guy who was actually just being towed.
So you're saying you clicked no... Which makes you part of the 89%.

This headline is absolutely bullshit.  It should say "x% of people that said no actually granted permission"
Why?  I didn't give them permission and they don't have a log like the one people are shitting their pants over...
This headline is misleading... It seems to imply that everybody on Android granted permission or something.

I didn't give them permission, and I checked my metadata and confirmed there was no log.  The 4 or 5 screens you get on the messenger app were pretty clear (though designed to make you want to approve them).

So, of the 89% that said no but still managed to allow FB to scrape it?  They're either liars or illeterate.
TBF, b3ta is still around.
S5 then look into flashing it with CyanogenMod.
Inbox is terrible.  My Gmail is pretty tight with filters.
True, forgot about those days.
Greatest long-con of all time.  Except maybe the "what's a potato" guy on Reddit
Just like the top post on /r/tattoo about tea
I dunno, there was a blind guy who used to walk his dog down a stretch of sidewalk I took to go to school, and it was a minefield if shits.

He'd just feign stupidity "Duke, what are you doing? Come on Duke!"
I love how they keep talking about GMail for web, and throw in an Android photo.  0/10.
So does that mean we'll finally get YouTube Red in Canada, or that they'll remove GPM in Canada? lol
There's no reason why it can't transform into a different UX if you have peripherals to handle it... ie:

[Sentio Desktop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andromium.os)

[Samsung Dex](http://www.samsung.com/ca/apps/samsung-dex/)
Damn, fair enough.  I remember using it all the time - I thought it was easier to get to.
I thought it was user facing?
Which makes it even more embarrassing that iOS can't handle it.

That said, file browsing could be considered somewhat technical.  You'd be amazed by how few people can actually navigate through a file system.
What I'm saying is that iOS is much easier to use due to its limitations.  It's a far better option for people that aren't as technically oriented.  The problem is, they also tend to be the more expensive choice... so people that should use iOS may not be able to afford an iOS device.
Wasn't App Ops introduced in Android 4?  Then effectively stripped out in Android 5?
I think they ramped it up around 6, then dialed it back shortly after.  I think the biggest one was the "draw on top of other apps" that they ditched thanks to Facebook Messenger's "Faces" feature.
So it isn't Tow Borhrets?
Problem is, it used to be more restrictive and then idiots started bitching because they didn't like the constant prompts and such...  So they listened to the idiots and made the approvals more limited and "less annoying"
Don't forget to add the DEV flair to your post!

The problem with allowing game requests is that they will absolutely flood the subreddit.  So instead of being a place about Android Games, it will be a place about people asking for Android Game Suggestions.

I think it would be better to have a separate subreddit for that altogether.
Commandline is fairly niche, but customization is not.  Look at how many people swap icons or run a secondary launcher like Nova.

The fact of it all is, though, the hardware and price point of phones makes them about equivalent to a pocket-sized laptop.  There's really no reason why you shouldn't be able to do basic computer things on a cell phone these days - especially when you consider that phones can accept keyboard and mouse input via USB2Go.

With Android, you can almost treat your device like a laptop.

With iOS, you can't even come close.
I'm pretty sure you're being downvoted for the serious whoosh there.

Things always seem to be "Coming soon" to the point that people add a TM as a joke to the end because it's basically become a catch phrase.
They're supposed to be, unfortunately they're not always.  The other issue is that iPhones are sometimes out of the price range of the people that should be using them.
Nope.  Universal healthcare ftw
You can, but you can't do much as far as power user feature.  So talk/text/internet/games is about it.

No customization, no command line, no proper file manager.  It falls pretty flat when you try to do anything even remotely technical on it.
I'll check it out.  The screenshots have me 50/50 on whether this is my kinda game or not.
Yeah, that's true.  They're great for beginner/average users.  Beyond that, not so much.
Yeah, I can agree with you there.  They're great for beginner/average users.  People that just want a basic phone for talk/text/internet.  You run into problems when you want to treat it like an actual computer, which kind of sucks.  It has the hardware to be a pocket-sized computer, but the software won't allow it.
I'm just confused as to why we're all blaming Facebook for this... users agreed to it, and gave it permission didn't they?

If we want to bitch about Facebook being invasive, the conversation should be around the shadow profiles they have on non-users.
There's really not many more reasons to buy Apple gear over regular PC's and an Android phone.  The only thing I can possibly think of is if you're doing a lot of 3D rendering.

Most people that are in the Apple Ecosystem are suckers for the marketing.
Only if you allow it to be.  Some people will blindly approve everything without questioning it.
I wouldn't say that Android is more invasive, I'd say it is more flexible and open.  It allows you to develop apps that can have more integration with the rest of the system - this is part of what makes it really stand out when compared to iOS.

These applications aren't doing anything that the users haven't given them permission to do... the difference is that iOS holds your hand and locks everything down whereas Android allows tons of access, and puts the onus on the user to vet what they want an app to do.

It's all a lot of fearmongering and fingers being pointed in the wrong direction.
Normally I'd agree, but I can't find any option in-game to invite via contacts (or to send invites in general)

It's a scooby-dooby-dooby scooby-dooby melody!
Looks like it's asking for the following:

- Contacts
- Phone
- Storage

Phone is generally used to pause games.  Storage is likely for the HD graphics pack.  Only weird one (to me) is contacts.

[EDIT] I can't find any way in-game to send invites for multiplayer games, so that's why contacts isn't making sense to me

~~Is there any way to pull the DLC's you've bought on Steam into the Android game?~~

[EDIT] Figured it out - I hadn't logged into my Asmodee account on Steam yet.  It's all good now :D
Absolute steal!
Meatspin!
For those who don't know, I'm sorry you've lived such a sheltered life.  Lol
But wait... Who was filming that last scene? :O
That's got nothing on women when they say "I need to talk to you about ___" or "we need to talk"
But did he ever agree to an EULA saying he would disclose that?

While I'd love to shit on ol' Zukky, the only people that truly have a right to bitch about being violated, it's those very few people that don't have FB profiles.  They've got the right to bitch because they HAVE been profiled without agreeing to any EULA.
Thanks!
Right? I'm so glad I only have two arms... I have no idea what I'd do with THREE dick arms!
My phone is supposedly waterproof... So yeah, if it gets water damaged I'd definitely fight it.

What is "EST"?  Electro-Shock Therapy?
If they never asked you to do it first, how can it even be legal?!  They're charging you for something you never agreed to.
Sorry, that 1" piece isn't compatible with your device.  You can only use the 2.54cm piece.
Change?  RAWR 

*flips table*
I'm primarily a 2 player gamer...  I'd suggest the following:

- Snakes & Ladders
- Monop... 

Just joking - these games are either 2P only, or scale down to 2P really well:

- Patchwork
- Star Realms
- Potion Explosion
- Splendor
- Castles of Mad King Ludwig

Oh shit... You're right!
~~To be fair, this post was fine until the caption.  It's great to hear that more women are trying to get jobs in areas previously dominated by men.  To me, it means that women are being taken seriously (as they should).~~

Use iYTBP
The home tab is pretty handy - it will suggest videos based on things you watch... I've found a lot of great channels through there.

The real tab you want to avoid is the Trending tab.  That's mostly junk.
I tried NewPipe a while back and couldn't stand it.  I like how the YouTube homescreen curates videos from channels I'm subscribed to, and videos I'd probably like.  I often add a ton to my watch later, which is really all I ever watch on there (I just binge my WL list).  I can see how NewPipe has its strengths, but it didn't work for me.

iYTBP on the other hand has been absolutely fantastic and has had all the features that NP just added for what feels like a year or more now, but it's all patched right into the YouTube app (there's also a non-root version you can get that hooks into a YouTube APK so you can install it).
I tend to run rooted phones after they're out of warranty.
Didn't come with it. There's no way to delete system apps unless your phone is rooted.
This is what I had on mine as well.
Deleted or hidden?  The launcher doesn't matter - system apps can only be removed if your device is rooted.
I can't remove it from my S8+.  I'm pretty sure it's the carriers that bake it in as a system app.
You may not have an account, but you'd better belive they still have a full profile on you thanks to their API that is used on so many apps and websites.

Also, if you're using a Samsung phone, find the shit to get SABS installed on it and disable all of the Facebook system apps.  Sure they'll still take up a bit of space, but at least they're not also guzzling up your system resources.
We had a similar thing in the 90's only with braces.  Somehow braces almost became a fashion statement.

I don't get ice because the ice bins and dispensers are usually gross.

The soda jets usually are, too... So why double down on the disgusting?
Yeah, I do this sometimes but I find it gets sticky after so many extra churns.
What if you're making sandwiches, though...
Lol fucking autocorrect.

Yeah, there's nothing worse than butter pits.  I used to be bad for that when I was a kid.  I used to cut like cubes out of the margarine so I could have "butter like in the commercials"
How do you spread said chunks?

I personally prefer to keep some out ~~robot~~ so it remains soft and spreadable.

[Edit] fucking autocorrect
Exactly... How the fuck are you supposed to use cold butter?  All it does is clump and rip up the bread.
I hope they wash their hands in between transitions
What happened when you betrayed?  Did your dot do anything different?  Did it make it through the cell wall?

And when your circle gets betrayed, did you get a message letting you know?
This meme was already pretty big a while back.  I'm just surprised and confused about how it got resurrected.
True, but rickrolls never really died off. Nthis meme disappeared from existence for a while and has just come back huge.
Isn't there some way to report the ad?
FWIW I saw the gXcQ and knew exactly what was up.  But I commend you for your efforts.
Why the hell is this meme so popular now?  It's probably close to being 10 years old...
This certainly isn't going to cause any sort of uprising...

Sounds like the government is setting itself up to either get seriously fucked, or wipe out a good portion of its citizens.
Hasn't this been a thing since like Lollipop?
Wednesday Addams.

That whole "good time to sell" logic drives me nuts in general.

Like yeah, I own my house and I got it at a good price.  Yeah, it's gone way up in value - but guess what... So have all the other houses!  I'm literally no further ahead than I was before.  I'd have to own two properties in order to turn any sort of decent profit.
I was gonna ask if you meant for it to ferment or just forgot to toss it in the fridge (I've made that mistake a few times)

But then I saw your fancy kitchen and figured you looked like you knew what you were doing.

...so what exactly is it you're making?
