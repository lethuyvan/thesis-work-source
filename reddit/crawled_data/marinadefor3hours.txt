Would love to see how it ages after a few months of use. There's a noticeable lack of used grey Apple Leather cases being shared online. 
Honestly, everyone who heavily complains of the notch at this point is not an X owner. 

I own the X and the notch is there, but it disappears because I don't stare at the topmost part of my phone while I'm using it or while typing this comment. 
Avoid the third generation iPad at all costs. That thing runs like garbage. 

If you don't mind getting the latest iOS version with security updates, try the 4th generation iPad. 

Otherwise, look into a first generation iPad Air, or better yet, the 2018 (6th generation) iPad. 
Perhaps we can send a feedback via apple.com/feedback? I'm pretty sure there's a suggestion option for Apple Music there. 
This is a bug since the very first iOS 11.3 Beta. You can still tap the area you circled to slect a sound source even if the icon is not there. 
If you have entered her passcode to unlock the phone before, it definitely has learned your face. 

The thing is, whenever the passcode is input to unlock an iPhone X, the TrueDepth camera system captures what it sees. The sole purpose of this is to reduce FaceID failure rates. 

If you have indeed entered her passcode before, regardless if you're the original owner or not, FaceID may begin to recognize you as well. 
The 5 series was indeed beautiful. I remember reading some reviews calling it jewelry-like and they weren't wrong. 
I noticed this, too. 

I have a 6 Plus charging and an X nearby me and saying Hey Siri will trigger them on both devices, but the one farther away from me will indeed slowly stop listening. 
Not your fault. The problem wasn't well-described in the title until someone asked and OP responded. This is one of those things I was hoping the new "Descriptive Titles" rule would've addressed. 
I literally thought u guys are the same person smh
Since the 4s, Apple has notably stated they improved the glass on their phones regardless of whether it's on the front or back. 

With the iPhone 6, Apple said the glass is about twice as strong than the 5s. Then they made the glass stronger once again with the introduction of the 6s series with 3D Touch. 

The past few years, Apple kept acknowledging the stonger glass on later phones but they stopped using the predecessors for benchmark.

In the end, it's still glass and comparing it directly with a 4s wouldn't be fair since, well, we don't know exactly how much more durable they are on a scientific level, and that these glasses ultimately have different dimensions. 
I love it when they suddenly go from sending pre-defined quoted response to this, where they suddenly seem so much more human. Thank you for sharing this, OP!
I wouldn't say exactly 'resolved'. 

First, iOS still dynamically manages peak performance and the effects only become noticeable as the battery degrades further. Second, it's only limited to iPhones 6 and later. 

Now, users have the option to enable peak performance when they wish at the expense of a randomly shutting down device, however. 
Ok looking at your profile shows you're only a troll. Please go find a hobby. 
I wouldn't say it makes no real world difference, though. 

Most apps on landscape orientation lacks the niceties the Plus models has. Tabs in Safari is one thing I miss coming from a 6 Plus myself. There's also the fact that apps un-optimized for the X run like the 4.7" iPhones with huge artificial "bezels" on the top and bottom of the screen. 
To be fair the stainless steel on the 4s is a matte, non-reflective surface. The only part that could be easily dented there is the plastic liner surrounding the entire glass front and back. 
The side button is currently a way to do a lot of things that the home button once did. 

In fact, on the X, it has grown bigger solely to this reason alone. It would be unreasonable to remove it especially if you factor that it's also used for confirming payment authentications and that it's also used for Accessibility features. 
I know you're only joking, but if there is a perfect time to remove the Ring/Silent switch on iPhones, the iPhone X is the perfect device to do it. 

John Gruber stated this in his [iPhone X review](https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x), and I think he said it best:

> The hardware mute switch remains. If ever there were a time when Apple might get rid of it, iPhone X would have been it. That it remains on iPhone X suggests to me that Apple sees it as here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. If, like me, you love the mute switch, you might be thinking ‚ÄúWell of course they kept the mute switch, it would be terrible if they got rid of it.‚Äù But they removed it from the iPad a few years ago, and Apple is famously averse to physical buttons (cf. the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pros). And for reasons I‚Äôve never been able to understand, Android handset makers seem willing to copy everything and anything from Apple they can get away with (and even things they can‚Äôt get away with), but almost none have copied the iPhone‚Äôs mute switch, despite the fact that it‚Äôs extremely useful.


It's stainless steel but in Space Gray. The Space Gray has a PVC coating to match the space gray glass back. If OP polishes it like a watch, they would effectively destroy the PVC coating and end up with the original silver stainless steel. 
Just wondering has it ever been wet?

Also, I'm having a hard time seeing directly on the photos, but is the color simply fading or is it also peeling off? If it peels, it's mostly because the metal wasn't clean enough before the PVC coating is applied. You could argue this, but I doubt anyone would listen, let alone understand.

 It sucks how I'm now terrified my X that I got 2 months ago might end up like this. 
They are completely usable if all you do are basic tasks such as messaging, timers, quick alarms and such. 

I still have a 3Gs that gets used for basic tasks like above from time to time. It's not like completely unusable due to its age as you were implying. 
I'm actually glad they eventually reverted it back. It seemed useless in hindsight as it's the only app that had it this way. 
While the AirPods work with Android devices or basically any other device that has Bluetooth, unfortunately the double tap functionality is limited to play/pause unless you're using an iPhone running iOS 10 or later.
I mean you could use your argument and apply it for other smartphones. What's your point?
Basically, the notch exists as a way to maximize the screen real estate on a flat surface. Of course, there still needs to be a place to accommodate the entirety of the TrueDepth camera system, therefore we get a notch. Perhaps [this comment](http://reddit.com/r/Android/comments/80w8r7/phone_makers_are_rushing_to_ripoff_the_worst_part/duylpog) may help you appreciate the notch better. It's a compromise, but I like it. The chins and foreheads on other iPhones scream "wasted space" to me and they stick out now more than the notch. 

One of the biggest misconceptions when comparing the X with the Plus models is that the X's displays is bigger. Yes, it's taller, but it's not wider. The X also has a different aspect ratio and if you actually compute the surface area of the 2 devices, you ultimately end up with a bigger screen on the Plus models because you have to factor in the usable screen area is less on the X. The status bar is bigger, the bottom bars on Safari for example is larger to accommodate the home indicator, and there is the rounded corners, and of course, the notch which does remove some usable display area. 

One of the best things I like about the edge-to-edge display, though, is the rounded corners. It may seem gimmicky, but it felt organic and when I we went back to my old iPhone 6 Plus, the rectangular display seemed downright crude. 

Additionally, [John Gruber of Daring Fireball perhaps put a lot of my thoughts about the X on his iPhone X review.](https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x) It's worth taking a look. 
Animojis are fun, but the novelty wore off for me. 

You can save Animojis as videos and share them as a regular video files. 
Don't get me started about 3D Touching something in the Music app and then you'll get a context menu for literally something else that you didn't deep press. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
Has anyone filed a bug report? If someone did and it was closed, Apple may be already aware of it. I mean they should be aware of it now, right?

Also, I have a feeling this isn't something that they plan on fixing until iOS 12. Reminds me of the battery percentage issue iOS 8 had like how you never see 54%. The battery percentage just jumps from 55% to 53%. A simple bug like that was never fixed until the next iOS version, iOS 9. 
It's normal since the AirPods are not constructed from a single piece of plastic. All AirPods have seams, but if it's prominent enough to be causing pain, consider having it replaced under warranty. 
I just usually assume its my shitty internet connection, but yeah a force quit then relaunch works fine for now. Although, it sure is annoying to deal with every day. 
I live in a warm location and oftentimes when using AR or playing a graphic intensive game, Asphalt 8 for example, it will make my X hot. 

I use an app called CPU Dasher X to provide an estimate of the current clock speed and temperature of the CPU. Once the app reports "Serious" as the temperature, I start noticing frame drops and the CPU frequency gets as low as ~1100Mhz. 
There's already a default 'Recently Added' Smart Playlist. 
You get this on iTunes on the desktop, I wish it will make its way on mobile eventually. 
To be fair, on iOS, you're not supposed to micro-manage your apps by closing all of them if your main goal is to save battery. 

But by all means, use your phone and have an opinion accordingly. 
In iOS 10, it was actually better since Notification Center had Spotlight Search on both the Widget and Notification screens.

Now with iOS 11, it's a regression since it's Spotlight is now limited to the Widget page, 
The only other method to access Spotlight is to swipe down from the top to view the Lock Screen, then swipe right to access the widget screen. 
I've seen people talk about this since iOS 11.0 betas. 
I wonder if this also happens on non-iPhone X devices. 
I would love this, but it's also a pain in the ass considering how the 12" MacBook only has a single port. 
> 3D touch is broken only in Apple Music. If I 3D touch, it'll invoke it somewhere else on the screen. On a different song/album etc. This happens about 50% of the times I 3D touch in the music app, and it works perfectly in all other apps

Someone shared a similar list here of their Apple Music experiences, and this one was there, too. I experience this, too, and I think the problem is widespread. It may be worth opening a bug report via bugreport.apple.com

> About 50% of the time, the lock screen widget doesn't show how far I am in a song, but is stuck at 0:00

This is an iOS 11 bug and it happens on both my X and 6 Plus. A restart fixes this, though. 
The omission of the headphone jack could mean extra space for the Taptic Engine.

The iPhones 8, 8 Plus, and X have different dimensions for its Taptic Engine, but they're all worth noting to be larger than the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus. 
It's called 3D Touch. 

I haven't used the Control Centre functionality of the Timer that much to confirm if it resets to 1 minute by default after a while. 

Anyway, after you 3D Touch the timer icon, you can simply continue swiping up (without letting go of that deep press) until you get to 1 hour. 
The thing about software in general is that it takes time to smooth it out and get all the major bug/performance fixes in. 

With Apple, they seem to be aggressively pushing new features/rewriting a lot of stuff at a marketing dictated deadline to impress their investors, therefore, the OS is rushed and us customers face the consequences of experiencing such bugs. 

Hopefully, the indeed slow it down and perhaps focus on delivering the stability iOS was used to be renown for. 
I meant to reply to you. I was backing up your claim at how the 11.3 update or .3 updates in general brought improvements in performance. 
On the iPhones, it may be definitely a coincidence, but it's also a steady pattern for the past 10 years since the very first iPhone was introduced. 

On the iPads however, things have been inconsistent like you pointed out, and it's worth noting that iPads don't seem to have a consistent launch schedule. Therefore, some iPads launched early in the year (iPads 2,3 Pro 9.7" for example) and some later in the year while using a soon-to-be outdated processor type; the second generation iPad Pros for example just launched a few months before Apple debuted the next generation A11 chips. 

I feel bad for the very first generation iPad owners only getting 3 major iOS versions because of it's limited RAM. The iPad 2, however, managed up to 6 updates because it was indeed launched earlier in 2011, when iOS 4 was still the main version number in the timeframe that iPad launched, and it stopped receiving updates past iOS 9. 

The iPad 3 however, runs the same CPU as the iPad 2, so that probably explains why it stopped receiving updates at the same time as its predecessor. 

The iPad mini launched in late 2012, but ran the same internals as an iPad 2 mostly with the exception of a smaller nanometer process, and it also has a similar identifier as an iPad 2, so that could be why it also stopped receiving updates past iOS 9. 

iPod touches, despite being updated yearly in their infancy, had similar CPUs to the iPhone they coincided with, but with less RAM, if I recall correctly, so that may probably be why they stopped receiving iOS updates earlier than their iPhone counterparts. 
Recent history proves that the x.3 releases mostly irons out bugs that people have been raging about. 

I wouldn't blame anyone if they ultimately prefer to remain on an older version or updating immediately as the newest firmware isn't always perfect, let alone without any issue that QA didn't catch. 

iOS 8.0.1 for example was a particularly embarrassing situation for Apple as it caused issues with Touch ID and cellular connectivity, and people who immediately upgraded to it didn't receive a fix until a day later. 
I'm surprised that even after years of iOS releases, people still haven't figured the pattern Apple does for their iOS support matrix. 

Let's take a look at previous iOS support patterns:

 iPhone Model  | Number of major updates supported
-------------|---------------------------------
iPhone | 3 major versions (iOS 1 - 3)
iPhone 3G | 3 major versions (iOS 2 - 4)
iPhone 3GS | 4 major versions (iOS 3 - 6)
iPhone 4 | 4 major versions (iOS 4 - 7)
iPhone 4S | 5 major versions (iOS 5 - 9)
iPhone 5 | 5 major versions (iOS 6 - 10)

The very first two iPhones started with supporting 3 major iOS versions. Then came the 3Gs and notice something happening with every 's' model in general? The 's' models consistently have had an increase in the number of major iOS releases that it supported. 

Additionally, it's worth noting that 's' phones have had a lot of things in common. First, they're all introduced in odd-numbered years from 2009-2015, they all have the same design as their predecessors, and that all of their processors are odd numbers as well with the exception of the iPhone 3Gs. 

But also, Apple broke some of these patterns namely, the iPhone 7 not introducing a major facelift and major structural change to the phone compared to its predecessor, and the iPhone 8 which is basically a 7s, but still is released in an odd year and has an odd-numbered processor for the sake of its identifier. Then there's also the iPhone X which Apple says is planned for 2018, but runs the exact same internals as the iPhone 8. 

Ultimately, I wouldn't be surprised, given the table and reasoning above if Apple's current iPhone lineup continues the one in the table above like this one:

iPhone Model  | Number of major updates supported
-------------|---------------------------------
iPhone 5s | 6 major versions (iOS 7 - 12)
iPhone 6 | 6 major versions (iOS 8 - 13)
iPhone 6s | 7 major versions (iOS 9 - 15)
iPhone 7 | 7 major versions (iOS 10 - 16)
iPhone 8 and X | 8 major versions (iOS 11-18)
TL;DR: Bluetooth works very differently from Wi-Fi. It needs a surface to bounce off, and while you are crossing the street, there are no large flat surfaces for the signal to bounce off. 

It's nice to actually know this. I've always wondered why it sometimes happen randomly in addition to certain specific areas where I usually walk during my time outdoors. 
Not trying to be boastful or braggy of any sorts, but the whole point of biometric authentication is to provide a secure *and* quick method to protect your own private data that you should be protecting in the first place. 


When Apple introduced TouchID in the iPhone 5s, they succeeded at that. You simply have to put your fingerprint on the home button. 

Now with FaceID, it's even more natural considering how you simply have to swipe like you would even if you don't have FaceID authentication enabled. 

The point is, I really don't understand why people are still hesitant to protect their own private datas now that we have 2 major iterations of biometric authentication which makes this task deadass simple. 
TL;DR: Starting with iOS 11.3, iOS saves the last time a device has been unlocked (either with biometrics or passcode) or was connected to an accessory or computer. If a full seven days (168 hours) elapse since the last time iOS saved one of these events, the Lightning port is entirely disabled.

Also the more I think about this, the more I feel that an iPhone without a Lightning port is indeed possible considering how Apple has previously envisioned the iPhone as a completely wireless device. 
Hot. 
I'm really curious as to how you got this info. 
The thing about Animoji's though is that the flood illuminator actually doesn't work there. If you try to use the feature in the dark, you will get a "Low Light" notice at the bottom of the screen, which is something that doesn't happen with FaceID. 

The point is, FaceID is definitely consuming a significant amount of power considering how it uses the entire TrueDepth camera system + the internal system processing the phone does to ensure a match stored within the Secure Enclave. 
My very first reply to you is my workaround. 
Unfortunately, going straight to Private Browsing is currently a limitation within SVC. 
First off, you need to get your iPhone 6 back to a stable release version. 

Download the full iOS 11.3 ipsw file and "update" via iTunes. After that, make a new backup (use iTunes since it's faster) for your newly downgraded phone. 

From here on, you can connect your new iPhone X to iTunes and restore from the iPhone 6 backup you just did. 
With Safari View Controller, you can still do private browsing. 

Just open a new Private Tab in Safari first then go back to the narwhal app. 
I'm actually stuck here wondering what could be possibly causing the X to have less battery life than the 8 Plus and in some tests, the 8. 

The X has the highest capacity of all 3 by incorporating a two-cell battery. It also has OLED technology‚Äîwhere it doesn't use a backlight because the pixels are individually lit. Is it possible that Face ID is also a battery hog?
I time my AirPods charge time and they take about 20-25 minutes from 0% to 100%. 

A 15 minute charge should restore to about 3 hours of listening time as per Apple's product description, or essentially, 15 minutes of charge only get the pods to 75% from 0%. 
What's odd is that while these iPhone X clones do incorporate a notch to have an edge-to-edge display, most of them still have a chin or a bezel at the bottom.

I wonder why.
Someone shared a tip here a while back saying to re-do the "Hey Siri" setup to recognize you better except this time, place it from afar you. Maybe that could help you?

I tried this and I noticed improvements on my iPhones 6 and X albeit rather minimal improvements. 
The HomePod has a 6 microphone array for far-field Siri. Every iPhone since the 6s has about 4. Perhaps Apple can bring the HomePod's microphone technology in the iPhones once they worked out on the miniaturization and efficiency of those. 
Rumor has it iBooks improvements were reverted back to pre-iOS 11.3 Beta 1 in iOS 11.3 Beta 4 and will now make its way in iOS 12. 
I'd wager there's definitely something wrong with the left pod. It just worsened overtime due to my heavy usage. 

I wish there's a diagnostic tool to check the AirPods battery health ourselves, but there appears to be none. 
Yes, I mentioned that in the thread I made linked above. 
[I made this thread about 9 months ago](http://reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6op6nc/left_airpod_battery_draining_faster/), but overtime, the parity between my two pods grew wider with my left pod dying already while the right one still has about 50%. 

Fortunately, I was still within the warranty period and I was eligible for a free replacement. With my new pair, they still don't die at the same time, but the difference is back to a minimum such as anywhere from 3% to 10%. 
Just wondering why do you sign your Reddit posts?
what do their souls taste like
You can add trees of folders, but I think you need to do it in the Mac app or the iCloud.com webapp from a desktop browser. 
Did you even read the article? If you did, did it ever occur to you that maybe a significant fraction of the iPhone X's price is indeed due to the hefty price tag Samsung sells their OLED displays for? 
Did you restore from an iCloud backup? It might still be downloading contents in the background. If you have iCloud Photo Library enabled, that might be a culprit, too. 

For now, you can try moving to a well ventilated or air onditioned area. You can always return your phone within the 14-day period if you feel like it. 
But doesn't Apple and AASP have a calibration machine to detect such issues when repairing an iPhone display for example?
If you were on iOS 10.2.1 or later, I'd wager a significant amount of the performance was impacted by a worn battery. It might be more accurate to test these anecdotally with a new battery on your 6 or just have it on iOS 11.3 with Peak Performance Capability enabled. Nonetheless, going from a 6 to an 8 is a huge upgrade!
Highkey would **love** a red reflective stainless steel band. 
I always see this said in here a lot, but do you happen to know an article or a support article that acknowledges this? I'd love to read more aboit it. 
The whole rice thing is really a myth. Wet devices (or really any other thing that needs immediate dryness) are better off left in a container with a few silica gel. 

Also at this point, Apple will likely not entertain repair requests for the AirPods considering they were tampered and might be hazardous at this point. 

If the AirPods did stop working due to water damage, you could've gotten a new pair since they don't have water damage indicators. 
Without Apple explicitly mentioning FaceID improvements in software updates, it's hard to credit them with software updates rather than the machine learning mechanism your phone does locally. 
If your phone only has a single hairline crack, it may be worth taking it to Apple. 

Leaked warranty support guidelines from previous iPhones used to attribute a single hairline crack to a defective glass component as seen [here for example.](https://i.imgur.com/NnWwUQG.jpg)
It's due to the oleophobic coating. 

iPhone displays have had them since the 3GS and Apple added it to the glass backs of the 4 and 4s. Its sole purpose is to easily remove marks and fingerprint oils from the reflective glass design of these phones. 
I mean you can verify this yourself instead of being passive aggressive. 
MacBook Pro generations historically have received major redesigns every 4 years. 
How many times do you cut or damage your face?
Through the years, I've downloaded a couple apps that immediately crash upon launch. 
Wondering where OP got that as well. 
If Apple will redesign the iPad Pro to the likeness of iPhone X, it will most like likely have a curved screen and Face ID. 

For now, Face ID doesn't work in landscape orientation on the iPhone X or even have multi-user support, but I can imagine this being available on future Face ID iterations. 

I'm also wondering if the TrueDepth camera system will have a cutout at the top to maximize space, but I think it won't make sense on a tablet. On the iPhone, it would sense since the phone fits in the palm of your hand. On an iPad, an almost edge-to-edge display wouldn't quite make sense because it requires a two hands for usability.
If the iStore is an Authorized Apple Service Provider, they should abide by Apple's method of handling AirPod replacements. 

Apple offers a US$69 replacement fee for lost AirPods. 

If you'll ultimately prefer to replace your AirPods in the US with the help of your friend, you'll have to give the remaining pod along with the case. This is because Apple needs to verify a serial number to confirm you're not just purchasing a standalone single AirPod. 
Oh god. I used to have a 6 Plus a few weeks ago and the Messages app quick reply was too damn slow. And this was during the iOS 11.3 betas with Peak Performance enabled.

Sucks. I remember people being able to exchange theirs if their purchase was within 30 days. 
A lot of posts like this have been made here and in r/apple and r/iphone as well. Make sure to report them using the Feedback app!
iCloud for Messages was a feature announced back in WWDC 2017 last June. It's slated for a future iOS release. It briefly made an appearance in the iOS 11.0 betas, but was later removed. It made an appearance again in the iOS 11.3 betas, but Apple acknowledged in the release notes that the feature was added for testing and debugging purposes, which should not surprise anyone who read the release notes as to why it was removed in the final 11.3 version. 

The feature seems to be back in iOS 11.4 Beta 1, but so far there's no acknowledgement if it will actually stay in the final 11.4 release or will be ultimately delayed until a future iOS version (presumably iOS 12 or later.)

The iMessages getting out of sync is a different issue that seems to be plaguing a lot of users. Apple says that it's fixed by iOS 11.2.5, but it still persisted for a lot of people. I'm now on the final iOS 11.3 release and it seems to have been fixed for me. 

Also tagging u/dannydomenic
To be fair for iOS 11.3, when Apple added Messages for iCloud, it was stated in the patch notes that the feature is for testing and debugging purposes only. So I wasn't surprised when it was pulled from the final 11.3 release. 
But the silicon cases peel, right?
I'd wager the TrueDepth camera system also plays a huge factor when it comes to battery life. 

I'm not simply talking about Face ID. The new camera system has a feature that allows to constantly check for a user's eyes to detect if they're looking at the screen. If the user is not looking at the screen, the system will quickly dim the display and subsequently put to phone to sleep. 

I wonder how much battery life tests will differ if this feature is disabled by these publications. 

edit: [The feature I'm talking about is called 'Attention Aware Features' found in Face ID and Passcode Settings.](https://i.imgur.com/BbqubUg.jpg)
Open Character Map on Windows then search for the Beta symbol from there. 
Keyboard haptic feedback is something that gets upvoted here from time to time whenever someone brings it up. 

I have a few questions though. What iOS device do you happen to have along with its iOS version? Also, is there a noticeable impact on battery life?
The Taptic Engines on the iPhones 7 and later is a second generation haptic engine which is significantly larger than the ones in the 6s. 

It allows for more frequencies of vibration and has a Haptic API that is limited to the iPhones 7 and later. 
As far as I know, the Sounds & Haptic option is only available on the 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus, and X because only these devices have options to configure system haptic feedback. 

On the 6s, the Setting is only titled "Sounds" because such configuration for system haptics doesn't exist. 

This limitation is due to the 6s containing the first generation Taptic Engine which is quite smaller and the Haptic API is limited to the newer devices. 
this is r/me_irl bc nobody sends me those firework effects
Beta 6 is identical to the final release with the exception of a slightly different build number and iCloud for Messages feature being lost on the final release. 
I don't think I'll ever use that feature after [reading this embarrassing scenario from someone who tried that about 2 years ago. ](http://reddit.com/r/apple/comments/55as44/where_to_report_apple_store_experience/)
Jony Ive is shook

Looks really pretty. Thank you, bb
It seems to resemble a default macOS wallpaper. 
I came from an iPhone 6 Plus with only 1GB of RAM and got pretty much used to its almost non-existent multitasking capabilities. 

When I upgraded to the X just last month, I honestly expected it to be so much better, but the RAM management, despite the X having 3GB of RAM, seems to still be having issues. 
Relying on Apple Maps is unfortunately synonymous with getting lost where I live. 
Wait what. Apple Watch doesn't have a Google Maps app *anymore*? Was the reason for removal ever explained? 

That's such an odd decision as someone considering picking up an Apple Watch. 
I still think it's worth a shot. Like I previously stated, a swollen battery is considered a safety hazard, that's why Apple often considers to replace batteries free of charge. I'm pretty sure Apple considers safety as one of their customers' priorities. 

Now considering your Mac is old, I think you can still attempt to communicate with a technician to at least remove the battery for you and from there on, you can maybe order a third party battery (preferably from iFixit) if Apple doesn't provide a replacement for your 2010 Mac anymore. 

Also be sure to be nice and be safe!
I never thought about asking someone from a fire station as a possibility for situations like these. 

Also, OP, if you could have Apple do it, it may be worth going through them as swollen batteries are considered safety hazards and they may replace your machine's battery for free. 

Be careful. 
Wallpaper?
While a lot of people undeniably look at Apple's past operating systems with rose-colored glasses, I'd have to disagree with the generalization that iOS 6 ran bad on older hardware. 

I remember having an iPhone 3GS back in 2012 and iOS 6 - 6.1.3 ran fine on it and the 3GS is the oldest hardware that iOS 6 supports. The 3GS was introduced back in 2009 and it didn't even have Apple's new A-Series processor. 
Yes. It's available worldwide. 

Additionally, I'm not certain, but Apple Stores or Apple Authorized Service Providers should match the price of US$29. 
> So, my freshly updated iPhone 6 is now running with Peak Performance until there's an unexpected shutdown due to battery. 

Correct. 

> But it could've been running in throttled mode before.

Yup. If you have a worn battery and your phone is on a firmware anywhere between iOS 10.2.1 to iOS 11.2.6, the dynamic performance feature is enabled by default with no way to disable it until now. 

Also don't forget that Apple has a special discounted battery replacements for $29 if you haven't taken advantage of it yet. This offer is available until December 2018. 
The iPhone 5s and iPads never supported this dynamic power management introduced in iOS 10.2.1 last year, so they've always been running at peak performance even if those devices suffered a sudden shutdown. 
To be fair, all Lithium-ion batteries experience degradation at some point. That's why engineers are always at work at developing the next breakthrough when it comes to portable batteries. 

Also, you'd be surprised to find out at how iPhone batteries can manage to supply the same amount of screen on time or even go beyond their competitors with much smaller battery capacities. 

Battery technology is something that's being worked on all the time and it's one of the biggest hindrances in technology advancements. But if anything, it encouraged manufacturers to produce energy efficient chips, software, and other hardware components. 
If you just recently updated to iOS 11.3, your iPhone is automatically running with peak performance. 

You're worrying too much about this. 
System animations improving has been a common theme in succeeding iOS X.X releases even before iOS 11. 

If anything, it just makes me wonder what causes such regression in system animations in the first place. 
As a someone who was in the 11.3 beta bandwagon, let me explain a few things:

- Any device newly updated to iOS 11.3 will run with Peak Performance.  

- Once your iPhone experiences a sudden shutdown, the dynamic system performance management will kick in, and only then will the setting to disable it will appear in the 'Battery Health (Beta)' settings. 
The 'disable power management' option won't be available upon installation of iOS 11.3 final because peak performance capability is enabled automatically. 

The power management will only kick in once the iPhone in question has suddenly experienced a sudden shutdown, only then you will have that option to 'disable power management'. 

That's how it was during the lengthy iOS 11.3 Beta period. 
A lot of factors can contribute to a faster degradation of battery. Temperature being one. 

Also, I wouldn't worry much about a fast degrading battery since the iPhone X is still under warranty if ever it decided to degrade past 80% before 12 months of ownership. The iPhone X is also included in the list of devices that Apple offers the $29 discounted battery price at that you can take advantage of anytime until December 2018. 
Someone who already received their 2018 iPad confirmed that iCloud messages is not in the final 11.3 build anymore. 
> iPad charge management

>>Maintains battery health when iPad is connected to power for prolonged periods of time, such as when it is used in kiosks, point of sale systems, or stored in charging carts

This is really interesting. I haven't seen anyone talk about this. 
I should have rephrased my comment above. 

Basically, the AirPods have a tiny driver and lack noise isolation, it wouldn't be fair to compare them against full sized headphones due to how differing their driver sizes are, but you are correct in the regard that it *is* possible to achieve audiophile grade sound quality even without noise isolation. 

The problem still with the AirPods though, is that they lack noise isolation and have tiny drivers. Apple can only do so much to improve their sound with these limitations. 

Honestly, for the price they're at, I'm more than content for what they offer especially since there was quite a noticeable improvement compared to the wired EarPods variant. 
I think the Essential's notch really looks cute.
I feel like people are expecting too much for them to sound glorious for their design. They're not In-Ear Monitors and won't have a flagship sound signature because they lack basic noise isolation. 

I'd wager a lot of people complaining about their sound don't even take this into factor. 
The 12.9" iPad Pros definitely should have come with at least the 29W charger. 
Yeah the 120Hz refresh rate is really nice. It's one thing to write about it and another to experience it. 

I hope one day they come to the iPhones without noticeable degradation of GPU and battery performance. 
Years after its introduction, I still find it funny when people call that Mac Pro as a "trashcan" lmao 
I wonder about Apple's profit margins, too. Although, it's the same, recycled design, so research & development might not have been a huge factor in this device's overall cost anymore. 

I can't wait for an iPad with Face ID, but Apple has to make sure it works in landscape orientation first. 
The device is $329 and it was revealed during an education-centric event with the primary market being students and schools. 

If you're looking for a better iPad, there is the iPad Pro, but then, even those current flagship iPads would be underwhelming for you since they don't have "super thin" bezels. 
I don't know if it's just people being oblivious or the sense of entitlement is reaching new heights at this point. 

I personally think that the new 2018 iPad is a bargain for what it offers. Of course, Apple still have to cut costs but it shoule be good enough for what it's priced at. 
> Maybe they don't want people to know?

Nah, that's an odd way to look at it. It's not like the SE is difficult to produce or is scarce. 

> while most in the US get the newest iPhones.

I agree with this, however. 

A lot of people here previously mentioned that they know a few people on a 5s or older who wouldn't update to the newer phones solely because they want to retain the ease of one-handed use afforded by the 4" screen. To those people's surprise, the iPhone SE already exists‚Äîso there's definitely a market for it. 

I guess Apple's just not interested in heavily promoting the SE due to the lower profit margins. 
The SE is so neglected I wish Apple gave it enough promotion since a lot of people didn't seem to be aware that such device exists. 
Ugh. I used to anticipate his videos back when he still wasn't showing his face. 

I'm a huge fan of his narration, but now I don't even bother since he's now no different from anyone else doing shitty click-bait videos. But in the end, it gives him money so he still wins, I guess. 
> Naked Notification Center

Scandalous 
There have been recent rumors that a cheap MacBook is coming this year. Conflicting reports reveal that it's either a new MacBook or an updated MacBook Air. 

It's safe to say that an update is indeed coming this year, either way, the actual timeframe is just unclear. WWDC in June, September, and October are dates to watch, though. 
The widget is also available in other parts of the world. 

I'm just really wondering in general why only 3 countries have access to the News app. 
That's odd. As far as I know iTunes related billing should prioritize the gift card balance associated with your account first. At least that's what my account does. 

Have you tried removing your associated credit card to try it out?
What iPad did you have prior? 

This new iPad (and last year's) isn't necessarily bad, but not 2017 flagship standard. 
I envy you. I for one have been too obsessed/spoiled by minor differences such as these that tapping on a non-laminated display just feels like tapping on a piece of plastic, rather than glass. 

Also, a non-laminated display destroys the illusion that the content on the screen appears to be floating for me, at least. 
If anything, the lack of an anti-reflective coating makes this device similar to the iPad Air 1/mini 1 which were horrible to use in daylight. 
It's similar to the iPhone 8's gold color because [if you look at the Rose Gold on the 10.5" iPad, it looks like a hybrid of Gold and Rose Gold.](https://i.imgur.com/vbFfNEQ.png)
Looks like they replied to the wrong thread. 
Seems like Space Grey is not the only ever-changing color anymore!
An important piece from this article:

> Keep in mind this won‚Äôt work like the Apple Music student discount, where any student with a .edu is eligible. The updated 200GB plans are only for students with school provided Apple IDs.


‚Ä¶it's already over
This is correct. 

It says in the [summary section here](https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/#ipad-pro-10-5,ipad) that the new 9.7 iPad as well as the mini 4 is only compatible with Bluetooth keyboards. 
This happened to me on multiple occasions. 

Like you said there's simply something that prevents the contacts of the AirPods from touching the ones in the case. A simple blow inside the case alleviates this. 
The fact that my $1,500 smartphone is suffering from frame drops is frustrating, let alone embarrassing. 
I don't know what I expected. 
Do note that if you choose to replace your phone's battery with third party battery, Apple or any of their Authorized Service Providers (AASP) won't entertain anymore requests you have for your device. 

I see no problem regarding battery replacements in another country since you still get the same device, and not a whole unit replacement. 
> Changing images doesn't prevent anything, only delays the wear of particular subpixels that a UI element uses the most. Everything adds up. 

Interesting. Thanks for this. 

Maybe I'll worry about OLED burn in after a few years since I plan to keep my X long, and I trust Apple when they say they've done sufficient workarounds to prevent such from happening. 
I literally don't worry about burn in at all. 

Wasn't there an article that revealed it took 17 hours of displaying the same static image on a test iPhone X before it displayed noticeable burn in artifacts?

I never even keep my phone on for a consecutive 17 hours let alone display the same static image that long. 
System storage can vary a lot because it's not solely "system" storage. Most of it are cached files by the system and Apple Music's streaming cache if you have an Apple Music subscription ‚Äî which builds up a lot. 
For me it's 80% and above. 

I'm aware that the iPhone fast charges from 0% to 80% and then slows down the charging process in 80% and beyond to preserve the battery's lifespan. Mine just seems to be overtly aggressive. 

I use coconut battery to monitor how much power is being sent to my iPhone and it literally doesn't charge anymore once it hits 80%. 

Yup. I often find the swipe down on the home indicator Reachability gesture a little inconsistent even after a month of owning the X. 
Adding Reachability and Control Center in the AssistiveTouch menu improved my iPhone X's usability. 
If I have to guess, probably for legibility and to avoid potentially mistaking the letters 'L' and 'O' as numbers '1' and '0'. 
Mini 3.* 

The Mini 2 was essentially identical to the Air 1 apart from the display's color gamut. 
This is gonna sound weird, but a few tips posted here before, if you would read back on similar threads, is that you could try sucking on them. 

One thread mentioned an AppleCare adviser even recommended this method for them. 
How long have you had them?

I had mine since January 2017, and I noticed starting in December 2017, when I just literally put them in the case, the AirPod's battery would quickly jump to 80%. I know that's not normal because after immediately pulling them out to use them, they would immediately die. 

I recently got them replaced and it takes them about 15 minutes to reach 75% or 25 minutes to reach a full 100% which is what I remember how my first pair did over a year ago. 
It actually may be worth sending a bug report now rather than waiting for the final build. After all, the whole purpose of being enrolled in a beta program is to report bugs as we experience them. 
Regarding the mute switch, if you've read the [Daring Fireball review of the iPhone X](https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x), I think John Gruber said it best:

> The hardware mute switch remains. If ever there were a time when Apple might get rid of it, iPhone X would have been it. That it remains on iPhone X suggests to me that Apple sees it as here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. If, like me, you love the mute switch, you might be thinking ‚ÄúWell of course they kept the mute switch, it would be terrible if they got rid of it.‚Äù But they removed it from the iPad a few years ago, and Apple is famously averse to physical buttons (cf. the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pros).


The iBooks changes were reverted back in Beta 4. It's rumored to be delayed until iOS 12. 
[When CNET contacted Apple for a comment regarding their drop test, this is what Apple had to say:](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-iphone-x-drop-test/)

> "The new iPhone is designed to be durable, but not indestructible, and goes through rigorous real world testing. iPhone X is made from the most durable glass ever in a smartphone with a 50 percent deeper strengthening layer using our dual ion-exchange process, further reinforced by an internal laser welded, steel and copper structure. And the surgical-grade stainless steel band that wraps around and reinforces iPhone X is a special Apple-designed alloy that is both durable and more pure. If anyone is concerned about dropping their iPhone and damaging it, we suggest using one of the many beautiful cases available to protect iPhone."

So basically, the iPhones are built to be durable using premium materials with further strengthened internals not visible to the customer's naked eye. However, we still have to factor in the materials used. Glass, however durable it is can still shatter. 
You can, however, put two fingers on the iPad keyboard to transform it as a cursor, similar to the iPhone's 3D Touch exclusive gesture. 
That's why I asked you if you were being serious about not knowing Siri left beta or simply poking fun at its capabilities. 

For the record, I'm not defending Siri. In fact, I found its ability to follow me as I move through differrent topics has regressed over the years. 
Not sure if you're poking fun of Siri or actually serious, but [Siri lost the beta tag in all of Apple's website back in 2013 with the launch of iOS 7. ](https://9to5mac.com/2013/09/14/nearly-two-years-after-launch-siri-seems-to-exit-beta-with-ios-7/)
I'm so sorry for your loss. 

But if you don't have an immediate family to tell you that your behavior is very insensitive and inexcusable, we will tell you that. 

You may not realize it now, but hopefully someday in the future, you take this backlash you received as a learning point. 

It's not that hard to be kind. 
I'm more concerned about purchasing a $1000 phone and then slapping a crappy case on it regardless of the case's price. But hey if you like it, you do you. 
Did you recently have a call?

Someone's posted a similar thing here yesterday I think and they mentioned the bug persisted after a phone call?
Hopefully when you get a little older, and lose loved ones in your life, since as you say it's bound to happen eventually, you become more cautious with your words and actions. 

In the mean time, don't cut yourself with that edge, bro. 
The camera cutout ain't even aligned üòÇ
Imagine being this self-absorbed. 
The iPhone 6 Plus, which I owned for 3 years before upgrading to the X, was similarly the iPad 3 of the iPhone lineup. 

With only 1GB of RAM and marginal improvements to the CPU and GPU, coupled with iOS 8, the buggiest iOS release ever at that time, it provided a horrible experience. It didn't feel very Apple at all. 

Additionally, I found the 5s or even my sister's older 5 performed better even probably due to the lack of optimization for the Plus model. 

It should have shipped with 2GB of RAM in the first place, but it didn't so it was kind of almost useless for multitasking and memory can barely hold more than 3 tabs in Safari. 
> and the battery life was absolutely miserable (now we know why)

Care to elaborate?
We're at a transitional period and it kind of sucks. 

However if you can't jump into using wireless headphones in the mean time, have you considered buying a splitter? Particularly the ones from Belkin?
Even though it'll probably be closed as a duplicate, a new submission might improve visibility of the bug by the team who's responsible for compiling them. 

Yup. Something I experience since the very first 11.3 Beta. It's quite annoying. 

I sent a bug report about this, make sure you do, too!
[i remember reading this last year and it was quite a horrifying experience even if i was only reading about it](https://reddit.com/r/apple/comments/55as44/where_to_report_apple_store_experience/)
Oh god. I remember this. I wonder how that person is and the whole case is now. I didn't get yo read much about the follow up thread they did, but I hope they were compensated for that horrifying experience. Y
I mean almost everytime I see that person, they're almost always saying something controversial. It's just so tiring. I wish there's a way to mute someone on narwhal. 
afaik no Android manufacturer does this, but someone on r/Android previously explained it's because they can't. 
Not sure if I pity or envy people oblivious enough to defend that this isn't a bug when they don't realize the sloppy design themselves. 
Technically the 5s is still only 4 years old as it was unveiled in Fall 2013. 
The $29 battery replacement discount is not applicable to the 5s because iOS does not support its dynamic system performance scaling on that device. 
I just realized that 11.3 final will definitely not be a delta update so that will take longer. 

But ever since 11.3 beta 4, even though it's about 200+ mb for the iPhone X, it still is amazing to just watch the progress bar fly through when the device is updating. 
> it's devices on the same account synchronizing the keychain over automatic adhoc WiFi/Bluetooth networks, so your Mac doesn't need to join a network first just to get the new network your iPhone just joined.

Wow I didn't know this. 
I timed the update again and it took about 4 minutes and 29 seconds on my X. A little faster than the previous beta's 5 minutes. 

I wonder, come the final version, if it'll still be as fast as this when updating. 
Yup. The front facing camera is actually not responsible for anything when setting up Face ID other than detecting your face and so you can see yourself in the setup screen. 

Other than that, the dot projector and IR blaster work in tandem in less than ideal lighting conditions so I don't see why setting up Face ID in a dark room should be a problem. 
I think the Pixel does it by Machine Learning, no?
[this usually works ](http://www.chipmunk.nl/cgi-fast/applemodel.cgi)
I find all iPhone 8's I held had a very prominent plastic liner between the glass and the aluminum body. Quite surprising at how prominent it feels considering Apple's usual attention to detail, you would have thought they would make it feel seamless throughout. 
What iOS version are you on?

I just got the X about a month ago, and restored from an 11.3 Beta backup and I never experienced this disappearing lock screen bug. 
Are you talking about the iPhone X exclusive gestures for the home indicator or how the iPhone X tracks touch sample rate at 120Hz?

Because I really don't notice the 120Hz touch sample rate myself, yet people keep praising how smooth they are. I feel like I'm missing something fun ‚òπÔ∏è
Was the G3 a flagship device?
shh bb is ok
First of all those are stutters, not lag. 

This happens on my X, too. However, it seems to be happening only after a restart and only really persists for a few seconds. Perhaps a warm device could be the culprit of this issue?
I've had the AirPods for over 14 months and I just put the case to my ear. No, mine doesn't seem to make a "coil whine" noise. 
-The irony of it being sold by Apple. 
r/WholesomeApple
I wonder how these fast chargers and fast charging methods impact battery health in general. 

I have the Anker 20K powerbank and started using it on my iPhone 6 Plus 2 years ago. I believe the powerbank can output about 12W.

After 2 years, my 6 Plus can only last for about 3-4 hours of continuous mixed use (web browsing, wireless music, and Reddit). Oddly enough, iOS 11.3 Beta reports its maximum capacity at 89% with the new Battery Health beta feature. 

I have a new phone now and wonder if the fast charging will impact the battery health negatively like it did with my old 6 Plus. 
Basically almost every company that sells on Amazon does these "sales" where it's literally the original price of the product in the first place. 
What's PD?
I never understood how Apollo took the Reddit world by storm. I literally see almost everyone praising it that it almost seemed like a sham. Perhaps I should give it a try, though. 
Same experience here. 
May I ask what MacBook model and year you and u/hail_to_the_beef have?
People keep saying that the move to 7000 series aluminum was a response to bendgate, but is it really a last minute choice for Apple to switch materials? 

For what it's worth, the iPhone 6s has definitely been in development even before the iPhone 6 was released. In addition, the Apple Watch, previewed in 2014 (in the same event that showcased the iPhone 6) was already previewed to use the 7000 series aluminum. 

So, it's evident the iPhones are bound to switch from 6061 series aluminum to 7000 series, but not *necessarily* as a response to bendgate. Otherwise, Apple would have created the necessary improvements to existing iPhone 6 units in addition to halting its sales while they work on it‚Äîwhich they never did. 
I feel like there's certainly times where we get brigaded. It's very evident when you check /new or the first few comments in a newly created thread. Seems like there's so much negativity in this place. 

Perhaps the mods of r/iOSbeta can restrict downvoting to subscribers only like what r/apple does (if this is not yet the case)?
Ooh. Nice catch on the Face ID bug. I'm reporting it, make sure you do, too. 

The 3D Touch bug is definitely something I noticed and it's annoying at how my deep presses always get interpreted as a long press, therefore I always accidentally trigger jiggle mode. 
I timed it and this update took exactly 5 minutes on my iPhone X. 
Ok but what are you even doing in here?
I used to hate the notch as well when Apple announced the iPhone X. Now that I own one, I'm honestly surprised at how much I don't mind it. 

Now when I go back to an older iPhone, the bezels at the top and bottom stand out and scream "wasted space" to me more rather than the notch which actually serves a purpose as to why it exists. 
I'm with you on this as well. [I own the Apple In-Ear Headphones](https://store.apple.com/xc/product/ME186FE/A) and their sound signature is analytical which is something I really appreciate for critical music listening. It's unlikely but I'd love for Apple to develop an AirPods style true wireless version of these. 
Honestly, that was my mindset back when they debuted in September 2016. Then I just suddenly realized at how tiring it is to deal with tangled wires and the fact that I don't use earphones while working out for this sole reason alone.

In January 2017, I decided to order them online with the intention to return them after the 14 day period, but I didn't; I'm still rocking them 14 months later and getting over how they look + giving up on tangled wires are some of the best decisions I've made lately. 
Why woule Apple remove the stem? Where would they put the battery and antenna if they did? Unless they look like one of those bulky Bluetooth earphones from Anker for example, but then again those lack the insides specific to the AirPods. 
I may be wrong but hasn't Apple been making the glass stronger for almost every year since the iPhone 6? And when making the glass stronger, comes the cost of reduced scratch resistance. 

Also, a lot of people seems to be confusing deep scratches in the glass (the ones you can feel when you run your finger through it), compared to the micro-scratches in the oleophobic coating. 
Not all iOS devices are as heavy as the 12.9 inch iPad, so most iOS devices are still likely to be yanked off flying even with a magnetic charging cable. 
The glass hasn't shattered? Where have you dropped them precisely, may I ask?
A reboot fixes this, but yeah this is an annoying UX/UI bug. 
Ooh, TIL!
This whole thing is quite complicated. I wonder why they won't just let you purchase a case regardless. 
The case is made out of a hard plastic with a shiny coating. Microscratches are bound to appear even if you just unboxed it. I wouldn't worry about it too much. 

It probably just got inevitably scratched somewhere in the product assembly. 
Yes, I know about that. 

But we were discussing what will happen after December 2018, when the battery prices will go back to $79 and customers can only avail replacements only if they have a <80% battery wear. 
Unrelated but do these WebView apps use the Nitro JavaScript engine?

Last I heard it's limited to Safari and the Safari View Controller. 
Three finger drag should be enabled by default. I don't know why that's not the case. 
It's probably the lack of a better rule. It's also probably because it's to prevent someone from abusing battery replacements. If they didn't impose that 80% rule, someone could eat battery supplies by requesting a new battery every month for example. 

I hate the 80% rule myself. I have an old 6 Plus that only lasts 3‚Äì4 hours with mixed usage (Safari, wireless audio, Reddit). It's on iOS 11.3 Beta and it reports the Maximum Capacity as 89%. 4 fucking hours. For reference, it used to last up to 8‚Äì10 hours but that was a few years ago running iOS 8/9. 

Apple could theoretically impose a 1 battery per year limit for example if a customer demands to considering we're willing to pay for a fee anyway. I hope they consider this. 
I'm starting to believe the problem is exclusive to the iPhone 6 series as well. 

I can't reproduce the problem anymore even on my iPhone X, but I think it may still be worth it if we file a bug report for it!
I used to experience a respring on my 6 Plus with the first 11.3 Beta whenever I go inside a chat and tap the text box. Once the keyboard pops up, my phone will respring. 

Have you tried basic troubleshooting methods such as re-installing the app, and or restoring your phone?

The bug suddenly stopped persisting for me and I can't reproduce it anymore. 
Tap to wake doesn't even need a deep press. Just a touch of a finger will wake the iPhone X.  
As someone without an Apple Store in my location, I envy you. We have to rely on third party Authorized Service Providers, and while the experience is Apple-like, the wait times are about 3-4 weeks for product replacements. 
Wasn't there an article that says the HomePod dynamically adjusts it's EQ?

Perhaps that doesn't work when using AirPlay?
That's a cute wallpaper. 
Been seeing a lot more of these threads pop up lately. 

I got my AirPods in January 2017, used them up to 16 hours  on the heaviest days, so I am definitely a heavy user. 

Noticed the parity between the two pods get wider since I got them. Just a few weeks ago, my left pod would die after 2 hours and my right pod would still have ~50%. 

I had them replaced a few days before the warranty expired, perhaps you can attempt to get them replaced, too. 
Banking apps and Safari Autofill are good examples. 
Yes, unfortunately. 

[Here's a screenshot of the old compare iPhones screen back in March 2016. ](https://i.imgur.com/yFjLAGW.jpg)
> the reason I still have my 6 Plus is for video recording, since it got OIS

Hate to break it to you, but OIS on the 6 Plus only works in Photos. 

Apple added the ability for OIS to work on videos on the 6s Plus and onwards. 

All iPhone models since the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus has software based cinematic video stabilization, though. 
r/WholesomeAndroid
This was my similar situation, it's just the left AirPod instead. 

You can try to get your right AirPod replaced if they're still under warranty. If they're not anymore, you may still attempt to, and remember to be nice. 
/uj 

yeah it works on phones because we have tiny space and it works to maximize the overall footprint of the display. On notebooks, it just looks broken aesthetically and literally serves no purpose at all. 
What gave you the impression that improving the hinge is taking all of their efforts, therefore reducing the ability to innovate other aspects of the MacBook?
Of course, but for some people, they were definitely comparing at how faster Touch ID is to unlock the device and it's a valid complaint. After all, Apple introduced Raise to Wake (and Rest Finger to Open) in iOS 10 for select devices to quickly check the lock screen without flying past through it with Touch ID authentication. 


I definitely want to see a wider angle for the second generation Face ID tech as well as speed improvements.

Previous iPhone 6s or 7 owners have been spoiled by the fast speed of Touch ID 2, that it just flies past the lock screen. Now with a swipe up gesture required to go Home, the delay of authentication is certainly felt in Face ID and I'd love to see this eliminated in the future. 
It's now back on sale. 
The Taptic Engine, especially on the 7 and newer, is actually nice though.

Apple would make a really nice vibrator. 
While I'm all here for more RAM, it may actually impact battery life in a negative aspect. On the other hand, adding more RAM should not excuse Apple from optimizing iOS further back to iOS 6 levels. 
So it's basically an iPhone 6/Plus scenario once again where the devices were limited to 1GB of RAM like its predecessor coupled with a buggy OS resulting in subpar UX. üò™

I say this as a previous iPhone 6 Plus owner. 
It gets really confusing when people misuse the two terms. They are quite different things. 

1. Lag is delay when you tap an app and it takes 1-2 seconds to launch.

2. Stutter is when an animation skips frames to complete in pre-determined time. 

3. Sometimes it's a combination of the two.
Forreal though iOS 11 messed up with RAM Management big time, however. 

I upgraded from a 6 Plus to a X and I was honestly expecting RAM management to be better. I'm still just glad my phone can hold more than 2-3 apps when multitasking, though. 
May I ask what device? I can only imagine this problem would be worse on the X. 
Bookmarking this thread when Apple doesn't drop the 5s in iOS 12. 
I was so confused by this whole thread. 
If you happen to stream tracks, they're cached. Apple Music is supposed to purge the cache every once in a while, but it doesn't always work. 

If you like, you can disable, then re-enable your iCloud Music Library in Music settings. Do note this will remove all music you previously downloaded offline as well. 
I'm not a Watch owner but I wonder where the heck does the Watch get its power that it lasts so long even if it physically has a ~200mah battery. 
> Whereas the standard size phone was easily a 1 handed phone and the plus was 2 handed, the X is best used with 1 and a half hands - something I found frustrating. It‚Äôs neither here or there.

Different people, different use cases. When I saw Reachability being demoed in the September 2014 keynote during the iPhones 6 and 6 Plus Introduction, I knew Apple didn't abandon one handed use. 

I can also use the X one handed just fine. Again: different people, different use cases. 
Do you have an Apple Music subscription?
> however it seems as though the preview is bugged.

Which is odd because that has been the case since 2015. 
Of course Face ID will improve overtime. It's currently a new technology at its infancy. 

There have already been rumors surfacing around a few months ago which says the TrueDepth camera system will take up less space by combining some of the components in it, and another rumor suggesting that future iterations of the TrueDepth camera system will be more power hungry than the current iteration. 
> Also when Craig had to use two hands to do a gesture on the Magic Mouse do demonstrate a new feature. 

Are you talking about the "Back the Mac" October ~~2011~~ 2010 keynote? Because if so, Craig was visibly shaking and he was sweating and his whole demonstration was just painful to watch. 

I'm glad at how he bounced back after that and I look forward seeing him on stage for every Apple Event. 

edit: it was is 2010 oops üò¨ 
Why are you so condescending?

Scams are getting tougher and tougher to decipher. Can't you just appreciate the heads up?
You're looking for an iPhone SE with an edge-to-edge display. 
If the TrueDepth camera is an annoyance for you, honestly, I can say as an owner that it doesn't bother me as I originally thought it would. 
The thing is Siri was actually quite good a few years ago. 


It could understand the context of what I'm saying and follow around different topics after I change what I'm saying. Now it only gives me a generic "Search Google" fallback when it doesn't understand me. 

I don't know why Siri regressed like that. 
Yes this is what I've learned as well.

You *don't* have to necessarily swipe down from the extreme bottom of the display. You can swipe down even a couple of millimeters above the home indicator and the system will interpret it as a gesture for Reachability. 
I guess this notification is new to Beta 3. 

In Beta 2, it didn't notify me of this once my phone experienced a sudden shutdown. 
This is so head-scratchingly inefficient. 
As far as I know, Apple cracked them down the past few months. 

Most updated "VPN-based" content blockers now only use DNS-based ad-blocking which is still system-wide but it happens on-device instead. 
My head hurts goodnight
I honestly wish we could have a subreddit dedicated to discussing the Apple ecosystem devoid of people like the person you replied to. 

r/Android kind of makes me happy for the civil discussions they have there sometimes. 
I've been literally getting these as early as November last year. 
Yeah, but for some angles, it **still** won't work despite entering my passcode. I'm better off hitting cancel and swiping up again and adjusting my phone slightly to capture my face. 
That's what Apple did since 2004. 

2004: Original Apple In-Ear

2008: Second generation Apple In-Ear

2012: EarPods 

2016: AirPods
Ah I see your point. 

I had the splash screen appear to me after I forces quit the music app due to an odd internet connection error.

I agree it does get annoying if the splash screen gets shown up when the Music app is purged from memory regardless if we force quit it or not. 
Why do you force quit your apps tho
It showed up to me when I force quit, then relaunched the Music app. 


It takes you to the Apple Music Profile. 
I got my X 1 week ago and the exact same thing happens to me. 

I'm aware that iPhones always charge rapidly at anywhere below 80% and when it gets to 80%, it trickle charges to save battery cycles. But the problem is as stated in the OP, the battery percentage never increases until a few hours, sometimes even overnight. 

OP, kindly let me know what happens after your call with AppleCare. 
Been there since iOS 11.3 Beta 1, actually. 
Using that logic, you'd be surprised to find out that an iPhone display still works if it has minor cracks. 
I have an old iPhone 6 Plus still on its original battery and the Design Capacity coconutBattery reports ranges from anywhere between 52% ‚Äì 89%. 

I installed iOS 11.3 Beta on it and it reports that its maximum capacity is 89%. 

That thing only lasts 3 - 4 hours on mixed use (Reddit, Music, Safari). Either iOS is being conservative reporting battery wear or the battery has literally gone shit. 
No. There would be no way to have that "feature" disabled if the iPhone was bought from Japan. 

Source: I have an aunt who have an iPhone bought from Japan. 
Do you happen to have a source for this? I'd love to read more about background analytics for iOS beta versions. 
I think this is specific to the EU regulated countries. 
I don't understand why iPads don't appear to be as easily repairable as iPhones. Or even have screws at the bottom for easy display disassembly. 

Perhaps someone with knowledge can provide an input based on the current iPads repairability. 
Heck I even heard stories from here where people from third party resellers would even argue with us customers that it's called the "eks" instead of "ten". ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Wow. I'm just surprised because whenever I put my 6 Plus my pocket, it demands to be felt. 

The whole rice thing is a myth and you're more likely to damage the phone since tiny particles might seep into the microscopic openings. 

You're better off using a silica gel and dry the phone out for a couple of days. 
It's still there. If you tap the top right corner of the Music platter in Control Center, it will take you straight into the source selection toggle. 

There's just a bug since the first iOS 11.3 Beta where the indicator disappears. 
If this ever gets solved, which I hope it does, kindly let us know about the culprit for that VPN icon!
Any chance he has a VPN-based adblocker installed?
Oh wow. I saw and upvoted those two posts before. 

I'll probably remember your username now. Also hoping no more future problems on your X!
May I ask what manufacturing defects did you encounter with your iPhone X?
I got the Space Gray X last week and I'm worried about the PVC coating peeling off on mine. 

I fear that such cosmetic damage wouldn't be honored under warranty by Apple Authorized Service Providers since we don't have Apple Stores here. 
Besides, who doesn't like the haptic feedback?
> joke button
This is basically just what I did in my one year of AirPods ownership. 
It's a feature added back in iOS 5. As you've correctly guessed, it's indeed for cleaning app cache and other temporary data especially when you're starting to run low on storage. 
[Since iOS 5, actually.](https://www.cultofmac.com/136741/why-do-ios-5-apps-sometimes-say-they-are-cleaning-themselves/amp/)
To make matters worse, the last release 11.2.5 explicitly said in the release notes that the bug has been fixed. It's really not as seen by complaints here and it's even present in the latest iOS 11.3 Beta. 
I didn't explicitly say that snapstreaks are the only thing I use Snapchat for. 
It really sounds silly no matter how I try to justify that if you've done it more than 400 days with a couple of people, it's still gonna be weird losing that streak. 
I'm sorry they were so rude to you. People on Reddit can be so horrible at times. 
I think it's the display, too! I've only had the X for over a week, but going back to my 6 Plus that I used for 3 (!!) years, I cannot help but feel like the content I view is letterboxed by the massive bezels. 
Got the AirPods last late January 2017. I used mine daily from around. 10-16 hours on the heaviest days. 

I noticed a very visible degradation with the left AirPod only lasting ~2 hours from the original 3.5 hours when I first got it. The right AirPod can still last at about 4 hours, down from the original 5 hours. 

I went to an Authorized Apple Reseller to replace it before the warranty expired and they seemed nice enough to cover it under warranty. 

I guess long term users who didn't notice degradation on the battery aren't using them as heavy as I did, which would totally degrade the AirPods battery in a very noticeable manner. 
Do you notice any improvements if you tried to forget, then re-pair the AirPods again?
There needs to be more people like him in this world. 
My favorite since iOS 9: use two fingers in the keyboard and it will turn into a super accurate cursor for panning around blocks of text. 
I guess for some people that's appealing. 

Since the case manufacturers aren't licensed to have the Apple logo printed out on their products, an opening is their best bet. 

But yeah, it's just another way to get shit stuck in the back of the phone that could potentially end up getting the device scratched if not cleaned. 
I believe the Apple Store offers a standard 1 year warranty even for accessories, so it may be worth a shot asking for a replacement considering their cost. 

Leather, however is not a durable material. 
Perhaps give the official Apple Leather Case a go. 
I find it ironic how this is the best iOS 11 I installed on my old 6 Plus. It's almost smooth and generally acceptable in there regardless of its age. 

I got an iPhone X last Sunday and it's indeed riddled with UI bugs. The biggest offenders are the haptic feedback randomly disappearing and Control Center stutters at times whereas iOS 11.3 Beta 2 made it so smooth on my old 6 Plus. 
What's really odd is that it's listed as fixed in iOS 11.2.5 final release notes, yet I still experience the problem on 11.3 Beta 2. 
Doesn't the HomePod have a vent that's possibly a microphone at the bottom which helps detect the surroundings from where you placed it in your room?
Apple has been "hiding" the camera bumps in their iPhone 6 promotional photos ever since it debuted. 
r/nottheonion
Eagerly anticipating the TIFU post. 
Apple introduced a discounted battery replacement program which reduced battery replacement costs from $79 to now only $29.

The problem is, most people taking advantage of this right now are generally unaware that this program is available until December 2018 so they're taking up a lot of Apple Store concerns. 
I agree with the scratches. 

I handled a year-old display model recently and the scratches are damn difficult to find unless you're pointing at extreme angles. Which is quite amazing since it was a display model where lots of people were handling it in the first place. 

The jet black is truly one of the best‚Äîif not the best‚Äîlooking iPhone ever. 
You have the iPhone 7 and it has the second gen, faster, Touch ID, so speed shouldn't be a problem. 

Touch ID is supposed to improve overtime as it remembers more surface area of your fingerprint the more you use it. 

Perhps you can try this in Touch ID settings and keep tapping the Home button with your finger repeatedly while moving it around slightly each time. 

If the problem persists, perhaps the Apple Store could accommodate the issue. This isn't the first time I've read about someone having this problem. 
Is this Android?
Haha, I don't mind it! I babble a lot. 

You remind me so much of the fun times I had with my 1st gen iPad mini. It was my first ever personal iOS device until I got myself a 6 Plus which essentially became my main form of consuming media, even using it instead of my PC for productivity if I can afford to do so.

The landscape estate and battery life is something I miss on my X. 
Unrelated, but I have both the Apple Leather Case for both my X and 6 Plus. 

For some reason, iPhone X with the Leather case feels heavier than the 6 Plus with the Leather case as well. 

This strikes me as really odd because the X has a smaller overall form factor than the Plus, so it should feel lighter, but it's not. Perhaps, the X's "European Leather" is heavier than the 6 Plus' "Natural Leather"?
It's just how technology evolves. New features get introduced every year which demand more from the system compared to the previous iOS iteration. 

There's also the lack of optimization and bugs which usually gets fixed towards the end of a software version's lifecycle. 

Third party apps also experience a similar scenario where when it gets updated, you can expect it best optimized for the latest devices. 
Unrelated, but I can say that 11.3 got quite smooth on my old 6 Plus. The main noticeable difference from this beta was that Control Center is now generally smooth unless you invoke it in certain places where there's still a lot of gaussian blur involved, like the app switcher and widgets screen. Bringing down the cover sheet is still pretty much a stutter-fest though, even if the device is running at peak performance. 

Oddly enough, Control Center on the same beta is quite choppy on my X. 
Not much about thinness personally, but more about weight. 

The 8 Plus is 202 grams and my old iPhone 6 Plus is 172 grams and it gets kinda tiring handling it for hours tbh even caseless. 

I ultimately ended up getting the X. 

Similar story with my MacBook Air. It's so much nice to have a slim and light laptop on my back while walking compared to the previous refrigerator windows PC I had for the last few years. 
Not even in 11.3 Beta 2. 

Maybe it'll be fixed in iOS 12. 
iCloud backups only include *app data*, **not** the .ipa app packages themselves. 

When you restore a new phone from an iCloud backup, your phone will download the latest version of all apps you have installed from your previous phone one by one. 

tagging u/TotallyLegitPopsicle
I'd wager you can try via bugreport.apple.com if this still happens by the next beta seeds. 
Battery is exactly a component you should worry about when being replaced by a third party.

They are more likely to expand, blow up, or cause other hazards. It's important to have a reputable replacement if you choose to use a third party battery. 
But no protector on the back?
Not OP, but if I just break one myself, I can see myself simply using a skin to cover it up. 

Alternatively, you can try looking for a really transparent plastic/gel/silicone case to at least offer some impact protection when that inevitable moment of accidental drop occurs. 
I've always known this, but it never struck to me that I can also swipe left to access the camera. 

Still faster to access it via the control center, though on non-iPhone X devices. 
One thing I learned is that you don't have to explicitly slide down from the Home indicator. 

You can swipe down a few millimeters above the Home indicator and Reachability will still work. 
> Now how the hell do I just control my phone's music as a remote. All I have been able to do is play from the watch..

It's coming in the next Watch OS 4.X update. 
I mean, the AirPods case with the AirPods inside is heavier than your usual dental floss case. 

If you're just here to condescend, you're better off not saying anything in a thread where you're not really contributing anything helpful. 
The iPhones 6/Plus and iPad 3 are the worst products in their own categories IMO. 

The iPhone 6 was doomed since day 1 due to being limited to the same amount of RAM as an iPhone 5/c or a 5s. Not to mention the CPU/GPU improvements it got was so damn marginal compared to the 5s, so it's bound to perform worse due to driving a whole lot more pixels especially on the 6 Plus. 

A similar scenario haunts the iPad 3. Apple did double the amount of RAM and GPU performance vs the iPad 2, but it did not, however, make improvements on the CPU which is the concern of running 4x more pixels than its predecessor. 

Wow I don't own a X so I didn't know it had a feedback when you evoke Reachability. 
I mean what did you expect to be talked about when discussing an iOS release?
It contains all information regarding Apple products, services and such. 
It's probably because the Pencil can detect the amount of pressure you press it on to the iPad's glass so it can report how hard you're pressing back to the iPad. 

Apple was just probably testing to mimic 3D Touch features internally but for some reason didn't get to disable those in the early betas. 
The advertised music listening time is up to 5 hours. 

For talk time, it's even less with an advertised time of only up to about 2 hours. 
With iOS 11.3 Beta 1, the power management feature was disabled by default. I had it kick in when my 6 Plus suffered a sudden shutdown. Since the new Battery Health setting is not available in iOS 11.3 Beta 1 yet, my phone remained throttled until today's release of 11.3 Beta 2. 

In iOS 11.3 Beta 2, Apple says that the aforementioned power management feature is disabled by default. It will only kick in if you have experienced a sudden shutdown. So meaning, if you've never had a sudden shutdown, your device will not be throttled until then. 

Perhaps Apple should have a way of giving an opportunity to disable the power management feature for people who never experienced such sudden shutdowns. 
Not working here either. I'd wager this is just a bug for this build. 
I'm just curious why "Home & Lock Screen" says "SpringBoard" in the screenshot. 
I guess Apple is emphasizing their previous statements whey they said "that the power management feature only kicks in when needed". 

Previously, it throttles devices permanently and the only solution to get rid of it is to get a new battery. Now, it seems like the throttling won't kick in until the device experiences a sudden shutdown. 

Therefore, a device can still run at full speed even with a worn battery. 
[My device shows an 89% battery wear according to the Battery settings page.](https://i.imgur.com/3KnTu3S.jpg)

However, [coconutBattery for Mac shows about 85.4%](https://i.imgur.com/arngsGs.jpg) design capacity and [a third party all says about 86%.](https://i.imgur.com/B1bmjCQ.png)

I find none of these accurate since my phone only runs at 3-4 hours of continuous mixed use, aka Reddit, Safari, & Music. 
Control Center is fucking smooth on a 6 Plus in general. It doesn't stutter anymore as much when bringing it up/down. It still does stutter if I bring it up on the App Switcher or Widgets screen, but it's generally smoother holy fuck. 

[My device also shows an 89% battery wear according to the Battery settings page.](https://i.imgur.com/3KnTu3S.jpg)

However, [coconutBattery for Mac shows about 85.4%](https://i.imgur.com/arngsGs.jpg )design capacity and [a third party all says about 86%.](https://i.imgur.com/B1bmjCQ.png)
I thought it was just my shitty internet connection or an Adblocker. 
I would have expected this feature to have a graph or even any form of visual indicator, but this is quite straightforward. 

I'm also wondering about the logic behind not being able to re-enable the performance management feature until the iPhone experiences a sudden shut down. 
Pretty sure I've seen this in the changelog last 2 weeks for Beta 1. 
If any of you have Apple Music, it's your streamed music cache. 

Simple go to Settings > Music > iCloud Music Library > turn this setting off then on again. You should almost immediately notice a reduction of storage that's generically described as "System" as seen in the OP's screenshot. 
The watch can still function even without an iPhone in range. Even more functional if you have the LTE models. 
i want a coincidence like this in my life
May I ask if they are deep scratches?

Can you run your nail into them and does your nail tend to get stuck in one of them? Because if it doesn't it's most likely only a scratch in the oleophobic coating. 
Unfortunately, I live in a place without an Apple Store, just Apple Resellers. 

I have the online Apple Store in my country. However, I'm unsure if it offers the same return policy, but if so I'm certain it may take weeks to have my bank account debited because I've had instances of App Store refunds done before and it took about 8 weeks. 
I'm wondering if there is an easy way to determine if a person is sensitive to PWM. 

I've never had an OLED phone before, but I've tested the iPhone X in store, but that time was only limited and not an ideal representation of how my daily life would be with the device. This situation causing medical issues is a serious concern to consider if someone is purchasing a thousand dollar device. 
> Why do they have so many stores in Korea. I'm pretty sure their market share is abysmal there.

Did you even read the article or even the title? Apple didn't have a store in Korea until this one opened. 
Wondering if this also affects the X. 
Do you happen to have an Apple Music subscription?
Why is the rotation animation something like 12fps?

Is this on a 6 Plus? Because that's how it is on my device. 
As someone who doesn't on the Watch, may I ask what does the green icon indicate on some days?
This is concerning. 
u/jamesg007 was hypothetically talking about an event in **Spring** (March) 2018 where Apple may provide a demo for iOS 11.3 along with the launch of other products, though their list seems to be not worthy of an event. 

iOS 12 will we previewed in **Summer** (June) 2018 in WWDC. 
This is literally the experience I get on my 6 Plus every day. 

Since you're on a 7, this shouldn't be a regular case. Have you tried to backup & restore?
I wonder if the difference is noticeable. When I rigorously tested the X in store, I did not notice any significant improvements and the Reachability gesture is not as effective as I would have wished. 

I know I can swipe up a little, then immediately swipe down. 
They were *hypothetically* talking about the iPhone 6‚Äôs camera which is an upgrade compared to the one found in the SE/5s. 
The dynamic performance throttling in iOS is only exclusive to the iPhones 6, 6s, 7, SE, 6 Plus, 6s Plus, and 7 Plus, and not OP‚Äôs device which is an iPad Air. 
Unrelated, but if you think about it, the TrueDepth Camera system is what currently lets the iPhone X standout from the sea of bezel-less smartphones. Therefore having a white background is what makes it standout. 
I feel like people who are asking for such seems to only care about having ‚Äúsomething new‚Äù to look at. 

With a major redesign, usuability have to be taken into factor. One of the major selling points of iOS is the simplicity and ease of use.

For example, with iOS 7 being a major redesign, a lot of skeuomorphic elements were removed and I had to train some non-tech people who were confused which items were tappable and which ones were not due to iOS 7 removing icon borders in its initial release. 
That phone is so dark. I never would have known there was something in there if it wasn‚Äôt for the flash. 
I‚Äôm going to be taking in my AirPods for a replacement this week and it may take 3-4 weeks to receive the replacements. 

I‚Äôm considering buying myself a second pair because they‚Äôre that worth it. 
Yes, but open headphones tend to be large items that go over your head and have significantly large drivers compared to the form factor of the AirPods. 
This is process is called active noise isolation. Currently, the AirPods are advertised to last only 5 hours during music listening and only about 2 hours when used for talk time. 

These estimates should give an idea as to why Apple may have decided against including such active noise cancellation feature as it will significantly reduce music playback time. 
The person I replied to commented about In-Ear earphones which uses silicon tips to provide sound isolation. Sound isolation is a huge factor with regards to delivering better audio performance. 

With the AirPods lacking any form of isolation, it unfortunately impacts the sound quality deliver. 

r/jesuschristreddit
All devices have the same A11 chip, but only the 8 Plus and X have 3GB OF RAM. 

The 8 Plus has an overall larger footprint so it may help dissipate heat better if used without a case, meaning you could have sustained peak performance for slightly longer periods of time than the other 2 devices. 
IEMs. They go inside your ears via silicon ear tips. 

The AirPods do not isolate sound at all. They can only offer so much due to its earbud‚Äôs non-isolating limitation by design. 
Do you have an Apple Music subscription?
I swear I‚Äôve seen a similar thread in this subreddit before. The problem is definitely not unique to OP. 
Started seeing this just in November last year myself ! Pretty cool that it also adds the newly added song to the top of the ‚ÄúRecently Added‚Äù section in the Library page for easy access. 
Used to be self-conscious when I was a new AirPods owner. 

Had mine for almost a year now and honestly, who cares?
Since a previous iOS 11 version (I don‚Äôt remember), it will turn off automatically the first time. But if you turned on Wi-Fi or Bluetooth with Airplane Mode enabled, iOS will remember this and won‚Äôt automatically disable it again. 
I used to see them back in iOS 7, but for some time already, they disappeared and [I made a thread about it 2 months ago and for some people, it was gone as well. ](http://reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7gl3zk/ios_app_store_doesnt_send_updated_apps/)
When I first updated to iOS 11 on my 6 Plus, the Settings.app gap was as wide as the second photo. 

When I did a reset all settings, it restored to the narrower gap in between the items. No idea what caused it in the first place. 
Seems like a legitimate bug. Make sure to report it!
I‚Äôve been using a 6 Plus for almost 3 years now and I can. I mainly wear skinny jeans and I‚Äôm a tiny person. Do note though, that the size of the phone definitely makes it obvious in your pocket and you can feel it in there a lot more compared to the smaller iPhones. 
The Plus models (and the X) has a feature called Reachability that allows you to temporarily access the top parts of the display easily by double tapping‚Äînot press‚Äîthe home button (or slide down the Home indicator on iPhone X). 
It‚Äôs one of my main concerns when I first saw the X‚Äôs keyboard layout. But to be fair, I already disabled Dictation sonce I never used it anyway. 
Thank you for your input. I will, however, miss landscape exclusive features such as the two-pane split view in apps such as Mail and Notes. Safari tabs in landscape is something I‚Äôll definitely miss the most. 
It is taller, but it is narrower. Just because you see 5.8‚Äù vs 5.5‚Äù in the spec sheets doesn‚Äôt mean the iPhone X‚Äôs display is automatically larger. 

You have to take into factor that the X‚Äôs display has an odd aspect ratio. If you convert it into the Plus model‚Äôs 16:9 aspect ratio, you would get an actual surface area of about 5.41‚Äù‚Äîtechnically smaller than the Plus models. 

Also, content will be smaller on the iPhone X due to the narrower display and usable screen area is even less if you consider the screen estate used by the home indicator and the extended status bar to accommodate the TrueDepth Camera system. 
On non-moving home buttons?

Does this also mean it immediately goes into multitasking if you quickly do a second press a la iOS 10?
If you would take a look at previous iOS release patterns, Apple has been consistently increasing iOS support for iPhones with ‚Äús‚Äù phones. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if iOS 12 doesn‚Äôt drop a device in the current supported device lineup. 
Isn‚Äôt that a hardware thing, no?
It‚Äôs a common misconception that the iPhone X has ‚Äútechnically‚Äù a larger display which is not true. The surface area of the iPhone X if converted into 16:9 aspect ratio is about 5.41‚Äù [if this Reddit post is accurate.](http://reddit.com/r/apple/comments/70wpmt/calculating_the_actual_area_of_the_iphone_x/) Of course, content will also look smaller because the display is narrower. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm also torn if I should go with an 8 Plus or the X. My biggest issue with the Plus models is that sometimes they can feel a little too wide and they are hard to pocket, and most importantly at 202 grams, it‚Äôs the heaviest iPhone ever shipped. 
How are you finding the narrower screen on the X? 

I‚Äôm thinking of upgrading to the X from a 6 Plus, but this a main concern for me. Content will be narrower and tabbed browsing will be non-existent in landscape in Safari. 
I guess it‚Äôs only suitable since it jumped quite a few point releases from 11.2.2. 
The batteries are still probably new and the feature is not yet supported on the 8 and X because it doesn‚Äôt need performance throttling compared that to the iPhones listed above. 

After all, Apple only added the feature in iOS 11.2 for the iPhones 7 and 7 Plus, a few months when the first batch of these devices turned 1 year old. 

If a pattern is to be extracted here, the feature may be supported in iOS 12.2 next year for the iPhones 8 and X. 
God bless 
For streaming music videos. Currently, the UI still has the pre-iOS 11 media player look. 

Also, this provides an opportunity for them to revamp music video discoverability in the Browse page and other similar stuff. 
Apple became the #1 watchmaker in the world, replacing Rolex at the top spot, but ok
May I ask what device do you have?

Edit: Just saw that you have a 7 Plus. That's really odd and should not happen just on a previous flagship device.
On the other hand, hardware performance benchmark does not determine user experience or UI quality.

[Older iPhones have been previously benchmarked as part of a response to a conspiracy theory that Apple intentionally slow down devices overtime.](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/10/06/apple-doesnt-deliberately-slow-older-iphones/)

Take note, this article was published way before the power daemon that helps iOS dynamically adjust system performance became public knowledge.
Still not available for some people I guess, like me. 
That is expected because the AirPods have dynamic drivers. Dynamic drivers require vents and move air by design. 
> Damn, I was planning on getting the X after it dropped in price.

Doesn‚Äôt some places have some old stocks that you can get for a cheaper price regardless if Apple discontinues the iPhone X?

I feel like I need this because using earphones, especially in-ear ones with silicon tips causes my ears to ‚Äúsweat‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen an ENT before, but he didn‚Äôt note anything concerning. And I can‚Äôt find anyone else or a blog post about this specifically when using earphones. 
May I ask how long have you had your AirPods?

Also while we‚Äôre at it, do you know why the insulating tape effectively cleans the dirt that‚Äôs attached to the magnets in the case, whereas a cotton swab with alcohol is pretty useless?
So it‚Äôs basically 2008 all over again. 
That Chinese brand was Vivo and the fingerprint reading area of the display seemed to be limited‚Äîit‚Äôs not embedded in the entire display or even the whole bottom of the phone‚Äîand it‚Äôs also slow. 
I wonder if it also happens on the 8 or 8 Plus when they hit this extremely low battery level. So far, I‚Äôve only read anecdotes like this from iPhone X users. 
That seems to be within the optimal scores according to Geekbench records. Did you also happen to have a battery replacement recently?
System animations and RAM management. 

I have a few friends on a 5s and the system animations can still manage to perform smoothly on iOS 11. The 6 and especially 6 Plus experience stutters notably due to only having minor GPU upgrades despite sporting a significantly higher pixel density from the previous generation. 

Also unrelated, but even back in iOS 10 in 2016, my sister‚Äôs iPhone 5 is consitently smoother than my 6 Plus on the same firmware. 

RAM Management is a given. The 5s sports a significantly lower resolution than both the 6 and 6 Plus, which should let the system render less graphics, therefore have more memory available at all times compared to the two devices. 
But to be fair, in some cases the 5s fares better than the 6 and most especially, the 6 Plus. 
It won‚Äôt wipe your data in the cloud, it will only clear any cached data lingering around on your device as well as any music you have currently downloaded‚Äîwhich you can download once again after you re-enable the feature. 
Can you provide a video? You may also share this via Apple to file a bug report on bugreport.apple.com. 
The last time Apple Music suddenly stopped working for me where all my downloaded music sudddenly disappeared was during one of the betas for iOS 11.2. Sad how this bug from the early days of Apple Music is still here. 

Regarding your system storage, kindly consider going to Settings > Music > then turn off iCloud Music library, then turn it back on. Check to see if it helps. 
Would anyone of you mind checking your CPU frequency using CPU DasherX?

Apple seems to have consciously reduced the intensity of how the phone‚Äôs performance is throttled. 
I would have loved it if the back panel is easily removable, that would have made replacements less expensive if the back is shattered. 
What is this issue with Apollo?
Iiirc it‚Äôs actually a bug during one of the iOS 11.1 betas, but the home indicator wasn‚Äôt really functional. 
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs used or bought in a developing country. Or could be just a really old and unsold unit. 
Is there a chance you could check your dad‚Äôs battery health via coconutBattery? It‚Äôs not the most accurate, but this *may* play into a factor especially if the device is now running iOS 11.2 or later. 

Also, it may be helpful to monitor the CPU‚Äôs clock speed using an app called CPU DasherX. 
How is this possible? I‚Äôm pretty certain the 2 devices both support 100% the sRGB color spectrum. Perhaps it could be the improved contrast ratio and or thinner display assembly?
Genuinely curious why everyone is being downvoted in threads like this. 
On my current 6 Plus, the plastic liner can only be felt on the top left part of my phone.

On the iPhones 8 and 8 Plus I've held, the gap can be felt on the lower back's right side.

They're not all literally in the same position so this seems like an inconsistency in the production since 2014.
Not always. For example, the iPhones SE and 8 have a 326 PPI, while the 8 Plus has a 401 PPI. 
I‚Äôm just surprised that the 6.1‚Äù LCD 2018 iPhone is rumored to have a significantly lower PPI despite being a larger display. 
Yeah it‚Äôs due to that. Similar to the front of the phone, however in some areas, the gap isn‚Äôt as noticeable, which is the cause of my concern. 

In the phones I held, the plastic bumper is easily felt on the right side, but the left side of the phone is practically seamless which is unfortunate since I am right handed. 
Yeah I can. 

I actually own a 6 Plus currently. 

Also, believe it or not, the succeeding phones aluminum (6s, 7, and 8) are *slightly* more grippy because of a different anodization method which makes the 6s and beyond‚Äôs aluminum less prone to moisture. 

The difference is real, but can only be appreciated if you held a 6 and a newer device side-by-side. 
Kind of weird you said that it‚Äôs a slippery phone considering how I would have thought the polished stainless steel + glass back would be like super glue after the extremely slippery aluminum unibody construction of past iPhones. 
I guess you should note that Apple extended the power daemon that dynamically detects battery wear to adjust system performance in iOS 11.2 for the iPhone 7. 

Depending on your overall battery health and some other factors, you may notice a certain degree of reduced performance. 
There‚Äôs replays of it up on YouTube! Just search ‚ÄúApple October 2016 keynote‚Äù. 
This is one of the best features demoed at the keynote back in October 2016!
I can't fathom how the latest and flagship (!!!) iPad currently being sold has this issue. Something is seriously wrong here.
Currently, replacement batteries for every iPhone introduced since 2014 is discounted to $29. This is a one-time special price and this offer is valid until December 2018. 

When you take advantage of this or after December this year, battery replacement prices restore to their original price of $79. 
If this is the case, then I wonder why the performance throttling for improved peak power management is only available for the iPhone 6 and beyond. 
Leave this shit in 2016
How do you measure this? Via Geekbench? I reckon it‚Äôs within the margin of error. 
RAM and every iPhone introduced since 2015 has the NVMe storage controller. 
>  apparently it took a little hit with the Meltdown/Spectre updates.

where have you gotten his info? From Melvin Mughal, the founder of WeCure?

It‚Äôs more likely that his iPhone‚Äôs performance was simply throttled due to three factors: battery health, current battery level, and temperature. 

It‚Äôs possible when he ran the benchmark *before* the Spectre fix, his phone was fully charged. 

When he ran the benchmark *after* the Spectre fix update however, the device may be warm or is not in a fully charged state, therefore intensifying the need for iOS to throttle the device leading to significantly reduced Geekbench scores. 

edit: clarification
I‚Äôve had the 6 Plus since February 2015, this was the first iPhone I bought with my own savings. I can say that this device aged badly. 

It shipped with one of the buggiest iOS versions of all time, it only had 1GB of RAM which made multitasking almost non-existent (especially with Safari), and frame drops were a lot more noticeable in the 6 Plus than on succeeding Plus models, partly due to the significantly increased resolution and the GPU‚Äôs marginal improvement over the iPhone 5s. 
[According to Apple, it‚Äôs $69. ](https://9to5mac.com/2016/12/15/apple-airpod-replacement-price-warranty/amp/)
Yeah I remember an article of Jony Ive saying the iPhone X would be able to do a lot more things next year, presumably with iOS 12. 

I do wonder though, how the phone will fare up with a worn battery once Apple expands support of the power daemon for the iPhone X in the future.  
Do you personally own one? I‚Äôm asking though because I‚Äôm heavily considering the X since I can‚Äôt afford to upgrade on a yearly basis and the X seems to be the future of iPhones.
Weird because iOS 11 is generally 60 fps smooth on a family member‚Äôs iPhone 7. 

Maybe a full backup & restore then update us?
Does this make you anxious? Or are you kinda used to it by now?
A new battery should be able to provide the necessary voltage for your phone‚Äôs processor to run at full speed once again. 

As per Apple‚Äôs explanation, as batteries age, it loses it‚Äôs capability to provide power for peak scenarios which may result in sudden shutdowns. Therefore to prevent the sudden shutdowns, they resort to having the device artificially slowed down‚Äîthe intensity of which varies according to battery health, current battery percentage, and current temperature. 
But then again, there‚Äôs certain posts of people here or on r/apple claiming that the official Apple Store diagnostics still differ from coconutBattery. 
I saw someone already post the same thing, not sure which Apple subreddit, but basically, the same reasoning why Apple slows down performance on the other phones, to keep itself alive instead of shutting down. Probably why this slowdown is also limited to a 1% charge as you‚Äôve mentioned. 
Well this was surprising. 
May I ask your Geekbench scores or your CPU clock speed using an app called CPU DasherX?

I hate how the gestures are opposite on Apple Maps. It‚Äôs so much easier to zoom in dragging your thumb down the screen, than up. 
I think it might be a good idea to record a voice memo of every time you visit the Apple Store when talking to a Genius. Ask for permission first, of course. 

I do this every time I visit an Authorized Apple Service Provider due to a lack of an Apple Store in my location. 
Unrelated but I think there‚Äôs gloves that exist with a unique thumbprint for every glove. 
But how is your battery?
But double tap to wake on the iPhone X requires an OLED panel, and it‚Äôs a marquee feature of the aforementioned iPhone. 
I think people asking for more bass are kind of overlooking the fact that these are open earbuds. 

The AirPods don‚Äôt offer any kind of seal. The bass enhancements that Apple could only offer for such open earbuds is through coloring or artificially enhancing the sound signature. 
The AirPods detect taps using pressure via an accelerometer. Jailbreaks on iOS 10 already show that you can customize a single, double, triple, or even quadruple taps to a unique setting. 

I fail to see how you say a triple tap feature‚Äîif Apple ever implements it‚Äîwould be limited to an updated version of AirPods. 
iirc, they were limited edition as they announced on stage back then. Subsequent interviews also revealed that they were described as Jony Ive‚Äôs ‚Äúbaby.‚Äù
Do you happen to have an Apple Music subscription?
Do note that the iPad mini has a similar pixel density to an iPhone with a 4.7‚Äù or 4‚Äù display. This means that content is just as small on an iPhone in a much larger display. 

If you want, consider the 9.7‚Äù iPad, 10.5‚Äù iPad Pro, or a refurbished 9.7‚Äù iPad Pro. 
Damn there‚Äôs so many keyboard shortcuts. It‚Äôs almost overwhelming. Though I have to admit, they‚Äôre pretty useful and I‚Äôve been discovering them on my own since I owned my first Mac last year. 
Yeah, definitely. It gets tiring to witness this every time a Gallowboob post appears on the front page. 
Apparently the people reporting every Gallowboob post and the subsequent moderator pinned message at the top telling them to stop. 
Is there any reason why it took this long to re-write them? Swift was introduced back in 2014, right? Perhaps they were simply waiting to drop 32-bit support and for the programming language to mature?
Because it‚Äôs not from the original content creator?
Oh wow. This small footprint should also be in Apple‚Äôs official statements and not tucked in the support articles. 
Since no one else is mentioning it, this has always been the behavior since iOS 8.3 and the subsequent iTunes update it shipped back in March 2015. 

I tried to file a bug report via bugreport.apple.com about this years ago, but it just ended up being closed. 
> 3. The blur around the panel when 3D-touching a title in music app still lags sometimes.

May I ask if you happen to know since when this issue has been there, or at least your personal memories of experiencing it first?

I own a 6 Plus myself, so when I tried the music app on a 7 running iOS 11.2.5, this was something I noticed and it was quite annoying as I‚Äôm about to upgrade my device. 
Yikes. Thanks for the response. 

Seems like the usual ‚Äúknown‚Äù issue that usually plagues major body redesigns. 
> I‚Äôve had 2 iPhone X replaced through AppleCare+ already.

Does this mean you‚Äôre already out of replacement? This is considered as a cosmetic issue, right?
> this is one time price reduction

Is this from Apple‚Äôs official statement?
Didn‚Äôt Apple say that the vulnerabilities were already addressed in iOS 11.2?
It shows as ‚ÄúNot Your AirPods‚Äù when opening the case near an unpaired device. 
Same thing happens to me except it‚Äôs the left AirPod. It only lasts 2-2.5 hours now compared to the Right AirPod which can still last as long as 4 hours. 

This is covered by the standard one year warranty. 
Apple doesn‚Äôt provide any battery remark regarding the AirPods charge cycles on their website. May I ask where have you gotten this info?

Also AirPods battery replacements cost $49 each. 
Responses like this are kind of confusing because back when TrueTone debuted on the 9.7‚Äù iPad Pro, I only see praises. 

Perhaps, the criticisms didn‚Äôt come until it reached a more mainstream product?

Also, as far as I know, TrueTone gets automatically disabled on the Photos.app, but I think it‚Äôs limited to that. So there‚Äôs that. 
I‚Äôm wondering why this is exclusive to iPhone 7 and later. 
The right one is out of the case. 
Download the tvOS beta profile (simply Google-able) and your phone will stop automatically downloading the latest iOS update. 


Mind checking what clock speed your 7+ is running via CPU DasherX?
https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/

> Apple is reducing the price of an out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement by $50 ‚Äî from $79 to $29 ‚Äî for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later whose battery needs to be replaced, available worldwide through December 2018. Details will be provided soon on apple.com.
The thing is, this isn‚Äôt a permanent price reduction. 
What device?
Try to hard reset your AirPods by putting them in the case, leave the lid open, press the connect button on the back of the case for 15 seconds until the light flashes amber, then re-pair your AirPods. 
You joke but the iPhone 8 Plus is literally over 200 grams. The weight is quite noticeable. 
Had mine since late January 2017. Use them daily and every moment I could have them on, I use them, which is a lot since I‚Äôm mostly at home. So I tend to use them for 10-12 hours daily. 

I noticed they never really lasted the advertised 5 hours for me. Since the beginning there‚Äôs a huge parity between the two pod‚Äôs battery. My left lasts only about 3.5 hours, while the right lasts about 4 hours. 

Fast forward to today, the left can only last about 2 ‚Äì 2.5 hours, while the right one can still last as long as 4 hours. I‚Äôm definitely getting them replaced before their warranty expires. 

___

In the context of longetivity, unfortunately Apple doesn‚Äôt publish how long or how much capacity of the AirPods is to be expected after a certain number of charge cycles. 

I‚Äôll just take my personal anecdote as a guide to see how they degrade overtime. 

Additonally, you can replace your AirPods for battery issues for $49 each. Personally, I don‚Äôt mind it since I love the AirPods so much that they‚Äôre actually one of the few products I‚Äôll immediately buy again if something ever happens to my current pair.

/s that‚Äôs appended at the end of the comment means sarcasm. You must‚Äôve missed it. 
Is temporary burn-in a thing, though?

Because when I Reddit for way too long, narwhal‚Äôs interface gets stuck for a while on my 6 Plus. 
I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on my sister‚Äôs 7 and its maximum clock speed appears to be 2339MHz. 

When it throttles, especially when it has a low battery percentage, the lowest I‚Äôve seen it is around 2249MHz. It would be interesting to see how low the 7 could go as it‚Äôs battery degrades further in the future. 

Personally, I have a 6 Plus on its original and worn battery and the original clock speed is 1400MHz. But since I have a worn battery, it‚Äôs now permanently throttled at [1127MHz](https://i.imgur.com/wUtccj4.jpg), and sometimes goes as low as [600MHz](https://i.imgur.com/CaviHAU.png) when in a low percentage. 


I call BS. My sister has a 7 with iOS 11.2.5 on 87% capacity as checked via coconutBattery and it sometimes already dips lower than its maximum clock speed. 
Oh so the discounted battery program is also applicable worldwide?
I‚Äôve had mine since January 2017 and I have to agree that the case does feel slippery and I have dropped it a couple of times. 

I still prefer to use it naked, though. It‚Äôs just a plastic case and I won‚Äôt be obsessing about investing in a case to protect a *case*. 
You‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs a world outside of Reddit?
This took me four months to get
Small correction: iPhones are actually only rated to retain 80% of their capacity after **500** cycles. 
I believe the reduced battery replacement prices are for iPhone 6 and later. 
How long have you had your AirPods?
Using your example above, no. 

I‚Äôve done rigorous cardio workouts while wearing the AirPods and they don‚Äôt accidentally trigger the double tap feature. 
It‚Äôs possible you‚Äôre not tapping hard enough. 

Take note, the AirPods are not touch sensitive. They have an accelerometer inside each pod to detect *pressure* so if you only lightly tap them, the designated gesture will not activate. Also as instructed in the manual, the best place to tap is at the top of the AirPods‚Äô stem. Additionally, triple-tapping seems to be a fool-proof solution as someone already mentioned. 
The double taps are detected by an accelerometer inside the AirPods. 

They detect pressure and requires a small amount of force to activate the designated gesture. 
If the battery was a counterfeit one, it would be detected by the system accordingly since it wouldn‚Äôt be able to provide the necessary voltage like an OEM battery would, therefore, you wouldn‚Äôt have a device running at it‚Äôs maximum clock speed. 
If I have to guess, it‚Äôs an intentional battery saving feature. 

Rather than have the entire TrueDepth camera system work constantly to detect attention aware features, only some parts of it work ‚Äî probably only the Infrared camera
People seem to have forgotten about the iPod touch. 
I‚Äôve read other people who were denied of the service as well for the same reason. They‚Äôve had luck insisting for a replacement since it‚Äôs you paying anyway. 
I had this accidentally happen to me, too, last year. I just reported the incident and requested the refund. 

The refund process was pretty straightforward and the support personnel was nice via e-mail so you should be good!
[Dust accumulates there because it‚Äôs where the magnets are at. ](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/f3k1ysoFjvJ5xoF5)
Thanks. I just didn‚Äôt know what query I should be looking for since it‚Äôs way too early for me to Reddit. 
lmfao i got asked this a few times too!
I‚Äôve had them for almost a year and I still wonder why people sometimes stare. 
If anything, I really think the 6s will age well. 

First of all, I perceive iOS 12 to be mainly a bug-fix release *and* a version not to drop a device in the supported lineup similar to previous iOS release patterns like iOS 6 and iOS 9. 

Also, the iPhone 6s has the fast storage controller so if anything will kill it, it‚Äôs definitely the combination of a worn battery and the power daemon dynamically adjusting system performance. 
Do you happen to have a source? I‚Äôd love to read an article about this. 
The Plus models, too. I would know because my 6 Plus experiences the issue and it also has a throttled clock speed. 
Probably. 
I‚Äôve had my AirPods since January and literally dust quickly accumulated in the area where the magnets are within weeks. 
In some parts of the world, they are being sold as a low-cost option. 

Also from the article:

> Additionally, the prevalence of older models can be attributed to their affordability outside the U.S., Flurry noted. 
You can double tap an AirPod while it‚Äôs in your ear to either answer or end a call. 
Don‚Äôt mind them. They were really rude and honestly, I think some people would benefit from this post. üëçüèº
I tried this on an Android and it was quite annoying. The vibration was loud and honestly just straight up something I would end up disabling as it‚Äôs superflous. 

But to be fair, the device doesn‚Äôt have the Taptic Engine so I can‚Äôt say how I‚Äôll feel about it until Apple implements it. 
Well that‚Äôs nice to hear.

Here‚Äôs to hoping they‚Äôll still review the new iPhones. I‚Äôve always looked forward to their in-depth reviews since the iPhone 6s in 2015. 
Afaik, there‚Äôs no official announcement. However, it‚Äôs literally been months since Apple released the new iPhones and we don‚Äôt even have news if a review is coming out from them. Also, they didn‚Äôt review the Touch Bar MacBooks. 

If anything, Apple poached the founder from them so basically, it seems like no one from Anandtech is interested in Apple anymore. 
Ugh. I just wish Anandtech didn‚Äôt stop revieweing Apple products. 
Just the light colored ones fade, though. 

I have the black leather case for my 6 Plus and I quite like it. 
I‚Äôm honestly just surprised that it still works with *that* look. 
I‚Äôm interested to know as well. 

As far as I know, the two phones have the exact same front facing camera components, however I wonder if the Image Signal Processor on the A11 chip does anything new to improve selfies taken on the new phones. 
The power management feature that Apple added for iPhones 6/s/Plus in iOS 10.2.1, and iOS 11.2 for the iPhone 7/Plus is a different state. 

First off, we have full performance state, wherein the iPhone is neither in low power mode, nor artificially throttled due to a degraded battery, and is completely running at full speed. 

Second, Low Power Mode is a temporary user-enabled setting that reduces CPU clock speed and reduces some animations which means the GPU is affected as well. This animation reduction effect is noticeable in the QuickType keyboard for example wherein the suggestions won‚Äôt animate as they change as you type. 

Third, is the recent throttling feature that Apple spoke about. In this mode, iOS dynamically adjusts the CPU clock speed depending on battery wear based on **both** battery health **and** current charge level percentage. Apparently, Apple says this is done to compensate for peaks that the processor can draw which can cause your device to suddenly shutoff especially if your battery is already worn.

The big difference though between Low Power Mode and this artificial throttling state is that Low Power Mode is user-enabled, whereas this third, throttling state is determined by iOS‚Äô power management system and compensates dynamically based on battery wear and current charge level. 
I love Canada
May be worth to give them a hard reset. 

To do so, place both AirPods in the case, leave the lid open, then press and hold the pairing button on the case for at least 15 seconds until the light indicator flashes amber. 
I guess I‚Äôm definitely in the minority when I say I prefer the new, unworn look. 
Regarding your edit, I believe it was back in iOS 8. 
If you look at the Weather.app, at the bottom you‚Äôll see the source. Just like in the screenshot OP posted. 
Because the Weather app feeds data off of them?
Can I be adopted 
Has anyone ever truly utilized that? I keep seeing people who actually own one say they just disabled it because the screen is too yellow. 

Also, looking at side by side comparison videos on Youtube, the 8‚Äôs LCD has a warmer temperature even with True Tone disabled. 
I can‚Äôt even have adult entertainment last me more than 5 minutes
If you‚Äôre on iOS 11 and you have been disabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth using the Control Center, this is the expected result. 

Actually, ‚Äúdisabling‚Äù Wi-Fi and Bluetooth via Control Center does not exactly turn off the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radio chips for the sole reason of not disabling certain features like AirDrop and connectivity with an Apple Watch. 

If you wish to completely turn off the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios, you can only do this via the Settings app.

/uj Why the 8 Plus?
I always thought with the current limitations in technology, we‚Äôd go full circle and have glass backs again because of wireless charging. 

There‚Äôs only so many ways to make a phone. It can be viewed that with the iPhone X, we‚Äôve nearly perfected the rectangle. 

Obviously, some will say the notch could be removed or miniaturized, but being a little more forward thinking, the next logical thing would be a technology that‚Äôs a lot more invisible and is embedded that follows us everywhere. 
Yes, that‚Äôs the app developer. Also, I just looked it up through Google search results and it now says the app costs $1. The app developers probably did this during this whole commotion, unfortunately. It‚Äôs still a worthy, cheap investment IMO. 
I just looked it up through Google search results and it now says the app costs $1. The app developers probably did this during this whole commotion, unfortunately. 
Is it possible you‚Äôre confusing it with a similarly named app called ‚ÄúCPU Dasher64‚Äù from the same developer?

Otherwise, they may have started to include a price for CPU DasherX since this whole commotion. 
Agree with your statements, although I have to comment that the throttling feature is already being utilized for the iPhone 7. As you said, some iPhone 7 units have already aged past a year and the [images in the Geekbench blog post](https://www.geekbench.com/img/blog/2017/iPhone%207%20-%2011.2.0.png) is already an indication. 
Can‚Äôt find a source right now, but what u/Eddytion said is accurate. One speaker handles the lower frequencies, and the other one handles the highs, hence the perception of some channel imbalance. 
Finally someone who looks back at previous iOS support patterns as well. 
1) Yes. I recommend them, I‚Äôve had them since early 2017 and I can honestly say they‚Äôre the best purchase I made this year. 

They offer no **active noise cancellation** since that would require the mic to work at all times and that would be taxing on the battery. No **passive noise isolation** is available either since they don‚Äôt come with silicon tips. 

2) So far any news about an official update to the AirPods have been rumors. Which means they might not even be updated next year. Personally, if something ever happens to my current AirPods, say they get destroyed or lost, they‚Äôre one of the few thing I‚Äôd immediately purchase again in a heartbeat. 
By cooling fans, do you mean active fans and not some fancy way of passive heat dissipation?

Also, do you happen to know if Belkin wireless chargers also employ this technology? I may be wrong, but as far as I know, only these 2 brands support the faster 7.5W charging spec. And if Belkin doesn‚Äôt, I guess the choice just got easier for consumers. 
Odd. The reason I asked is because iCloud Music Library does not clear the cache of music you‚Äôve streamed until you‚Äôre low on storage. 

Other apps‚Äô caches are probably causing this. They should automatically be purged. However if this doesn‚Äôt work, a backup and restore should do the trick‚Ä¶ until this issue happens again. 
Do you happen to have Apple Music?
I think a better comparison would be with another iPhone 7 Plus, and not an entirely different device with different components. 
What firmware is it on? I remember on earlier versions of iOS 11, my phone would re-alert me of every unread messages I‚Äôve had every time I did a restart.
If you replacement battery was a counterfeit one, the battery may not be capable of providing the necessary voltage for the CPU to return to its original clock speed. Take note that temperate is also a factor in CPU throttling. 
~~Yes, CPU DasherX is free.~~

EDIT: I just looked it up through Google search results and it now says the app costs $1. The app developers probably did this during this whole commotion, unfortunately. 
I don‚Äôt think I can recommend Lirium to check my actual CPU clock speed. 

When I downloaded it, it showed my iPhone 6 Plus was running at 1400MHz which is obviously false since I have a worn battery. Comparing it against CPU DasherX, the latter is more accurate and does show your device‚Äôs current CPU frequency. 
If you have an iOS device on iOS 11 with Touch ID:

Go to Settings > Notifications > Show Previews > then select ‚ÄúUnlocked‚Äù. 

Now, go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Home Button > then disable the ‚ÄúRest Finger to Open‚Äù setting. 

Now whenever you wake your iOS device using Raise to Wake or the side button, it won‚Äôt show notification previews anymore by default unless you put your finger in the fingerprint scanner. 
Earlier versions of iOS 11 did have this bug, though. Even if you tap ‚ÄúShow More‚Äù, you‚Äôll still only see 2 devices and a blank space beneath the second one. 


tagging u/bvsel
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but this is also possible with the other iPhones, right? Albeit some tinkering in Notification settings and disabling ‚ÄúRest finger to unlock‚Äù?
Most probably ‚ÄúTouch Disease‚Äù. There‚Äôs a recall program that‚Äôs exclusive for the iPhone 6 Plus. [Check to see if you‚Äôre within the recall period. ](https://www.apple.com/support/iphone6plus-multitouch/)
Alternatively, using a free app called CPU DasherX shows your device‚Äôs current clock speed. 
Historically, major MacBook Pro generation updates happen every 4 years. 

We had the second generation model in 2008, Retina Display in 2012; and Touch Bar update in 2016. It makes sense that a major update might come in 2020. 
What device did you test this with?
May I ask what your is your device‚Äôs clock speed if you check it via CPU DasherX?
I mean [Apple recently spoke](http://reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7l3niu/apple_addresses_why_people_are_saying_their/) about how they added the ‚Äúthrottling feature‚Äù for the iPhone 7/Plus in iOS 11.2, right? That‚Äôs only a year within the device‚Äôs lifecycle and Apple may have seen fit that it was time they implement this feature now. 

They also explicitly said that this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù is coming in future devices. It‚Äôs bound to slow down the CPU of the current iPhones 8 and X probably in next year‚Äôs iOS 12.2. 
OP, I think you may get more responses if you repost this in r/Android. 
I think the iPhone 3GS has been vintage for quite some time now. 
Forreal though, I still have a functional 3GS from 2009 with a worn battery, of course. However, it never experienced sudden shutdowns and best of all, it still runs in its initial clock speed.
Fun fact iPhones didn‚Äôt use to have 500 charge cycles until 2014 when the iPhones 6 and 6 Plus were introduced. Older iPhones only stored up to 80% of their capacity until only 400 charge cycles. 
Oh yes. I wasn‚Äôt doubting you, I know about that support page. Apologies if it came out that way. 
A few thoughts:

1) I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that a lot of phones suddenly started having shutdown issues just last year. The iPhones 6 and 6 Plus was already 2 years old by the time, but the iPhones 6s and 6s Plus were only a year old and they both experienced this at the same time. 

2) This begs the question, why hasn‚Äôt this happened before? Why aren‚Äôt older devices like the iPhone 4s or iPhone 5 experiencing these random shutdowns? I‚Äôve seen some cases of the iPhone 5s before, but they weren‚Äôt as apparent as the 6/s/Plus models. 

3) Further expanding on point number 2: has Apple simply been pushing silicon demand for the past couple of years‚Äîonly accelerated with the iPhones 6s/Plus‚Äîthat battery technology hasn‚Äôt kept up with it yet? Which in turn, they have to resort to doing things like this?

4) Since Apple only recently came clean about how they added this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù in iOS 11.2 for the iPhone 7 and how they said they plan to add this in future devices, should they add a disclaimer on their current product‚Äôs pages that it‚Äôs bound to be slower in a year unless they replace the battery?
I have a worn battery and an obviously throttled device and I *still* experience the sudden shutdown issue, but I don‚Äôt have any message in the Battery page of Settings.app indicating that my battery needs replacement as you‚Äôve mentioned. 
Actually, if it‚Äôs a counterfeit battery, it wouldn‚Äôt be able to supply the necessary voltage like a legitimate battery would. Therefore, even if you have a new counterfeit battery, you won‚Äôt be benefiting from a throttle-free device. 
I‚Äôm wondering myself why this happens in the first place. 

Has Apple been pushing past the limits of silicon in the past few years that battery technology isn‚Äôt there yet so they have to resort to ‚Äúfixes‚Äù like this?

Should Apple also include a disclaimer in their product pages that the devices they offer are bound to be slower once the batteries degrade until it‚Äôs replaced?

A little more transparency and a little less vagueness could have reduced the drastic overreaction over this, to be frank.
> Seems like this needs to be tested ASAP. 

This whole thing started when a redditor posted a PSA online alleging noticeable speed improvements once they replaced the battery on an iPhone. 

[This is the original thread. ](https://reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/7inu45/psa_iphone_slow_try_replacing_your_battery/)
Lmfao no. Before you accuse me of not reading release notes, I did indeed read the release notes and I was pretty much involved in this incident almost a year ago since my device experiences the random shutdown issue. 

Yes, Apple did interviews, they did press releases. But then again their statements have been intentionally vague until only recently in which they explicitly stated that they indeed added a power daemon that‚Äôs responsible for throttling CPU performance which is something they should have acknowledged **specifically** in the first place. 

Again, this whole issue sparked interest due to a noticeable speed improvement once a battery was replaced. This isn‚Äôt something users have to find out for themselves. Apple should have straight up told their customers to replace their batteries as they are going to be having throttled devices until then. And now they only came clean at how they also plan to add this feature in future products. 
> Apple was very transparent

Were they, though? Did they explicitly tell me that from then on my iPhone 6 Plus might run at 600MHz at its worst? I think the fuck not. 

Hell, this whole commotion started when a Redditor said that replacing their battery caused noticeable speed improvements which says something about Apple‚Äôs ‚Äútransparency‚Äù.
Do it. It‚Äôs only $1 and you can personally check how your benchmark scores decrease overtime as your iOS device‚Äôs battery wears. 

Alternatively, you can use a free app called CPU DasherX to check your device‚Äôs current CPU frequency/clock speed. 
If you have a worn battery, the device‚Äôs original CPU frequency does indeed restore to its original state after a battery replacement. However, you will be stuck with a throttled device until then.
‚Äú‚Ä¶ the older *your battery* gets‚Äù is a more accurate claim since the CPU frequency restores to its original state once you get a new battery. Otherwise, you‚Äôre fucked with a throttled device until a battery replacement.

Alternatively, use the ~~free~~ CPU DasherX app to find out your current iPad‚Äôs CPU frequency. 

EDIT: I just looked it up through Google search results and it now says the app costs $1. The app developers probably did this during this whole commotion, unfortunately. 
I have an iPhone 6 Plus myself with a worn battery. I provided [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/7inu45/psa_iphone_slow_try_replacing_your_battery/dr0navh/) as my speculation almost a fortnight ago regarding the matter before Apple provided their official statement.

___

My CPU frequency alternates like the ones you listed above, but also at other frequencies such as [777MHz](https://imgur.com/a/FLD2x). The reason for this is after all, iOS *dynamically* [adjusts clock speeds based on **both** battery wear **and** current battery level.](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/7inu45/psa_iphone_slow_try_replacing_your_battery/dr0z4se/) 

[Something that some people seem to miss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7knibv/lets_clarify_something_with_the_battery_wear/)

___

Now over the week, Apple spoke about how "Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when they have a low battery charge or as they age over time".

What they didn't specify though is *how* this specifically happens. Which is something we're attempting to figuring out right now. I personally don't think it's a coincidence that a lot of iPhones last year experienced sudden shutdown issues. Especially considering that most of the iPhone 6/Plus were 2 years old at the time and the iPhones 6s/Plus only turned 1.

This could be down to a couple of factors:

1. Apple shipped defective batteries.
2. Apple removed/blocked access to certain battery API's in iOS 10. Perhaps this thing could have been a software bug all along?
3. Apple has been pushing past the limits of silicon for the past couple of years. Battery technology isn't there yet so they have to resort to "fixes" like this.

For #1, I think Apple may have possibly shipped defective batteries beyond the iPhone 6s. They just chose not to expand the replacement program and they simply released an update that throttled devices and called it a day.

For #2, it makes me wonder if this issue would still ensue if our phones run on iOS 9. Too bad Apple doesn't allow downgrading even for troubleshooting purposes.

For #3, it's no secret that Apple is leading when it comes to single core performance. However, at what cost? Drawing substantial peaks that can cause a battery to wear and have the device experience sudden shutdown issues **if** it is not throttled?

Apple may have provided their statement about the matter, however, I feel like they still lack some transparency as to what is causing this situation in the whole place.

Yes, they acknowledged that batteries degrade overtime. And they resort to throttling the CPU to compensate for worn batteries, however, what caused this issue to happen in the first place?

Why is my iPhone 3Gs from 2009, which obviously has a much more worn battery, still running at its full and initial clock speed up to this day. Most importantly, why does it not experience sudden shutdown issues if the battery is so worn and the clock speed has never been throttled?

How did you get to convince them to replace your device?
I feel like the home indicator is too small of a touch target to have double tap functions on it. It‚Äôs better off as a grabber for doing gestures. 
Ah, you didn‚Äôt specify which iPod. 

Perhaps something else may be wrong or simply the replacement battery was not OEM? Either way, you can use CPU DasherX to determine your iOS devices‚Äô current CPU frequency. 
Unless you‚Äôre out of the warranty period, of course. Apple Authorized Service Providers work with Apple Stores in a specified region and they honor the standard one year warranty of the device/accessory. 
If you are so bothered by this, simply return them now if you‚Äôre still within the return period and wait for the future if Apple will sell the wireless charging case included with the AirPods. 
Unfortunately for some people like me, premium customer service isn‚Äôt something I experience yet. 

We don‚Äôt have Apple Stores here and any issue like this would need assistance from Apple Authorized Service Providers and the whole process takes 3-4 weeks. 
The [AirPods product page](https://www.apple.com/airpods/) shows that the wireless charging case is an optional accessory coming in 2018. 
This is something I fear that might happen to me after I just dropped $1000 on a premium device. 
Was your replacement battery an OEM?

Also, do you mind checking your CPU frequency using an app called CPU DasherX?
This is an entirely different issue. 

Your dad‚Äôs iPod doesn‚Äôt even run iOS. Let alone does it run iOS 10.2.1 specifically that introduced this dynamic throttling behavior. 

There have been numerous anecdotes stating that a new battery will indeed return the devices‚Äô CPU frequency back to its original state once you replace the battery. Hell, this whole commotion started when a Redditor posted that PSA almost a fortnight ago. 
I can honestly say that the X is indeed sexy and I‚Äôm lusting over it. 

However, the longetivity of the OLED screen is what got me concerned. Only time will tell how the X‚Äôs screen will fare against degradation and burn in and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm really concerned considering I plan to keep my phones more than a few years. 
Yes. It started in iOS 10.2.1. My point is my phone from 2009, despite obviously having a worn battery, still operates in its advertised clock speed as opposed to my iPhone 6 Plus that is synthetically throttled due to a worn battery. 

And this synthetic throttling is bound to come to future iOS devices. 
I‚Äôm quite surprised they even spoke about their plans to expand the ‚Äúfeature‚Äù into future devices.

Right now, I have an iPhone 6 Plus with a worn battery that has its performance throttled and still experiences the shutdown issue. 

My iPhone 3Gs that‚Äôs from 2009 however, obviously has a worn battery, is free fom all this issue **and** it still runs at full speed at 600mhz like it did on day one. 

Apple basically admitted that their newer devices are bound to run slower than their advertised speeds overtime until you replace the battery, which again is not something my iPhone 3Gs experiences despite having a worn battery. 
So basically that. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that a lot of iPhone 6/Plus, and 6s/Plus devices just randomly started having shutdown issues last year. 

Apple basically introduced this ‚Äúfix‚Äù as a bandaid instead of introducing a battery replacement program that‚Äôs beyond the iPhone 6s. Of course, a degraded battery **can cause** these shutdowns regardless weather it‚Äôs worn or not. 

However, I have an iPhone 3GS which obviously has a worn battery, but it still runs at its full speed at 600mhz like it did almost a decade ago. Now we have iPhones which are running the same speed as it if you have a worn battery. 

Also, now that Apple spoke about expanding this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù into their future products, I‚Äôd be wary about updating my future iOS devices. 
According to the Accidental Tech Podscast a few episodes ago, it actually serves a purpose. It‚Äôs to put contents into a much more reachable level for one handed operation. 

It‚Äôs also basically the design language now, and I don‚Äôt mind it since the old, minuature header returns once you scroll. 
The thing is though, the issue is not exclusive to the iPhone 6s. 

I own an iPhone 6 Plus and I experience the unexpected shutdown issue. I also have an almost decade-old iPhone 3GS which obviously has a degraded battery, however it doesn‚Äôt shutdown unexpectedly. 
This feature is long overdue. 
Was your replacement a cheap counterfeit one? If so, it may have contributed as to why you didn‚Äôt have an improvement in terms of performance. 
I would probably be fired before I find my office there. 
Generally speaking, yes. A new battery should restore the CPU frequency to its original state. 

However, it should be noted that counterfeit batteries would be detected accordingly and may not benefit from this throttle-free state. 
It won‚Äôt matter because you can clearly see via CPU DasherX that the CPU frequency never returns to its original value as long as you have a worn battery. The iPhone 6s‚Äôs is originally at 1.8 Ghz in this case. 
I think you missed that the quote I posted here came from the article above. 
Well in the Geekbench article, it said that Apple added a similar throttling in iOS 11.2 that affects the iPhone 7. 

This is basically forced obsolescence and I would definitely be wary about updating in the future. 
I believe Samsung has done this in the past, but they were ultimately caught doing it. 
How about instead of enforcing a synthetic throttling, Apple ultimately admit that it‚Äôs not just the iPhone 6s devices which have a faulty battery which led to these sudden shutdowns in the first place?
> However, does the same issue affect the iPhone 7? 

>>Apple appears to have added a similar change to iOS 11.2.0 for the iPhone 7.

Well this is new. 

What‚Äôs next? Apple also throttles the performance of the iPhones 8 and X in next year‚Äôs iOS 12.2.0?
I remember back in iOS 6 on my iPad mini, Siri wasn‚Äôt full screen, it was simply a pop-up. However, it still required Siri to be in the foreground, so tapping outside of the pop-up Siri window would still dismiss it. 

Might be a great idea if Apple implements how Siri is on the Mac to iOS. 
Since I am now equipped with this knowledge, I would definitely be wary about a used device‚Äôs battery health. I think it would be wise to also replace the used device‚Äôs battery to a new one when purchasing a used phone considering this throttling is forced with no way to disable it. 
Fuck yes. 

It‚Äôs about time they acknowledge this issue themselves. I don‚Äôt care about the impending backlash, they basically forced this update on us without even specifically addressing how they ‚Äúfixed‚Äù the issue in the first place and then just swept this whole thing under the rug. 
I have an iPhone 6 Plus and I have a worn battery. I have a throttled device, too.

[ I made a comment about it a few days ago](http://reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/7inu45/psa_iphone_slow_try_replacing_your_battery/dr0navh) and simply, iOS 10.2.1 was released last year as a ‚Äúfix‚Äù for the sudden shutdown issues that a lot of devices were experiening. The shutdown issues aren‚Äôt exclusive to the iPhone 6s. There were reports that the 6s Plus, 6 and 6 Plus were experiencing it, too. I was experiencing it myself. 

Basically, what Apple did in iOS 10.2.1 is to throttle a device depending on its current battery wear level and current battery percentage. 
iOS 10.2.1*

I hope major publications would pick up and report about this, tbh. 
You can check how fast or how slow your CPU is being crippled at by downloading CPU DasherX from the App Store. 
Do note that the device‚Äôs current battery level is a facor into the system throttling. 

If your device is lower on power, the more aggressive the throttling will be as opposed to a device with a full charge. 
This is my daily life as an iPhone 6 Plus user. 
> (although I don‚Äôt really have any issues with the macOS version)

I envy you. Every once in a while, my iTunes will hang while streaming music and there is no way to make it responsive again. I have to force quit and relaunch it. 
Also, the second-generation performance controller! This is what piqued my curiosity the most. 
Did they officially announce this and offer an explanation why? Such a shame if so because I‚Äôve been holding my breath for a review of the new iPhones, specifically awaiting a review of the A11 Bionic chip alone. 
Why not get both?

Get the AirPods because they‚Äôre seriously worth it and you deserve to treat yourself and have your broken EarPods replaced. 
Marketing dictated timeframe releases are to blame. Unfortunately, unless a major overhaul happens internally, I think the wisest solution for us customers is to delay updating until the major bug slowdowns are worked out. 
This is more likely it as iOS 11.3 is scheduled to debut in beta in January if previous iOS release patterns are to be followed. 
Remember iOS 4.2.5?
Use Imgur.com or the official Reddit app. 
Oh yeah right. My mistake. I meant this isn‚Äôt the first time Apple skipped **version** numbers. 
Thanks!

I do hope it‚Äôs a bug, though. It seems superfluous and just reduces the viewable screen area for smaller devices. 
Can you share a screenshot?
It‚Äôs not the first time Apple skipped a few ~~build~~ version numbers, though. 

In 2011, this happened with iOS 4.2.5. 

Also, iOS 4.2 was never released publicly despite being seeded for developer testing; it was replaced by iOS 4.2.1. 

edit: build -> version
Also wondering why this is a full install instead of a delta update. 
Well this is odd. This is also the first time in a while we saw an X.X.5 update. 
Settings > General > Accessibility > Increase Contrast > then turn of ‚ÄúReduce Transparency‚Äù
Any update?
> Also like the way that when you plugged in the headphones it used to wake the screen. 

This was my favorite feature in iOS 9. 

It stopped working for me in iOS 10, I presume it was intentional with Apple‚Äôs purpose of pushing a wireless future. 
Personally, QuietScrob is a hit or miss for me. Sometimes, it doesn‚Äôt even scrobble at all. I‚Äôve lost countless scrobbles before. I do use a different app however, called Eavescrob. It‚Äôs not as perfect but it‚Äôs significantly better than QuietScrob. 
Why are you so pressed?
Yes. This is exactly what I stated in my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/7inu45/psa_iphone_slow_try_replacing_your_battery/dr0navh/). The thread blew up so hopefully more people could be aware of  what‚Äôs going on. 

What‚Äôs weird is that I can‚Äôt find any article on the web about this. I only found out when another redditor shared this theory, but when put together, makes a very convincing anecdote. Hopefully it blows up more that it captures the attention of bloggers who could do some investigation regarding this commotion. 
It was 10.2.1 that was released to alleviate the shutdown issues last year. 

Anything below it such as 10.2.0 should be unaffected. 
From personal experience, the system just feels slow. Even more so if my device is currently at less than 50% of charge. This is when my device stutters a lot even at the most basic tasks like opening/closing apps, evoking Reachability, etc. 
Yes, it‚Äôs still in iOS 11. 
I think you missed the most important parts of my comments above. 

I stated that I have a worn battery and iOS now dynamically adjusts system performance based on battery wear and current battery level, hence my low benchmark scores.
To check my current battery health, I use coconutBattery on my Mac. 

To check the current frequency my CPU is operating in/to see how much iOS throttles it, I use an app called ‚ÄúCPU DasherX‚Äù on my phone. 
I didn‚Äôt know about this. Thanks!

I was only hesitant to bring it up for a repair because I thought it would require a home button replacement and that would render Touch ID useless if done via third party. 
Actually I‚Äôve easily consumed 500 full charge cycles within 1 year of owning my phone. 

What I‚Äôm saying is that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that my phone, in addition to a bunch of others, suddenly started experiencing random shutdowns just last year. 

It‚Äôs also worth noting however that in iOS 10, Apple blocked certain battery APIs, which may possibly have caused this issue to some extent. 
May I ask what's wrong with your home button?

I have a 6 Plus myself but the home button is very recessed, but it still works.
Personally, I'm convinced they throttle based on battery wear level **and** current battery percentage.

I have an iPhone 6 Plus myself that has a worn battery. I use an app called ‚ÄúCPU Dasher X‚Äù to determine how throttled my device is currently. 

___

When fully charged, [this is how my phone scores in Geekbench 4.](https://i.imgur.com/HKEMknj.png) and [here it is when my current battery percentage is low, like <50%](https://i.imgur.com/J6XA9PP.png) Take note I never use Low Power Mode. Also when at a low battery level, my phone stutters heavily at the most mundane tasks such as opening/closing an app, evoking Reachability, etc.

I‚Äôm hoping this issue picks up some traction that leads major publications investigating about this. Hopefully, they can do further studies than the anecdotal reference that everyone who‚Äôs aware about this is presenting now. 
I‚Äôve had my iPhone 6 Plus since February 2015 so it‚Äôs pretty much out of warranty now. 

I actually had a preliminary appointment with an Apple Authorized Service Provider (AASP) earlier this year. They didn‚Äôt take my phone apart, but I just spoke to them about the battery and recessed home button issues. They also entertained the possibility that I *might* have a ballooning battery so they might get me a replacement for free regardless of age since that‚Äôs considered a safety hazard. 

I just can‚Äôt afford to lose access to my smartphone for almost a month because it‚Äôs vital for school & work. I think I‚Äôll just purhase a 7 Plus or an 8 Plus next year, idk. üò©
Makes me wonder how well the new iPhones‚Äô glass back will fare for these type of people. 
Honestly, this is one of those things I wish Apple acknowledged instead of sweeping under the rug. This isn‚Äôt something that customers should have to find out for themselves.

iOS 10.2.1 was released last year, as a ‚Äúfix‚Äù for the sudden shutdown issues that a lot of devices were experiencing. Apple did this so by dynamically adjusting iOS system performance based on battery wear. 

Someone had a theory here that Apple did this because they were aware that there were a lot of faulty batteries that needs replacing, but instead of coming clean, they released iOS 10.2.1 which throttles our devices instead. 

I‚Äôm kind of glad Geekbench became free in the past few weeks leading to more people discovering this issue. 
I don‚Äôt have an Apple Store where I live, too!

I‚Äôm really hoping to have my battery replaced by a third party repair shop, however, I also have a recessed home button that I wish to be repaired in the future. And I know that Apple doesn‚Äôt entertain devices with third party replacements anymore and that sucks for us customers. Especially those living in places without Apple Stores. 

I‚Äôm really frustrated with how my iPhone 6 Plus has aged. 
Does Apple still offer battery replacement for your machine? My sister has an even older Air (2010) and I just assumed it‚Äôs 2GB RAM is the reason its slow. Maybe the degrading battery is also a factor. 
Had mine since February 2015. 
I have an iPhone 6 Plus and this issue is definitely beyond the iPhone 6s. 

iOS 10.2.1 was supposed to fix the sudden shutdown issue, but it never did for me and I experience the same things as you on your 6s Plus. 
Can you run the tip of your finger through the scratches. Does your finger get stuck in one of them? If not, they‚Äôre most likely just scratches on the oleophobic coating. 
At it‚Äôs current state, I don‚Äôt have high hopes for an upcoming product if it has to rely on Siri. 
You mentioned CPU Dasher X and your battery health, so you must be aware that iOS dynamically adjusts system performance based on battery wear. 

The fact that this happens to you despite having a healty battery quite puzzles me. 
> üí° BRIGHT SIDE


sprinkling this thread all over my fries
What a nice way to talk to someone by immediately sounding condescending and generalizing. You‚Äôd be surprised to know that a number of people, prefer to *and* actually love using their phone caseless. 
I don‚Äôt think I can ever use the X or 8 Plus caseless ever since the glass back basically requires a new phone replacement if ever it‚Äôs damaged. Which is why I‚Äôm torn between the 7 Plus or 8 Plus. 
This is ons of those rare times where I see someone they preferred the iPhone 6‚Äôs design over the iPhone 5‚Äôs. 
Were looking at multi-core scores here. For simple iOS tasks, noticeable speed differences should be dictated by the single-core scores which should be a more accurate way of interpreting performance between devices on simple iOS tasks. 

Also, the iPhones 8/Plus/X‚Äôs A11 Bionic chip has the ability to harness all its cores which lead to the almost double multi-core score we see above. 
If anything, the major improvement in the Apple A8 chips is reduced power consumption. The Anandtech review for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus was quite an interesting read back then. 
Ugh. I swear iOS 9 made restoring a hassle with app thinning. iOS 11 even makes the thought of restoring/starting over completely tedious because not even iTunes apps can be used anymore to back up apps unless you use a special version of iTunes. 

Customers should never have to deal with this in the first place. 
> I read somewhere that it‚Äôs to move content down so that it‚Äôs reachable for one-handed use. Note than upon scrolling a little, the old little heading reappears.

This is pretty interesting. Do you still have a source? Seems like a good read and I‚Äôd love to learn more about their analysis. 
Skipping songs in iTunes for my Mac has been very apparent for a while now. 
May I ask why?
Makes me wonder what is the common factor for those of us having problems as opposed to you guys who does seem to enjoy iOS 11 perfectly fine. 
I remember watching a speed test pitting Face ID & Touch ID here, in one, the user was unlocking the device from their pocket. Obviously, Touch ID won because the user‚Äôs finger was already on the Home button. 

In another video though, in-app authentications/Safari passcode authentication is what truly amazed me. It was truly game-changing and I was amused at how I missed that you wouldn‚Äôt have to do anything for those tasks other than watch the cute Face ID auth. 
I believe it‚Äôs an effort to control demand. That‚Äôs why Apple only sells unlocked devices when the supplies have improved. 
> what's the point in glass?

Wireless charging. Premium feel at the expense of durability. 
How was that biased when Apple worked closely with them last year to address a Safari bug impacting battery life?
I remember there was an app on sale in the App Store that easily provides you the ability to do this. 

I just forgot the name of the app. 
I thought the whole point of this is that it shouldn‚Äôt disrupt your workflow by taking you to the App Store. All of that disappears the moment it takes you there. 
There‚Äôs finally emoji for people with red hair im crying
Wow. I don‚Äôt think an app I use have this. Also, I think this could be improved by having a dialog box for a comment/suggestions. 
I believe the issue is tied to AssistiveTouch. I also experience the bug even on the final release of iOS 11.2. 

To fix the issue, simply click the AssistiveTouch button, then simply double tap the Home virtual button twice. 
What app was used for this?
Just wondering how long have you had your 6 Plus and how is your battery wear?
> Federighi has made a good replacement to Forstall. So everything worked out in the end.

Debatable. iOS quality has went downhill since iOS 7. This was the first major release that launched without Scott. 
I was a beta tester during the iOS 11.2 development period and it was removed since Beta 1. It never made a comeback. 

I also reported it in the Feedback app, but I never received a response. 

The best we can do for now is to sumbit feedback in: apple.com/feedback. 
Doesn‚Äôt Face ID requires 2 scans of your face initially when setting it up? 

Maybe you can re-enroll your face then not use your glasses on the second scan enrollment. 
Long pressing/3D Touching to bring up the context menu in the Now Playing bar is now gone, which I found really useful. 
> are only available on devices with wide color gamut (iPhone 7 and later)
I will never understand why Apple withholds wallpapers from other devices. More so their beautiful promotional campaign wallpapers for older devices from the previous years. 
You may call the Apple Store and schedule a diagnostic. The system may be a having a kernel panic, which may be a stretch, but is still a possibility if the hardware is failing. 

Make sure you bring your other 7 Plus for demo purposes. 
That would probably require too much GPU power which would impact battery life. 
I inquired because I‚Äôm certain Apple Music is a culprit for the ever growing System storage. 

If you compare [Settings > About](https://i.imgur.com/KZaBc3z.jpg) with [Settings > Music > Downloaded Music](https://i.imgur.com/tXELM9l.jpg), you‚Äôll see different available storage capacities listed in these locations. 

[For reference, here is my current System storage on 11.2 Final.](https://i.imgur.com/Tiumq8U.jpg)
Just wondering, do you happen to have Apple Music?
Fuck yes.

I own an iPhone 6 Plus that originally shipped with iOS 8.1 and it was the buggiest experiences I ever had for a flagship smartphone at the time. 
It‚Äôs possible as long as your AirPods are currently connected to your Mac and at least one AirPod is inside the case. 
It‚Äôs been like this since the App Switcher was last redesigned in iOS 9. 
> Customers aren‚Äôt gonna leave.

They aren‚Äôt, but that wouldn‚Äôt stop them and publications from publishing articles such as ‚ÄúApple Can‚Äôt Innovate Anymore‚Äù. 

Also, marketing timeframe dictated releases are ultimately to blame for the software instability we see at this point. 


> iOS on iPad has a long way to go in terms of being on par with macOS

I feel like a lot of people would be satisfied if iOS simply gained a native, local file manager and Xcode support.  
Not necessarily based on the size. Previous betas have been full installs rather than delta ones. Not to mention if you skip a beta, the next download you‚Äôre going to get is also a full package. 

But for 11.2 Beta 6, the build number could be an indicator that this might be the GM. 
The last screenshot is very r/SiriFail. 
There is neither a time limit, nor a setting. The music won‚Äôt auto-resume unless you put it back on your ears or ‚Äútrick‚Äù the two infrared sensors in the AirPod by covering them. 
Comments like these are quite confusing because iOS 10 particularly began utilizing 3D Touch more, specifically the notification system. 
Not on an iPad but yesterday and today, some photos I saw have been extremely low quality. Seems like it‚Äôs an app or a back end issue. 
Not to mention, when you‚Äôre looking at your account settings, then accidentally tap ‚ÄúChoose Artists for You‚Äù you‚Äôll be taken to the bubble artist selection screen and all your previous suggestions will be reset. 

Kind of a pain in the ass to do all those again. 
I may be wrong, but the feature you‚Äôre talking about is called Handoff. 

Handoff is a feature introduced in iOS 8 back in 2014 that enables you to start a task on one device and continue it on another as long as you‚Äôre signed into the same iCloud account and your devices have Bluetooth + WiFi on, and in a reasonable distance between each other. 

It also shows Google Chrome because you have probably set it as the default browser on your Mac. 

By default, Google Chrome can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù what you‚Äôre browsing on the Mac unless you explicitly bring your phone near to your Mac, click the Google Chrome icon from the dock, and then it will open the link currently open on your iPhone. 
I find it amusing he critiqued the iPhone 7 as ‚Äúa disconnected component housed in an enclosure‚Äù considering that‚Äôs almost a criticism and the product is still for sale, and also, they went away with a unibody enclosure which is something I thought Ive wanted. 
Have you seen [u/noctngu‚Äôs comment?](http://reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/7gja1f/bug_suddenly_cant_swipe_left_or_right_to_access/dqjr8pf) Do you have AssistiveTouch enabled?
Thank you for this! However, I have been trying to reproduce the issue using the steps you mentioned for 20 minutes now and I can‚Äôt make it work. 

I do think the issue is indeed tied to AssistiveTouch which could make sense why it isn‚Äôt widely described here since a lot of people dislike the look of the floating button. Also back in iOS 9, I remember being able to disable every system animation and AssistiveTouch was also the culprit. 

For now, I‚Äôll keep your solution in mind‚Äîin addition to the one I mentioned in the OP‚Äîwhen I encounter the bug again. 
Most definitely with the Stage Light Portrait Lightning effect. 
I was on beta 4 the other day and my Music app suddenly stopped responding and it crashed. When I launched it again, it seemed to have lost my 30GB worth of download content and have cleared my cache. 

This is the first time this happened to me in iOS 11, though. I remember a sinilar scenario happening way back when I was with iOS 9, so it might have been a stability bug that carried over or is simply a regression. 

I‚Äôm on 11.2 Beta 5 now and slowly re-downloading all my offline data, hopefully this won‚Äôt happen again. 
You can double tap to zoom on videos in the native iOS media player? I also never had problems that accidentally causes video playback to fast forward or rewind in the YouTube app, but I see your point. 
Not only that, I actually wish Apple would just implement the double tap feature, too. Seems way better and easier than having to resort to tapping the small touch targets at the bottom of the screen. 
Cover sheet unlock animation seems smoother for me at least on a 6 Plus. 

Edit: ok it still stutters, but it‚Äôs generally smoother than before. 
> simply because of how fragile the glass back feels

I‚Äôm wondering, do you plan on investing on a case in the future? Or even a tempered glass back protector?
Uh oh. This is like one of those OIS issues that plagued some iPhone 6 Plus back in the day. It might be worth arranging a replacement. 
Oh so does this mean you don‚Äôt have access to the iPhone 6 anymore?

Can you go to the Settings app, then scroll to Photos. Do you happen to have ‚ÄúOptimize iPhone Storage‚Äù selected? 

It may also seem like your phone is still downloading these photos since you restored from a backup. 
1) Did you restore from a back up or did you setup as new?

2) If you did restore, did you do it via a computer?

Seriously, I think OP should. I just cringed at the possibility of meeting your cracked $1000 phone for the first time. 
I‚Äôm always surprised whenever I see someone who‚Äôs got some positive reception with iOS 11. 

If anything, this just proves performance is a mixed bag or there are really some lucky ones. 
Should we also rename r/AirPods as r/LookAtMyNewAirPods?
I‚Äôm not sure you understood what I meant. 

If you scroll in Settings > Cellular Data, frame drops will ensue, the scrolling experience is not 60fps smooth. 
> no stuttering

Until you scroll in the list of apps in Settings > Cellular Data‚Ä¶
Do you use mobile data or Wi-Fi?

I personally use a pocket Wi-Fi and this is the only time I have the issue happen on my phone. If I connect to another Wi-Fi, the issue doesn‚Äôt persist. 

edit: On my Mac, however it tends to skip regardless where I‚Äôm connected to. 
People need to stop with the rice thing because you‚Äôre doing much more irreparable damage because tiny particles may get in the device which could ultimately lead to its death. 

That said, if you [look at the AirPods teardown,](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/AirPods+Teardown/75578) you‚Äôll see gobs of glue which should at least repel water from damaging the insides. 

I‚Äôd let the AirPods dry in open air and leave them for a day. If they don‚Äôt work, try getting them replaced, luckily they don‚Äôt have a water damage indicator, so you **might** just get a new one free of charge. 
They look nice, however I just wish the experience isn‚Äôt so stuttery.
I should have clarified. I‚Äôm aware, that‚Äôs why I said *I hope it will be fixed.*
I noticed this happens on mine, too, but it‚Äôs so rare and I can‚Äôt figure a way to successfully reproduce it. A reboot fixes this, though. 
It was added way back in iOS 10.2.1 as a ‚Äúfix‚Äù for the sudden shutdown issue saga that iOS devices were experiencing last year. 

It seems shady that Apple knew there‚Äôs something wrong with a lot of batteries, but instead they issued a ‚Äúfix‚Äù that throttles system performance rather than publicly announcing a replacement program [which isn‚Äôt exclusive to a single iPhone model.](https://www.apple.com/support/iphone6s-unexpectedshutdown/)
Oh wow this is surprising. I‚Äôm on a 6 Plus myself, and I think it‚Äôs weird how one of the currently most powerful smartphones on the market can‚Äôt achieve consistent 60fps scrolling. Hopefully this gets fixed soon. 
What about Metal 2? Can you enlighten me about that? Is this just like the WindowServer on High Sierra now running on Metal?
Honestly, battery is the only thing to worry about‚Ä¶ or not. It‚Äôs inevitable that it will degrade, regardless of how you use it, but they are designed to at least hold on to a certain amount of charge cycles before ultimately needing to be replaced. 
> At the end of the day those numbers don‚Äôt show true real world usage performance. 

In a certain case, they actually do. More people haven‚Äôt been aware that iOS now dynamically scales system performance when you have a worn battery. 

Just a few days ago, there was someone wondering why their phone have a low Geekbench score and explicitly stated that their device gets extremely slow and laggy further when it hits a low battery level. 
Another possibility to keep in mind is that there‚Äôs dirt inside the case that prevents the AirPods from keeping contact with the charging pins of the case. That‚Äôs what happened to me before. A simple blow inside the case should alleviate the issue. 
It‚Äôs a worn battery. Consider to check it and have it replaced. 
I think I got a coupon code or promotional stuff before. I don‚Äôt remember paying for this as well. 
It‚Äôs even more helpful now that iOS dynamically adjusts device performance when you have a worn battery. 
~~3D Touching the left edge of the screen to access the App Switcher is also available on the iPhone X running iOS 11.1 or newer.~~

edit: Whoops. Looks like the 3D Touch on the left edge of the screen was *never* available on the iPhone X because you can swipe left or right directly on the home bar at the bottom of the phone to quickly switch apps. 

I got them mixed up with the news that iOS 11.1 brought back the 3D Touch left edge gesture with the other phones. 

Apologies for any confusion. 
I have the same problem as u/mezdupyatok, but I don‚Äôt have an old cable. It‚Äôs the original cable that came with my AirPods that I only started to use a few months ago. 

I do have a [cable protector similar to this](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1klKdQpXXXXXTaXXXq6xXFXXXl/Usb-Cable-Spring-Protective-Sleeve-Earphone-Spiral-Cord-Protector-For-iPhone-Earphone-and-Charging-Cable-100pcs.jpg) wrapped around it, however. What‚Äôs weird is that if I connect my AirPods, an iPad mini on iOS 9, or an iPhone 5 on iOS 10 to my Mac, the problem doesn‚Äôt persist. 

I tried to connect my iPhone using another Anker cable and it seemed to work fine, however. 

Unless Apple added a cable-protecting sensor in iOS 11.2, something is wrong here considering if I connect other devices, they seem to be fine. 
I think it‚Äôs partly because I‚Äôm a righty and I tend to type fast one handed using my right thumb. 

I‚Äôve bever typed fast using my left thumb, however. And the left hand only gets to grip my phone when my right hand is tired. 
> Not sure what the equivalent on the 3-press is on the iPhone X, though.

I think I read somewhere you can triple press the side button on the iPhone X. 

Either way, iOS 11 has an option to add these accessibility shortcuts in the Control Center. 
There are times where I start playing music on my Mac where I wish I can immediately continue on my phone when I leave. 

Also, the ability to control music playback and volume from another iOS device would be a great addition to Apple Music. 
Was your replacement battery an OEM? 

I have a worn battery, too, and the random shutdown issue was never fixed for me. I‚Äôve known for a while now that iOS,‚Äîsince 10.2.1‚Äîdynamically adjusts system performance for devices with worn batteries. 

I‚Äôm debating if it‚Äôs still worth to replace my 6 Plus‚Äôs batter or if I should just upgrade to a 7 Plus since I already have the cash for it. 
This looks really good! If you have an Instagram upload this with a hashtag #ShotOniPhone and Apple may just find this and feature you ona photo campaign!
I see you say you almost always have yours in your ears. So I guess it‚Äôs safe to assume you use them around a >5 hour mark? If so, do the batteries on yours last long?

I‚Äôm asking because my left AirPod lasts only 2.5-3.5 hours and my right one at 3-4.5 hours. But to be fair, I‚Äôve had them since January and use them a lot so this may be normal battery wear. 
Wasn‚Äôt he responsible for the development of Apple Pay?
Glad it's smooth on the X!

However, the Plus models downscale everything on the screen in realtime unlike the X.
Yeah sounds like they have a worn battery to be precise. Ever since the random shutdowns incident with iPhones and iOS 10 saga last year, iOS now dynamically adjusts system performance to prevent sudden spikes in general usage. 

u/dougreed1981 if you have a Mac, you can use cococnutBattery to check your current wear level, then on your iOS device, download an app called ‚ÄúCPU DasherX‚Äù and check your CPU frequency difference [when your phone is charged fully](https://i.imgur.com/CFS0pfG.jpg) vs [when it‚Äôs low on power.](https://i.imgur.com/z5Zcpjv.jpg)
This has got me concerned because I‚Äôm hoping to upgrade to a 7 Plus myself coming from a 6 Plus. 

I wonder if the 8 Plus is experiencing this as well. 
Reddit updated its site-wide policy to prohibit content that ‚Äúencourages, glorifies, incites or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or group of people‚Äù.
Unrelated, but this is one of those times where I miss the App Store Wish List. 
It‚Äôs a feature in iOS 11. In case you missed it, when you wake up your phone, the dark part in the wallpaper illuminates first, then follows the light areas. 
Well I mean, every 4 years, there seems to be a major revision to the MacBook Pro line, right?

2008: alumin(i)um unibody design 

2012: Retina Display, thinner chassis

2016: Touch Bar, USB-C, thinner chassis once again
I wouldn‚Äôt call any place other than the App Store to install apps ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù  
To be fair, back when the Gold iPhone 5s was severely constrained, Apple Store managers were even encouraging customers to order the Space Grey color instead then return it in the 2 week period. 
You can try replacing them forever and you‚Äôll never end up with a 100% perfect, seamless AirPods. 

They have never been seamless because they‚Äôre not constructed from a single piece and this has always been the case even since the introduction of EarPods back in 2012. 

You can always ask to have them replaced if the seam appears to be sharp to contribute to any major discomfort, otherwise you‚Äôll just be wasting your time nitpicking over this. 
*should have
This is something I observed that happens when one of two things happen:

1. The album is from a compilation, and the song is not available in that compilation for streaming, but the song is available for streaming *from a different album.*

2. The album from which the song is originally from suddenly becomes unavailable on Apple Music, but the song is still available from another album or some random DJ‚Äôs playlist. Apple Music then replaces the song with one of which sources it‚Äôs still available from. 

I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a way to prevent this from happening since this is a default behavior. What you can do though, is to manually manage or edit the songs metadata using iTunes on your Mac or PC. 
Unrelated, but I‚Äôm wondering why it says the app version for you right below the app‚Äôs name, [when on mine it just says the day the update was made available.](https://i.imgur.com/prHIFUd.jpg)
Not always, though. There were no A4X and A7X chips. 
Wallpaper?
It‚Äôs included in iOS 11. 
The 6 has significantly less pixels than the 6 Plus though. In addition to this, unoptimization in the 6 Plus and contents on the display are downsampled in real time are contributing factors to poor animations. 
‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs very stuttery! On a 6 Plus, at least. 
I miss this wallpaper. 
About 150.5mb on a 6 Plus. Wonder why it‚Äôs significantly smaller. 
11.1 Beta 4 for me. And then came 11.1 Beta 5 which was something about a 32mb update that ruined things again. 
I wish the iPhones 8 and X had easy to remove back panels. If they did, I would immediately jump ship from my aging 6 Plus. 
[Well this is the landscape keyboard prior iOS 11 on the 4.7‚Äù (at the top of the photo) and 5.5‚Äù (on the bottom) models respectively. 
](https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2014/09/keyboard-extensions-100437668-large.jpg)

[Now in iOS 11, all devices, regardless of screen size have this landscape keyboard instead. ](https://forums.macrumors.com/attachments/img_0146-jpg.711319/) So much wasted space especially on the Plus models and the Dictation icon placement in the bottom right corner is just annoying. 
It‚Äôs a thing in every Bluetooth headphones. 
It‚Äôs likely the sender still hasn‚Äôt updated to iOS 11.1.1. 
If I have to guess it‚Äôs for feature parity because the iPhone X has a permanent flashlight button in the lower left corner and a camera shortcut at the lower right. 

Also, the iPhone X is unlocked using a swipe up gesture. And the Handoff feature in the lock screen used to be accessed in a similar swipe up gesture. 

This isn‚Äôt the first thing Apple removed for feature parity, though. Another speculation for this is the removal of the extra keyboard shortcuts on iOS 11 for all iPhones with >4‚Äù screens. 
Not anymore. It‚Äôs now only accessible from the App Switcher UI. 
I just imagined my iPhone 6 Plus crash. 
u/DirtySpriteCup


I used to be just like you guys. Self-conscious when wearing them because they do stand out. However, I‚Äôve had mine for more than 10 months now and honestly can‚Äôt give a single shit how people perceive how they look. 

Perhaps, I may just be lucky because whenever I see someone staring, they‚Äôre usually in awe rather than having that criticizing look on their face. 
> They need to hire more developers then 

If you know a thing or two about software development, you‚Äôll know that software development doesn‚Äôt work that way. 

You‚Äôre even compromising the quality of software by simply hiring people for the sole purpose of having ‚Äúmore‚Äù employees work on iOS. 
Maybe they have dry hands. 
It‚Äôs the Jet Black iPhone 7. 
Which is quite embarrassing because iOS 11.0 had like 11 beta previews? It was the most betas ever for a major iOS release, I believe. 
Did it come will all those accessories? üòÆ
Also, iOS 11.1 makes AssistiveTouch even more helpful by adding new Double Press & Long Press functionalities. 
But the thing is, if Apple hears quite some feedback, they may at least consider or acknowledge it. Even behind their closed doors. 


Just like in iOS 8.1, it brought back the Camera Roll after they removed it in iOS 8.0. Craig Federighi specifically said on stage in the October 2014 Keynote that it‚Äôs because ‚Äúthey heard some feedbacks.‚Äù
Well wasn‚Äôt there a backup modification hack for it that I remember?
Where do we go from here?
That ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù was specifically for bringing back the iconic Camera Roll in iOS 8.1 when they removed it in iOS 8.0. 
Is there a source for this? I‚Äôd like to read more about it. 
What I mean is that the matching will still occur on every track of yours. However, they‚Äôre much more accurate now. 

I remember when I joined Apple Music back in 2015. It messed up my library big time. Changed album artworks, deleted some tracks, replaced studio versions with live versions‚Ä¶ etc. Thankfully, I have a backup of my library. Which is what I suggest you do, too. 
Unfortunately no, notification sounds are tied to the Ringer setting. At least, not in a way I‚Äôm currently aware of. 
Go to Settings > Sounds > and then enable the ‚ÄúChange with Buttons‚Äù setting. 
Apple Music switched from metadata matching to fingerprinting your tracks for about a year already. 

Fingerprint matching your tracks should greatly reduce incorrect matches when you enable iCloud Music Library. 
Just wondering, if you reset your phone via iTunes, then decide to restore it there, it will also restore your messages, right?
You can tell from the double exclamation point they were quite excited to make that statement. 
I‚Äôm not quite sure how to feel about this smaller tap target. 

Also nice to see someone rocking that Dynamic wallpaper. 
Just because it‚Äôs not in this beta doesn‚Äôt mean the feature is dead. Apple has been testing it internally for a while now and it makes sense if you factor in the initial Apple Pay release in 2014 which was announced to come in a later update and that feature wasn‚Äôt available for public beta testing. 
What is this bug?
How‚Äôs the iOS 11 holding up on yours? I‚Äôm on a 6 Plus as well and I can‚Äôt wait to get rid of this phone. 
It‚Äôs pretty much been neglected since Apple introduced 5.5‚Äù smartphones. Receiving only minor updates and the most recent iPad mini update was back in 2015 and is running a processor that was debuted back in 2014. In addition to this, there are also articles online from research analysts suggesting that there might be no more updates to the iPad mini lineup which is a great shame. 
[Like this?](https://youtu.be/ksZh-FHuKpk)
What‚Äôs even bothersome is that iOS 11.0 had like the most beta releases ever in a major update. Where did all those time spent on testing go?
I really wish Apple won‚Äôt retire the 7.9‚Äù iPad mini line. It‚Äôs the absolute perfect size for me and comments like these strengthen the fact that there are still people interested in the small tablet‚Äôs form factor. 
May I ask how your iPhone 6s‚Äôs home button is broken? Was it dropped or simply depressed? I‚Äôm curious myself since I own a 6 Plus, but it‚Äôs depressed home button still works. 
[Apple is acknowledging the issue and a fix is coming in a future software update. ](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/ht208240)
The ‚Äúhome bar‚Äù that‚Äôs seated prominently at the bottom of the iPhone X. 
But I‚Äôm wondering if you‚Äôve tested out the iPhone version of True Tone yet? I‚Äôm asking because I haven‚Äôt and maybe there **may be** a slight difference between the two that you may find noticeable. 
I still really think it‚Äôs quite dumb to remove the betta fishes love wallpapers. Now, every iPhone that isn‚Äôt the X only has 3 Live Wallpapers to choose from. 
Thanks for the response! I‚Äôm not really concerned about scratches, what I‚Äôm afraid of is the inevitable moment I‚Äôll mess up and drop the phone. I‚Äôve been using the slipperiest iPhone to date (6 Plus) for almost 3 years now naked for most of the time since I really loathe cases. I do have a tempered glass, though. Hopefully, a tempered glass for the back of the iPhone X is available. 
Have you always or at least for a brief period, owned your iPhone 4 caseless? If so, are you also going caseless with the iPhone X? Just curious. 
You can download an app called coconutBattery for macOS. 
What device are you on?
Oh man I‚Äôd love to try it out. However, I‚Äôm on limited data and my slow ass internet would take ages to download the iOS firmware, let alone download all my apps back since we can‚Äôt restore apps from iTunes anymore. 

I think I‚Äôll just wait for the next beta. Glad that it works for you, though! üôÇ
It‚Äôs been 2 days aand I can confirm I still get the pop-up even with the tvOS beta installed. Have you found any alternative solutions, though?
I honestly want another moment in tech like this. 
Yes. It‚Äôs the same width to the iPhone 5s and every iPhone before the screens got wider with the introduction of the iPhone 6. 
No. I use narwhal for Reddit and [this is what I see.](https://i.imgur.com/Uokqd46.png)
iOS 11 brings a one-handed keyboard feature that should at least ease this concern. 
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this happens in future iOS releases. 
[This pop-up appears to me literally every time I bring up the cover sheet.](https://i.imgur.com/S4e0sdS.png) I‚Äôve done a hard reset and installed the tvOS beta as a workaround, but the issue persists once again after a while. 
Has there been a tempered glass for the back for the iPhone X already? I really haven't seen one for the iPhone 8 yet, which is quite the only thing holding me back from getting these new devices.
Reachability is a feature that you can trigger by double tapping (not press, just 2 taps) the home button to bring the top part of the screen into a thumb reachable level. This feature is exclusive to iPhones with 4.7‚Äù, 5.5‚Äù, or 5.8‚Äù displays. 

On the iPhone X however, you slide down the ‚Äúhome bar‚Äù due to the removal of the home button. 
I‚Äôm a righty, but I prefer the left Pod on the rare occasion I‚Äôll just use one. For some reason, I always thought the right ear is best for listening to conversations, and the left one is for music listening. 
1. I notice that the ‚ÄúPress home to unlock‚Äù text was slightly moved a little lower. 

7. I‚Äôm on a 6 Plus and the unlock animation stutters or is completely non-existent. The App Switcher is also very stuttery. Something that I never experienced before iOS 11.1 betas. And yes, I have done a reset all settings fix. I‚Äôm not counting on any more improvements for my device for this release after this, though. 

11. I think the camera animation from the lock screen is first found in the iOS 11.1 betas. 
A restart temporarily fixes this for me, but after a while it returns and literally appears every time I bring up the cover sheet. 
But can you 3D Touch on yours?
Not new in 11.2. It‚Äôs been there since 11.1 Beta 4. 
iOS 11.1 beta 2 brings back the ability to swipe down the Cover Sheet on Reachability. 

I would assume on the X, you can simply swipe down as if the right ‚Äúear‚Äù was also brought down to a reachable level. 
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they wouldn‚Äôt get future review units after this. 
I saw someone make a comment either here or on r/apple or on r/iPhone where they basically said the same thing but it was quite due to the sudden shutdowns iOS devices were experiencing last year. iOS 10.2.1 apparently brought this feature to prevent sudden spikes in usage, therefore lowering the risk of a sudden shutdown. 
Yeah I think it‚Äôs superfluous and it‚Äôs just another one in the bucket list of UI inconsistencies in iOS 11. 
For some reason, mine don‚Äôt have any. 
Is there a reason why installing the tvOS beta profile prevents the iOS update prompt from appearing?
Sounds like you have invert colors on. 
Also while we‚Äôre on the context of this, does anyone else not get the context menu when long-pressing the Now Playing bar? I‚Äôm on a 6 Plus, though so no 3D Touch for me. 
Slowly swiping up Now Playing from the bottom of the music app now tracks your finger movement as opposed to before, where it simply opened the Now Playing screen without tracking where your finger is dragging on the screen. 
It‚Äôs quite stuttery on my 6 Plus however, sometimes my screen flashes white when I let go of the Now Playing bar. 
What device do you have? I own a 6 Plus and always assumed it's due to the lack of RAM. Happened to me in earlier versions of iOS 10, too, though.
This is honestly ridiculous. 
Good lord
I own a 6 Plus, one of the older devices, and the unlock animation is either stuttery or completely non-existent at times on 11.1 Beta 5. 
Not really a necessity, but more for a peace of mind. 
May I ask how you would get more reliable results with the Series 3?
Did you ever manage to look for a tempered glass back cover? I‚Äôd love to know what you managed to look for. 
I have a 6 Plus too, and it‚Äôs naked since I got it for 2.5+ years already. The fact that the back is expensive to replace is what hinders me from getting the 8 Plus instead of the 7 Plus. 

It won‚Äôt happen, but I wish Apple offered an aluminum back iPhone 8. I‚Äôd rather have that instead of inductive charging, truthfully. 
I don‚Äôt remember since when this started happening for me. Idk if it might be due to connectivity issues in iOS 11, but the problem is extremely noticeable when using only the left AirPod for me. 
Do you still actively use them? I still have mine, however since I had the AirPods, any other wired earphones I own has seen significantly less usage. 
It‚Äôs one of the cheapest IEMs with custom dual-drivers since it‚Äôs intoduction, actually. 
i looked it up a few years ago and basically the main reason i got is that lawyers are to blame for this one. 
How does one get a hold of this draft? 
I‚Äôve been wanting to own a watch for a while now and the ability to browse my phone‚Äôs library from the watch is one of the major selling points I consider. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure some people have already written to Apple for feedback, but was there any official reason why that feature was removed in watchOS 4? Seems like a major regression with no point other than to promote iCloud Music Library for the watch‚Äîat least that‚Äôs what I think. 
Hhow much did you originally pay for your watch?

Also I‚Äôd be interested to know how the process will go through for you later. 
How was your Jet Black? Did you use it caseless? 
Been there since 11.0 Beta 1. 
I'm aware. However looking at the iPhone's immediate competitors, I'm puzzled why the [Samsung Galaxy S8+ for example weights only 173 grams](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_s8+-8523.php) despite having a larger display, significantly larger battery, and also having a glass back. I may be missing something, though, but I'm genuinely curious as to why this is the case.
I actually won‚Äôt mind it if battery technology advances that it would mean the devices won‚Äôt get thicker/heavier. 

The iPhone 8 Plus for example is already 202 grams despite having the smallest battery size ever in a 5.5‚Äù iPhone. 
Yes. The Accessibility page got a cleanup in Beta 4. 
How‚Äôs the unlock animation for you? I‚Äôm on a 6 Plus too and for me it‚Äôs either stutter-y or the unlock animation doesn‚Äôt happen at all. 

Also, I did a ‚Äúreset all settings‚Äù and it did quite improve performance by a bit for me. However, the general stuttering in the App Switcher and Control Center are still there. Guessing stutters are just a way of life for us 6 Plus users. üò™
Been like this for me since 11.0. The battery widget has been buggy. 

Sometimes, it will only show 2 items for me, therefore I can‚Äôt see the AirPods case charge if I‚Äôm using one AirPod and the other one is in the case charging. 
What connection issues are you specifically having?

I‚Äôm sometimes experiencing weird instances wherein the AirPods would drop out and music will start playing from my phone instead. Also theres this annoying thing where it takes time for them to connect to my phone or sometimes, they literally won‚Äôt. I have to either manually select them in the AirPlay menu or put them back in the case, then take them out *again* because they‚Äôre not available in the aforementioned menu. 
The animation is new in Developer Beta 4. 
Oh. [That‚Äôs actually been fixed since Beta 3!](http://reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/76tg13/feature_cover_sheet_access_from_reachability_is/)
What bug?
I think the purpose of the Air in the current lineup is to serve as the entry point in the portable macOS ecosystem. I definitely see a lot people where I live buying the Air due to the price alone. 
Yes, they should. But of course, you still have to at least explain the issue you have experienced. 
No customer should have to compromise with this workaround. Take the left one to Apple for a replacement. It's free since they're still not a year old anyway.
> I thought the deal was that they connect immediately

I thought this, too. This is quite my only gripe about the AirPods since it's actually faster to simply plug a wired earphone's jack than to wait for the AirPods to connect to a device.
The EarPods, for some reason, always finds a way to slip out of my ears when they‚Äôre on. 

The AirPods, on the other hand, was a different experience. The lack of wires were not only liberating, but also enabled them to actually stay in my ears. 

They never unintentionally fall out of my ears. I was skeptical at first, but honestly they‚Äôre the best purchase I made this year so far and I bought them back in January. 

If you‚Äôre on the fence, get one now. The worst that could happen is you don‚Äôt like them. Thankfully, Apple offers a return window for scenarios like this. 
Not with that attitude 
I'd be interested to see how general performance will be for you after a while. I'd like to try the "Reset All" toggle, however I fear this will remove all my downloaded music offline from iCloud Music Library and downloading them back would require so much data.
> iOS has been slow on all devices which are more than 2 years old since forever.

Except that iOS 6 runs well on the iPhone 3GS, and iOS 10, too, runs fine on an iPhone 5.

This usually happens. Historically, we've all had buggy major releases; iOS 7 and 8 are back to back buggy for example, and there are major versions which are fine iOS 5 - 6 for example (aside from the battery drain in iOS 5 due to iCloud), and finally, releases that are quite buggy at release but end up being polished at the end of it's lifecycle, iOS 9 and 10 for example.
I believe custom keyboards crash way too often because they‚Äôre only reserved around 64mb of memory by the system. 
I‚Äôm on a 6 Plus too and I‚Äôm wondering if you‚Äôve attempted to do a backup & restore before? I personally would like to try it out someday myself in hopes of having better performance. 
I‚Äôm on a 6 Plus and last night I experienced a brief power outage and my phone was at 5%. 

I had to resort to bumping up the screen brightness just to look for stuff. It‚Äôs understandable that the flash is disabled for the camera, however the flashlight function really could‚Äôve been useful for situations like this. 
the best and most expensive*
Do you get stares when using them to talk to someone when in a confined space like a train? 

I tried them before and I did. I just assume people thought I was talking to myself due to the lack of the usual wires. 
Actually each AirPod had two microphones in them. One at the bottom and another noise-isolating just below the vent at the side. These work together with the speech detecting accelerometer inside the pods. 
No. They‚Äôre enabled. Other troubleshooting steps I‚Äôve tried are forgetting the AirPods in the Bluetooth settings and hard resetting them to no avail. 
Wondering why it says the app version for you below the app name, when [on mine, it just says the date.](https://i.imgur.com/e6JFD2Z.jpg)
You can‚Äôt check the AirPods‚Äô battery while they‚Äôre charging inside the case because the case has no Bluetooth chip itself. Therefore, the case must be opened to check the battery status. 
I‚Äôm curious which device are you on that you experience a delay when screenshotting?
I think it‚Äôs weird how people were panning the iOS 8.4/9 Music app UI back when it debuted. People were clamoring to have the iOS 7 ‚Äì 8 era Music app back then. 

People are weird. 
I‚Äôm on a 6 Plus so I‚Äôve been used to stuttering, but it would really be great if Apple would at least take the time to have a release focused solely on the performance of animations especially for older devices. 
Take note that battery percentages are a rough estimate of the actual battery remaining in a product. Also, the AirPods case stops charging the AirPods when the case hits 5% battery. 

With all that said, the AirPods case used to experience a drain issue when they were first launched last year. People resorted to workarounds such as hard-resetting or re-pairing them to fix the issue. Above all, the AirPods also  trickle charge while inside the case which should only cause a minor drop in percentage like overnight for example. 
Literally who told you all of these stuff?
Sucks how we have to resort to workarounds just to achieve a smooth UX, when really a user never have to do that in the first place.
But the sidebar is now missing/hidden.
It doesn't happen as often for me, but it's quite annoying when it does.
Now, if only Reachability would work on the Cover Sheet, too especially on the widget screen.
The App Switcher is still very stuttery for me. Other than that, the phone feels smooth so far, but it may also be placebo at the moment. 
For me this bug only happens when my internet connection is acting up. 
I believe John Gruber stated that the reason why it isn‚Äôt on the older iPhones, is because the iPhone 8‚Äôs camera is fast enough that the haptic feedback would not have any effect on the process of capturing a photo as opposed to implementing it on older devices. 
I don‚Äôt have 3D Touch but I am happy for you guys.

On a 6 Plus, the unlock animation is almost non-existent if not extremely choppy. App Switcher UI stutters horribly as well. 11.02 was actually better, which is where I came from. I‚Äôm quite surprised by this regression. 
Curious how old your AirPods are. 
Does one AirPod die earlier for you? I got mine in late January and my left one dies at ~3:30ish and the right can last about 30 minutes longer. I wonder if this is normal degradation since I legit use them all day. 
They aren‚Äôt designed to seal well, let alone even provide a seal. They‚Äôre open earbuds and listening to high volume is generally unsafe for your hearing. 
is this Hebrew
Oh so this is why the currency won‚Äôt switch back to Lingots anymore when I switch from another language to Korean.
I think it‚Äôs more of memory leaks rather than restriction. 
Damn even on beta 2 performance is still not improved for the 6? Yesterday there were posts about performance improvements, but none made it to the 6, I guess.  
I‚Äôve always envied how Europeans can easily travel and end up in a different country. 
[In this photo, at the top you can see the extra keys in landscape for 4.7‚Äù devices. 5.5‚Äù devices for the one below.](https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2014/09/keyboard-extensions-100437668-large.jpg)
Yes. Also colloquially known as ‚Äúthe notch.‚Äù
Oh no. It looks like the update got stuck in pending for me fooling me into thinking I‚Äôve already updated. 

Apologies for any misconceptions. 
But you shouldn‚Äôt have to do that. 
u/Geert76

You guys can hide the VPN icon, though. Go to the AdBlock app, tap settings, and toggle the ‚ÄúShow VPN icon‚Äù to off. 
I‚Äôm thinking it might‚Äôve been removed for feature parity since the iPhone X has to accommodate the TrueDepth camera system. 

I would love to have it back as an option, but we both know how much Apple lets us customize our phones. 
Just as irritating how the extra function keys are now gone in iOS 11 on 4.7‚Äù and 5.5‚Äù devices. 
They‚Äôre not officially designed to be water resistant, however if you look at the iFixit teardown, you‚Äôd find gobs of glue inside the AirPods, therefore building on resistance against water. However, if you plan on using them in the shower, do so at your own risk. I‚Äôve definitely seen people here before do the same thing with varied outcome. 
Since iOS 9 introduced App Thinning, that was the case. I used to download apps I use on iTunes, too for archiving purposes. 


I don‚Äôt restore often as another user have speculated, but my main issue is that where I live we don‚Äôt have much options and restoring GB‚Äôs of local data from the cloud could take a whole day since I‚Äôm not as fortunate as some users in this thread. 
I mean where I live, our home Wi-Fi plans are metered as well. 
Yeah this is what I thought, too. It makes no sense to analyze your photos while on battery power since it‚Äôs such an extensive process. 

Also I vaguely remember on WWDC last year on stage, Craig Federighi or Phil Schiller said that this does indeed happen while the device is being charged. 
I just wish Apple never removed, or had a different solution for managing apps from iTunes. 

I run on a metered data and I download the apps I purchase on my phone on iTunes, too. So if everytime I wish to do a restore, I don‚Äôt have to sit waiting for my apps to download and waste data. 

I‚Äôm also planning on upgrading my iPhone soon and it‚Äôs a step back for me in terms of efficient data management as someone with limited monthly data. 
*laughs in 2016*
I used to experience this on iOS 10 as well and I thought it‚Äôs only because my 6 Plus is out if RAM. Nice to see (or not) that other devices are experiencing it as well. 
My current financial situation prevents me from updating to the iPhone X. And I‚Äôm turned off by the glass back and the weight of the iPhone 8. 

The 6s Plus is still a capable device with NVME storage and a powerful A9 processor with 2GB of RAM, which is the same amount in the current iPhone 8 (4.7‚Äù) model. 

Unfortunately, where I live, Apple products increased in price rather than have a drop due to a weaker local currency and Apple‚Äôs Upgrade Program isn‚Äôt offered here. 

I‚Äôm certain these issues with iOS 11 will be resolved in future revisions, though. I remember back in iOS 10.0, my 6 Plus would take >4 seconds to wake up from sleep and that was fixed in subsequent iOS 10 versions. 
> Also, iPhone 6 was limited to 1GB RAM

This is the biggest problem I have and I own the 6 Plus, so it's a lot worse. It's been crippled from the beginning and if you're doing multitasking like using a word processor application, and doing some research in Safari, goodluck keeping all those tabs and that word processor app open all at the same time. 

Even worse, performance seems to take a significant hit if you're doing something in the background e.g. updating apps, downloading music, or even listening to music. I'm looking to update to at least an iPhone 6s Plus and I honestly can't wait.
Unrelated, but OP are you on 11.1? I noticed the VPN icon is bolder than mine on 11.0.1.
Man, I envy your clean looking case. 
Yeah it‚Äôs an obvious feature, but have you given thought at how much space/or implementation would it possibly take on the already jam-packed AirPods?

 I recommend reading through the iFixit teardown of the pods to see how much space is already occupied in the AirPods‚Äô stems. 
If OP wanted to tinker with a bunch of tweaks/settings, they would have gotten something else. 

Also, OP mentioned they were using an iPhone before, so I‚Äôm not sure about the point of this post. 
That‚Äôs a really nice looking band. 
Pardon as I‚Äôm not much familiar in this situation, but doesn‚Äôt Qualcomm hold patents for this type of thing?
I feel like this is where people don‚Äôt realize how jam packed the inside the inside of the AirPods are already. I recommend looking through the iFixit teardown for it. 

Basically, the AirPods are already filled with a big battery with a big antenna sharing the space in the pods‚Äô stem. Adding volume control is quite possibly something that Apple has tinkered with prototypes, but either touch sensitivity or physical buttons can only take up so space in the already packed AirPods as I‚Äôve mentioned before.  
AssistiveTouch provides easy access for the Cover Sheet and Control Center. Though, not everyone wants an accessibility button floating on their screen. 
It does. 
Has there been any study that the 7 Plus‚Äô 3GB of RAM was available systemwide last year? I remember some people speculating it was only available for the Camera and I thought that was completely ridiculous, but I really couldn‚Äôt find any in depth post about this. 
Actually in some reports, the SE should be able to outlast the 6s‚Äôs battery due to the SE sporting a lower resolution display, therefore requiring significantly less GPU usage. 
I definitely would love to see a history of my previous ‚ÄúNew Music Mixes.‚Äù It would be cooler if this history is even accessible from the beginning the feature was introduced last year. 
I think it‚Äôs just an artifact of the screen recording feature.
Do you mind sharing a screenshot or a screen recording?
Aby chance you have Magnifier or Guided Access?
What I‚Äôm really curious about is if Reachability in AssistiveTouch is *also* in the iPhone X. 
^omg
I‚Äôm so sorry you have to witness a bunch of horrible people. This god-forsaken site can be beyond hostile at times. 
This is great so you don‚Äôt mind the glass back at all. I own a 6 Plus and I want to upgrade, but I‚Äôm gonna be so broke if I ever break the glass back. 
But do you plan on restoring your backed up data in the future?
I‚Äôm using a 2014 MBA and I just checked. My American Female voice is still the same old robotic one. 

I don‚Äôt think the new Siri voice is exclusive to newer machines, no?
I don‚Äôt mind the bezels at all because of the symmetry. However, if you compare them from the immediate competition, they are humongous so I kinda understand where people‚Äôs frustrations are coming from. 

Also side note, I‚Äôm kinda surprised seeing people who don‚Äôt mind the weight gain the iPhone 8 Plus received. My 6 Plus is 172g and caseless and I feel tired handling it sometimes. 
I think the voice is limited to female American Siri. Is that what you‚Äôre using?
Yeah. I definitely was. Apologies for any misconceptions. 
I believe this is possible for 90 days?
Papa bless
The first batch of AirPods haven‚Äôt shipped until December, though? And they don‚Äôt have any water detector, so you may have luck trying to replace them. 
That Lightning cable looks pretty. Can you tell me more about it, OP?
This removes all dowmloaded music because it disables iCloud Music Library, right?
Possibly because the WindowServer is now on Metal. I remember Craig Federighi saying this in the WWDC keynote.
You‚Äôre welcome. This is so nice to hear. 

A year ago, I was really against the removal of the headphone jack and I thought the AirPods were ridiculous. 

One day, I just got tired of the wires and decided to the AirPods and the past 9 months I‚Äôve had them, I‚Äôve been happy. I don‚Äôt mind losing the headphone jack anymore when I upgrade to a newer iPhone model from my 6 Plus. 
I‚Äôve lost faith. Looking back at the past years, there was almost always something that pops up. Hopefully, this is just a software issue. 

I own a 6 Plus myself and I think the major redesigns have higher rates of experiencing issues hence why I always preferred the ‚Äòs‚Äô phones. This is not to say the ‚Äòs‚Äô phones are free of issues, however. 
Ah here it is, the early adopter issue. 
I don‚Äôt remember him being that click-baity a few years ago. 
You ok mate
Even the wallpapers I extracted directly from previos iOS firmwares zoom in weirdly when rotated, though. 
Just fucking bug fixes and refinements please. I don‚Äôt care if there aren‚Äôt new features.

I would pretty much like to have a more optimized OS especially for older devices like the iPhone 6 Plus which is unfortunately really gimped spec-wise. 
Yes, you definitely can.
Wow. Thanks you guys. 

u/sicing
I hope you manage to find the source for this again, it would be great to read about it. 
I think most people fail to realize that these are open earbuds and basically offer zero isolation, and therefore it impacts how sound is percepted by the listener. 

Back in 2012, I‚Äôve literally had friends try out my EarPods and straight up tell me they suck while we were in a busy street. 

Regardless, the AirPods sound signature is very similar to the EarPods with a little more oomph in the low end and slightly better highs. They are fine for casual listening but the lack of noise isolation means that they are in no way for critical listening. 

If you‚Äôre into audiophile grade Bluetooth earphones, I recommend checking out the RHA MA750 Wireless. They‚Äôre about the same price range with the AirPods, offer audiophile grade audio quality, and is backed with a 3 year warranty. However, they‚Äôre not truly wireless unlike the AirPods since the RHA‚Äôs have a contoured neckband. 
Get it. They‚Äôre worth it. Easily the best purchase I made for this year. 

However, if you‚Äôre looking for noise isolation, you‚Äôre better off looking for noise isolating earphones with silicone ear tips. It‚Äôs generally unsafe to expose your ears in loud volumes for extended periods of time. 

With that said, I believe Apple offers a two week period to return any product purchased from the if you‚Äôre unsatistied in any way. 
Did you register your face or were you watching her unlock using her face?
Actually if you enable even the regulat Invert Colors, even in iOS 10, the Apple Store app will automatically refresh to make sure the colors are not inverted as well. 
It would be really lovely if you guys can share some photos in optimal lighting? I‚Äôm looking to upgrading to the Jet Black from a 6 Plus myself. 
Oh wow. That feature actually sounded nice. I was wondering whether the Watch have that capability from the start. 

Have you read anything regarding the removal of the feature, or any personal hypothesis you may have?
u/MikhailT had an interesting source above in [this comment.](http://reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/71klry/news_craig_federighi_says_3d_touch_app_switcher/dnc1rnm)
I don‚Äôt own an Apple Watch (but am currently looking at owning one), can you tell me more about this?
I should obviously get coffee first smh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
The never specifically specified that they go past 64GB on their current phone, though. 
Unfortunately on Android, and non iOS 11/10 devices for the matter, the double tap feature is only for Play/Pause. 
> I hate how Apple is losing their touch from being unique and creative.

lmao. I miss the dots too but you can‚Äôt just dismiss them as that without thinking about other factors such as the limited space in the iPhone X status bar and feature parity for all the supported devices. 
> I don‚Äôt think many people realize this, but there‚Äôs no touch sensors on the AirPods. 

This so much. Also, I find triple tapping at least to be the most fool-proof solution. 
The clock never animated prior iOS 7. 
One trick I‚Äôve learned is that you don‚Äôt have to continue pressing hard on the left edge to evoke multitasking. You could just simply press the left edge, slide right a little, then quickly let go. 
I have the opposite issue where it‚Äôs my left one which dies faster. 

[I even started taking notes of my AirPods battery usage.](https://i.imgur.com/SQLFUK8.jpg) Even after I‚Äôve hard reset them, I still get the same amount of battery. At this point you should pay Apple a visit. Only thing keeping me from doing that is that 3 week replacement from where I am since we don‚Äôt have Apple Stores, just Apple Authorized Service Repair Centers. 
Any reason why you‚Äôre not considering the iPhone X?
Unrelated but I want to know what‚Äôs keeping Apple from bundling at least a 1080p camera for the MacBook Pros. Could it possibly be a space constraint like the 12‚Äù MacBook‚Äôs 480p camera?

On another note, I know the upcoming iMac Pro will have a 1080p FaceTime HD Camera. 
Have you seen that from a reddit thread from this subreddit yesterday? If so, the comments there stated that Apple‚Äôs website was updated and it shows the same amount of failed attempts before the iPhone X locks out. 
I mean by the looks of it now, the iPhone X is the flagship phone. 

Also when announced on stage, Tim Cook said something along the lines that the X is paving the way for the future generation of iPhones. 
It might be a little helpful if the battery's age/current cycle count be determined, too. coconutBattery for macOS can tell you your current charge cycle. 
The thing is, they probably built prototypes of those devices, but ultimately decided on a different design. 

I've never owned a 4/s or a 5/s myself but for the brief periods of time I held one of them using my friends', the sharp edges especially when the device is naked was concerning for me. 

Also possibly, why Apple probably made the corners rounded was to create an illusion that the phones weren't as big as before considering how much they increased in sizes. 
The AirPods, just like the EarPods, doesn't offer any noise isolation. You might want to check out noise isolating earphones rather than exposing your ears with loud music to drown out background noise. 
i actually would like to see a footage of this
I had the 3GS from 2010-2013 and the home button started to wear out in 2013. I wish I started to take advantage of AssistiveTouch when it was introduced. 

My current iPhone 6 Plus still has a functional home button, however it's flushed. Something I never thought home buttons with Touch ID would experience, but alas, at the end of it all, the home button prior the iPhone 7 is a moving part, therefore is susceptible to wear and tear. 
Some people can't see past a product's design. 
This happens because there's dust getting inside the charging case. Therefore, preventing contact from the charging pins of the case to the AirPods. 

A simple blow inside the charging case should fix this issue, but may become annoying if have to be done repeatedly. 
If only it would be essy to implement the wireless charging chip on the already packed AirPods. 
That was a weird moment for me. It's almost like they're assuring themselves that Steve would be proud rather than proclaiming it. 
Do you not experience the iOS 10 battery bug on your device where the phone shuts offf even with 30-40% of battery remaining?
People think chargers push power into the phone/laptop/accessories. They don‚Äôt. Devices pull. You can charge your AirPods case with the 10w charger, it won‚Äôt pull more than it needs.
Wait so does this mean I can't get complete app packages anymore?

Since iOS 9 introduced App Thinning, I used to download apps onto my iTunes so it's the complete .ipa downloaded and not just specific to my iOS device. 

This is particularly helpful for diagnosing issues when backing up, then restoring especially for people with an inconsistent internet connection and or limited data. 
Can you comment on the performance on your 6 so far? Are there any notable stutters, particularly when evoking control center?
Super Retina Display sounds like a really weird name to me.
The camera Portrait features, which blurs the scene behind a subject, is available on the iPhones 7 Plus, 8 Plus, and X. Only the 8 Plus and X have the new Portrait Lighting feature which let you alter the scene lighting, and only the iPhone X has the Portrait features on the front facing camera.
I own a 6 Plus myself and I have been itching for an upgrade. It seems like I can't find myself to liking the iPhone X since I'm still clouded by my initial judgement with the notch. It was the only thing I could focus on the entire time they were presenting the new device. Also because of its hefty price tag.

The iPhone 8 Plus is looking to be more of the upgrade better suited for me, despite the price/significant weight increase. However, I think the 7 Plus is still capable enough with the A10 Fusion chip which is still fast by today's standard.
The iPads used to have a regular cycle of updating on a yearly basis. Since 2016, Apple seemed to move on from this schedule. What's safe to say is that the most recent iPad Pros are powerful enough to last for more than a few years, needless of whether an update is coming or not.
It was the only thing I could focus on while they were showcasing the device the whole time.
I'm pretty sure no one can give a precise answer yet until someone gets to try it for themselves.

Craig said in the keynote that swiping *down* from the **right** ear of the device is what triggers the Control Center. Perhaps swiping *down* on the **left** ear reveals the Notification Center/Cover Sheet.
It *may* be more than just the two cameras. The new devices have an all new camera sensor in addition to a new much more powerful processor also containing a new Image Signal Processor. These are all possible technical limitations that may be easy to miss.
Well I'm practically on my phone basically most of the time I'm awake. 

When I'm in commute, I'm either listening to music or catching up on my reading list. When at uni, in class sessions, I use Notability to record voice memos and take notes. On my free time, I'm also either doing some reading or getting some work done. When hanging with friends, most of us often use social media to share and preserve special moments. 

Even before the battery bug issue on iOS 10, wherein the device shuts down even with 30-40% left, I have to charge my phone multiple times a day to top it off because it's basically an essential part of my daily life. 
I mean we all have different usage patterns. 
Active noise cancellation would be a welcome feature for some, but it would pretty much be pointless considering the AirPods' open ear-earbud design. 

Also, one more hurdle for implementing this is battery life. Currently, the AirPods last 2 hours for phone calls, unless Apple finds a way to implement larger batteries in the limited space they are afforded, it's still kinda useless for their open ear design. 
Did you perform this while on a 6 Plus?
I've definitely seen some people say they have the update blocked due to the battery bug.
