Awesome! I am very interested in the G3 series
Lovely
i have the discount as a brazilian student
on S8 8.0 it works flawless, quite interesting.
had some fun during work lol
well, i loved the ad, it was fantastic
and I love the curved edges
no problems here, and I visit for updates every week.
never had a issue, performance is great since day 1.

the only thing I did was to reinstall windows, that`s it.

I even mined some bitcoin, just for the fun
Needless to say that I just spent several minutes playing with the options....thank you!
Geez, I own an Android device for the last 5 years at least, why are we getting this just now?
iPhone has it for so long! =(
How would they? They would need to update their phones first in order to do so. 
I just bought the S8, first day using it lol
Love that place, awesome pic!
TDB all the way
Mine is a Qualcomm QCA61x4A, only recently I started to have issues, after updating all drivers and bios. #SAD

Even though it remains connected I have huge packet loss, so weird.
IP67
Since it's a new laptop, why don't you reset windows to factory?
It should fix it, as longs it is a software issue.
you don't really need all that, it looks good tho.
I attached a pen and locked it with zip-ties, works flawless.
You could use the 3D printer itself as a pen plotter to draw the circuit.
It is quite awesome to watch

Nice Job!
Exactly!
But I bought mine on November, before this whole hype by Gearbest and its $150. Still, I have two "mods", a fan on the power supply (it's really hot where I live) and a tiny fan on the mobo.
the connectors actually, the ones before were underrated
Well, I never installed my mosfet and I am still running on my stock PSU. I have printed a lot! Several rolls of PLA, ABS and now PETG.

ABS is the only one I keep close watch, because 100C on the bed isn't easy on the system, but no problems.....
Gotcha, I have two mods only.
A fan on Power Supply and another one on the mobo.

I don't understand why so many Anets catch on fire.
I have an A8 for almost an year and never ever had a problem with it, but I did all the wiring very well.


Were you able to get the parts printed?
I live in SP, not capital.
Nice!

I printed the P51, I have an Anet A8 and it came out awesome!
I used the gcode that they produced for the MK2.

The only problem is that it is really hot (>230) and no fan!
I'll upload a better picture.

It's a Brazilian brand, 3DFila, Red Spider ABS, nothing really special.
I'll make another and see how it looks after a bath of acetone.
Never tried that way, will do it today tho! hahaha
I added my picture to the thingiverse, width of 0.68


Nice print! Gonna try it mysef, I like how vase mode works!
Do you change your layer width?

I love deltas! so neat!
I bought the same glass from china and cost me about $10.
I have an Anet and it works pretty well in my opinion, and I have printed with PLA, ABS, Wood and Flex. All of them, flawlessly.
It works since day one and I printed over 8 rolls of filament so far.

Even if you end-up with a Prusa, an Anet will still be a great machine to have, specially for what it can do and for that price point. It will an add-on.

Have FUN!
You should get the A8, it's not bad at all.
By doing so, you will get into 3D and you also get the chance to see if that truly is what you want.

I have an A8 and things come out great!
I just finished it, one question made me laugh though.
"Do you save money with 3D printing" (something alike)

So far it's been just a hobby, but a very expensive one.
I still enjoyed it, so much fun.

Good luck!
I liked the green tape! Nice!
I haven't tried metal yet, but wood is based on PLA so you should be able to do it. Good luck
Mine is still printing! I just got the wood filament (and forgot my fan duct).

I liked the previous eyes. It was funny!
Good job!
How about you print some in wood and apply varnish, imagine how awesome! Charge for an extra fee.
just let me know when you downloaded it
https://1drv.ms/f/s!AkZf_J9H4RpFga8IK_dEEmiG3TtpoQ
It came with some stl, gcode, instructions, list of parts, draws of motherboard, troubleshooting, drivers and software. At a total of 487 MB.

On default firmware and printing from a SD Card
Menu / SD Card / Pause or Cancel

It may take a few seconds to cancel, but pause it is instantaneous. 
no no, english!
Awesome place:

Did you install a mosfet? The Facebook group has a lot of info about it.
No! Wow, looks pretty good.
I will definitely try...thanks 
PLA, but I love the possibility to acetone-smooth a print when is ABS.

I don't think you needed supports.
The design says isn't needed.

I have the same printer and I'm still trying to get rid of the ghosting.
I have that printed too, but it is too large to stay in place =(

Anet A8 can produce awesome results.
I've yet to try the USB option.

People usually recommend using a card due the fact a print will fail if the computer hangs, sleep or "crash".
There is an option, SD Card, there you can PAUSE, STOP and RESUME a print. It works flawless.
they fixed it, it's a new layout due to melting hazard when printing abs
whatta place to work, awesome!
I also have an Anet A8.

Mine is pretty good and I have printed quite a lot!
Have yet to add the mods that people do, and still I get beautiful results.

@topic, I get a better bridging on ABS.
How long did it take to print and how much material?

Imagine a whole set of chess on that size, O.O
I hope it doesn't fail, and good luck on removing supports.
I hate removing supports.
Currently I'm using a MK8.
But haven't tried ABS yet, PLA only.
Sometimes I feel lucky to live in Brazil.
The movie will be out tomorrow *-* 
Exactly!
IMO Maps is just better. Waze tends to be too aggressive in shortcuts and avoiding traffic. Visually, Maps is much cleaner and easier to understand.
Since 2012, before that all I had was iPhones...yeah
I have iPhones as my work phones this whole time...

I agree, any .5 isn't worth it anymore.


It is a great tablet, but they have this touch screen ghost touches.

You gotta learn how to live with it
I rather use jumps, but both have pros and cons imo.
And you save up some de 
As  did this, do it!

Th9 needs so much elixir that wasting with full storages seems wrong.
When I started 8.5 i focused on getting my drills maxed. Best decision ever. I even skipped lab for that matter.
Sometimes I actually feel bad for some th8 I raid.

They literally can't do a thing to protect their bases from a th9 full army.
No really a feature of IOS 9, but for the people I Know.

Shake to undo

Most of my friends and colleagues don't know it exists and it's been here since my iPhone 3g.
It takes some time, I rushed my alt account to th8.
Ouch, it's been tough....lol

#woulddoitagain
To be honest, it is going to be very nice.
Too many messages could be spared due its useless context. This is going to be, for me at least, a 48h of peace.

Although, I've been using a VPN connection to use it, but most of us are not, still good.

Their decision to ban WhatsApp was as u/charminer said, it did not cooperate with a court order.
THEY DID SUCCEED IN ONE THING, HOW TO RUIN A GAME. CONGRATS
Weirdly enough, I got a shield and 28+ trophies. 
But lost a lot of resources.
I drink about 1L/day. I am doing fine, probably could do better without it, but i freaking love it!

I drink 3 times more water, and the soda is sugar free.
Did not see that coming, nice example!
Mine has the small and a space that can be used as a holder or be upgraded to a larger unit, as yours.
cool, I thought it would be a whole day work
Great job!
It looks awesome.

How many hours did you spend setting it up?
Made me laugh! awesome job!

Quick question as a new th9, did you farm all your DE?
Lukus4win, 9
hahaha cool, were you mad at him or something? lol
They would jump, as they dont really need a space like in real life ^-^
One jump spell could also do the trick lol

you are the attacker, right? good job
lhaither

Lord jag says that if needed one more, he is in
Lukus4win, 12
I tried it once, it costed me about 10k DE.

They managed to reach the core and get DE but not the 40% minimum for a shield...
I did get tons of trophies, but not worth at all
You don't really have to and there isn't much I can do with your clan name.
I am very curious, that's all....
Have you checked if there is any videos?
You have to upload in "ORIGINAL" size to use space.
As their new approach is unlimited storage on pictures they call "High Quality" option.
Gowi/Gowiva/Hogs/Giwi/Giwiva+ spells

You need wizards, something to meat shield for them and spells here and there. Of course, wallbreakers are a must.

The problem when pushing up, it will hurt you loot, even with the bonus.




May we know the name of your clan?
Just for fun.... ^-^
Search "moto x play" on Youtube and filter by upload date.
You will see quite a few hands-on videos.
It isn't.
Its been available in retail stores throughout Brazil for a week now.

I loved that phone

I havent finished my skulls yet!

Too much indeed

That looks awesome
I had trouble registering too.

I used my phone number and then I got pass the login screen.

I have the same feeling. I've used NFC a couple of times, and just for testing purposes. 
exactly!
I don't want anyone behind me...lol
If true, tears will roll down
Just in case, get your VPN/Proxy ready.

better safe than sorry
It could be, next time I will ask someone that works there.
It's a TV antenna
Good luck to you, certainly will be missed
Their voicemail transcription sucks, to say the least.
I do, at moment my Th (8) and 2 elixir storage are on the outside, no traps.

BUT, is useless, I keep getting raided for DE by th9.


I think you made the right choice. 
Your Moto X is much better than the New G. 

A much better processor, higher screen quality, probably a faster RAM, more storage and better support.
lukus4win, 24
Moto X 2014?

I like the idea, as well as one war for TH8 only, or TH9/10, or simply TH7s if we have enough.

I dont like the idea of goblin attack.

If one uses BK to destroy mortar on the right, loons would go straight to AD. PErfect 3 *
5 months and I'm done!
You should tweak it a bit.

You could be 3 starred very easily, follow this:
Lightning on far east AD, dragons on top AD and then loons on "bottom" AD.
That is my entire loan =[ 

Would you share with us? *-*
and thousands of DE wasted....
Awesome, the problem with zapping is that they don't usually shield you. Thus you get zapped several times in a row.
9,99 here
lukus4win, 29
From what I saw on Daddys video, unfortunately no =(
> Storages can't be zapped anymore

FINALLY!
lukus4win, 30
Thanks, I got one.
lukus4win, 25
I don't zap, but i think its okay. It is a strategy, but give the shield!
My TH is on the outside, no traps, decorations around it but people don't even bother to drop a barb over there and shield me.
It was not respected...
lukus4win, 29
Hahahaha
it took me a few secs, awesome.
What?
Still 5.1 I already have it for at least a month now
To be honest, I expected less.
I really thought they were going to ruin this movie, after all, I enjoyed it.
It was not the best movie ever, for sure, but very pleasant. 
lukus4win, 20
That is pretty much what I did, or am doing.
The difference is that I upgraded my wizards and giants before barch and minions before hogs as well. Now I am going for minions 4, before hogs 4, since I had the 30k de and lab was free.

I should point that splash def is really important, as you said, I get raided a lot by TH9 with Giants and Barch.

I am planning on max everything.
I understand the temptation of rushing a bit to get all the new troops, but I tried something similar on my 2nd account and I regret a lot.

Right now, I've done all elixir upgrades needed, except for goblins and WB. Now, gold is something I'm strugling with.
lukus4win, 27

Now if they show that it has a great camera I wont believe them. It will be too perfect.

I have it installed, the problem is that I created my village on an iPhone 5S. And it now it requires a newer version of iOS to load my village. Even though I can start over, I cannot keep it saved on GameCenter.
I can't have my account on my iPod 4th gen.

It needs a newer ios....it sucks.
I really his videos, I wish he could make videos more often, tho.



You should try 8.1 first before you move up, since it is a lot more similar to it.

To be honest, I thought that ME and Vista were fine OS. I had way more trouble with XP and its spam messages.
That is a great photo!
They were a lot, I missed a lot of them. 
I think that just one got duplicated.

When I had the app, I turned all location settings off.
I still used to check some of friends location, and I showed them, man, were they scared.

I did some like that, I kinda regretted.
I maxed th4, but collectors and rushed straight to TH7 on my second account, of course.
I just now maxed th7, but walls and bk, and I am not sure if I will ever do that again. Sometimes I want to rush to TH10 and get just war troops, but then I remember how long i've on my main account on TH8 and havent maxed everything.

good luck on yours, you can fix it but you get rolled several times on the way.
so true, but as prepaid, it might be just ok
Moto G was 19.95$ on best buy
Maybe they are rolling out to selected users. I am on the same version, and a Moto X 2nd Gen.

Thx
It is not showing on mine, and I tried a 60fps video.

Could you please post the app version...thx
I paid 35$ on a brand new Moto G.  On best buy. 

It's a very decent device. 
why hide the clan name?
So we couldn't find your clan? why not?
Good luck!
You'll be missed
Good job on recap

BTW, nice touch on my name ;)
A youtuber got 2 star on a max th10 with mass dragon level 4.

Seems pretty good
Drill, IMO, so you get more DE overtime
Isn't whatsapp better and has more users?
To be honest, my first clan had a serious problem when comes to donation. Sometimes it took several wars to fill my request, which was "defense, any".

Imagine your base without protection of the clan castle, I know it is not going to save you but it is definitely a help.
Exactly,

Believe it or not, but on second account, my clan is very bad and they were trying to kick everyone who didn't have more donations than requests. So closed minded.
hahahahaha, L stands for my first name.

I like the way it looks...
on the other hand.....
What I've learned so far is that there is only one choice:
loot or trophies
I believe up to Crystal III, after that things get a bit too complicated.

At this moment I am dropping trophies, Crystal is too unpredictable.

last episode he just went full retarded.

But notice that he says "houses" instead of apartments.
Great explanation, btw.
Yeah, they do wonders to keep people entertained while waiting for the actual ride
Yep, believe it or not that's the actual name.
So weird tho
I really like Poços de Caldas.
It is a nice city, not too crowded nor too big.

Perfect sized city with great things to do and eat.
Gated community, that's the word you are looking for.
De nada =D
But why did you do that? lol
I hope you didn't get hurt
I ruined my day when I went there for the first time.
Had to go home.
I will never ride the that Wheel, it is way too insane.

BUT, you should definitely go to Indiana Jones.
Matterhorn is alright, nothing great, just good.
Pretty much just like me, but I've been to Crystal.
Keep in mind that Crystal looks cool, you get the gems and find a lot of DE. The problem is that you get smashed a ton, won't be able to 1 star a lot of bases and the revenges take a lot of trophies from you.

I am dropping my trophies now, slowly as I favor loot instead of stars.

My attacks are basically archers and wallbreakers. Sometimes, 10%, I use 12 giants as well.
Before bed, I cook some wizards, wallbreakers, giants. Just to be fancy on my morning raid.
Shane was pushing things too hard and too fast. Ricky did it smoothly, so when they noticed it will be too late.
I am trying this, with the exception that I've built the 3rd testla and AD.
Technically,

8.5 > 8.10

But I really know what you meant
As a fresh, really fresh TH8, I got all to 11 when th7.

Haven't touched those yet. They are really expensive and I need all the resources now.
I've the same issue, i've been wondering if a LCD + Digitizer replacement would work.

My touch wont work unless a keep one hand on its edges. Which proves the grounding issue.
OHHHH a dual core.
I focused on the broadwell part, my bad, didnt even noticed that.

I believe Intel is focusing on its ULV processors, since they are pretty great. You can expect the HQ line to be available Q2 2015.


They are, and the i7 you mentioned is one of them =D

The Intel Core i7-5500U is an ULV (ultra low voltage) dual-core processor based on the Broadwell architecture, which has been launched in January 2015. In addition to two CPU cores with Hyper-Threading clocked at 2.4 - 3.0 GHz (2 Cores: 2.9 GHz), the chip also integrates an HD Graphics 5500 GPU and a dual-channel DDR3(L)-1600 memory controller. The Core i7 is manufactured in a 14 nm process with FinFET transistors.
Sure,

Here is a news to read more, if you may:

Link to the store:

They are available.

A bit expensive tho
You should move to a better clan. 
ahmmm, it is a joke.

Sign up online and they give 10$ worth of credits to play at the arcades.
I got 20$ for recharging and 10$ as a promotion. 30$ total, free.

Check the website to make sure current promotion.
hahaha,

Hey! How is it going?
Chanland... looks better lol
I got it too, I liked the movie, and it isn't available on bluray yet, at least where I live.
thank you
Can you record the replay and post for us?

I'm very curious to see/learn how you did it...


Congrats!
the blu-ray rip came out on torrent, yesterday.

Sounds great to me, but, to 
# 1 
we need to set a fixed time to war search. So we know exactly when it will start and end.

# 3, 
I couldn't agree more.
I've seen a base with pines all over the borders. 

It was here o reddit
Hopefully you guys win this time
it is true, but in my case, I would finish lab first. But I see what you mean.
If you actually can afford to keep 5 builders working all the time.
Things get very expensive at the end of TH7.
lol so true
Exactly, Th on the outside is the best way to go, no matter what
Exactly, you'll end up with nothing to build while the lab is still not maxed.
It only makes a small difference at TH9
[http://i.imgur.com/nVVgIbf.png
http://clashofclans.wikia.com/wiki/Cumulative_Costs
According to the wiki, it doesn't change much from the 4th to 5th builder.

I have 4th builder, sometimes I wish I could have the 5th BUT now I have 3 builders in idle and lab is still upgrading....
IKR, about 90% of the time people try to get something from my collectors right after they snipped my TH.

Shame, most times they will get at max 600, no thousands, just 600.
ouch!
DUDE!

Max TH7 here and I have a hard time getting to Crystal!

I cant balance between loot and trophies, because one cant have both!
Today I used my war mass dragon army with 3x rage on a revenge.

I got so much loot that is more than I will get from my war bonus loot. insane profit

The guy decided to take from me more than just my TH, he paid for it lol
The worst part is that you cant revenge back a revenge....lol
please?
Each mass dragon attack that I use costs me 390k elixir per attack.
Not considering donations.

Last war, my elixir from the bonus was 557k. So yes, one lose elixir to win a war. But it comes with gold and DE, which kinda makes it up for it.


I have a simple rule,

If you dont trap you TH, I'll snipe it and leave.

BUT

If you trap the TH, I shall destroy you (lol)
kikado means kicked, they adapted the english word. - / - 
give first = donate before request. - / - 
donate half of what you receive. - / -

@
but yeah, great war
Google servers were down, try again in a few hours
You could buy a power bank, mine has enough juice to charge my phone up to 80% and I paid 7$ for it.

When I want to play restless, I use my tablet (nexus 7 2013) and it lasts a few hours. On my phone, Moto X 2014, it wont go that far but it is enough for quite a lot of raids.
iPhone 5 also last pretty good.

BUT, if you plan on getting a new device, look up for the Sony Xperia Z3 or Z3 Compact, as well as Moto Maxx/Droid Turbo and Note 4 from Samsung.
DUDE, 89% 1 star and all the loot
He will get a 12h shield only
Good job!
Real will take this one 
Lhaither
You could have waited for the 9,99 bag of gems. It is a greater value and you were so close.
I like this idea better than the others.
*your
I support this!

I rather have my TH outside than my CC. Always the closest to the center as possible
I would start from southeast with giants, healers, wizards, a few archers and wallbreakers.
And healing spell
Exactly, I use giants as a shield and distraction, some of the barbs are used as shield as well while the archers to all the dirty work.

I'll be honest, you can't really 3 star a Th7 (except when rushed or poorly designed) BUT you usually get at least one star and not rarely two stars.

Not just collectors though, If done properly, you get into the core and get the storage as well.
I find them very handy, specially when the only thing defending is a ground only weapon. And 10 minions on max level on th7 is exactly 70 DE.
I am almost to end of my TH7 and I jsut started to have fun with loons and minions. Try it.

Barch is boring, mass dragon costs too much. I make my balloons raid army during the night.
I only use dragon to war or maybe, just maybe, for a revenge.
A full mass dragon attack (level 2) with 3x rage spells costs me over 375k elixir. You can't really farm with that.

So, to farm (i am a th7) I use 12 giants, 4 wallbreakers, 10 minions, and 1/3 barb + 2/3 archers.
During night, I add wizards to the list.
I believe you need to have it done before the war ends....hurry up
Th3 I found one in global, a few weeks later the merged to another clan. I stayed there for until I reached th7, and left once the clan started to fall apart. On my last day, it took a whole day to fill my CC request

I then found a Reddit Clan, best thing ever. 
Real, he can't right now

It was sunday, bored as h*ll and nothing else to do.



I find it very hard to get to the upper leagues.

Revenges take away so many trophies. For instance, yesterday, I lost over 150 trophies in 2h, in just 3 revenges. And is so hard to revenge yourself.....
try one reddit clans

I've been playing since last December (i know) and I hate the waiting time. I hope not to give up, it is a great game.
lol I actually laughed of this, here's my upvote...

Btw, I copied this, I'll use this on my friends....thanks!
Right? 
When I was going from 6 to TH7 I had more resources than I could hold on to it. So I moved my storage outside my walls and next to my TH.

During 6 days, most people would attack everything they could, about 10% would take the TH, resources (300k each) and leave.

Shame on these people, now I got a tesla there.
I've playing since December, 4th (2014) and I maxed TH6 and now finishing the upgrade to TH7.

I bought my 4th builder on TH4.
I think you have to be awesome to get 3 stars over there, but on my opinion, the best way is using giants to hold the hits, archers and barb with a few wizards next to archers.

Of course, wall breakers. See if you clan donate high level troops for you.
No healing spells

The TH used to be where the Giant Bomb is, I moved since I have 6 days to loot and only 2M storage. Let's share.

The only left to upgrade are my collectors, which I'm doing.
To be honest, can't that be taken with GG, Archers, Wizards and wall Breakers and maybe a healer? 
About 12 GG + Healer, 10 Wz, 8 WB and archers.... That should be enough, his base isn't that great.


And I would attack from south, take the AD down and release troops
*May I have your account, please?

You're welcome
I'm very sorry to inform you that isn't that easy to find good bases there.

I've been on Silver 1 over a week, and didn't get anything above 300k.
I am very sorry, but I did it myself a couple of times...I'm TH6

I had no idea hahaha
maybe canadian players?
Should I upgrade collectors? I have all of them on lvl 9 and I moving to TH6. Everything else is maxed out, but it seems not so important to upgrade them immediately.
