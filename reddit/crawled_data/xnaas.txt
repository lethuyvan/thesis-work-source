At the moment, yes. I still have to workshop the AutoModerator stuff just a bit. Regex is a bit tedious at times. Sorry!
Ooooooohhhh, I didn't even know that cable existed for these. Fuck. I need one. Work forced a new MBP on me and plugging it in places is a bitch.

Thanks!
What extension cord are people talking about in this thread?
Hey /u/Jaron780! Did you have to set the repo to read-only and stop development because of recent events?
Yes, that's just if you're hosting. Every other port can be changed from default, but I don't see any way to change the port for voice.
If anyone is wondering, RCON is over TCP if you're forwarding a port for external access (other server admins/mods or whatever).
By the way, I find the DMs hilarious, but with the name uncensored (throwaway or not), the mods might remove your post, since it does technically break Reddit rules. Just fair warning.
Hah, I didn't mean for NSFW tag. I was more wondering (since I haven't seen the show) if that's her blood or someone else's, lol
Unfortunately, this does not work for me. Server list is still blank. Oh well.
I have to wonder about that blood... 🤔
Yeah, I always use archive.org to backup original quality files otherwise they'll just end up getting lost. :)
>  I have several users though, and let people request whatever they want

I let people request whatever they want, but I deny requests and do shit manually. I've intentionally setup shit so I can't let it get *too* out of hand. :D
They go to web.archive.org, so you need to actually open them in a browser.
In case you're serious, that bot is for users who use incredibly shitty mobile apps.

Just so you know, it's `shoot 'em up`. You put an apostrophe where the missing letters are, not randomly at the end of a chopped word. It would be `shoot them up`, but you remove the `th` and are left with `shoot 'em up`.

Hello /u/Achalys!

I wanted to let you know that by using link shorteners, Reddit automatically flags your post as spam and removes it. I've approved it this time, but since it's so old, you will probably want to make a new post and avoid link shorteners.

Hello /u/RafflesiaReaper! Just so you're aware: Reddit automatically removes posts and comments that have link shorteners in them as well as flagging them for spam.

While I know many will disagree with me, I've gone ahead and marked this as NSFW because it's quite sexually suggestive even without any nudity or pantsu.
[My other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/8d4hu4/plex_randomly_becoming_unresponsive_until/dxkgh1j/) may or may not be of assistance to you, I don't know. I just shared what worked for me and hope it can help at least one other person! :)
I'll link you to [my response to OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/8d4hu4/plex_randomly_becoming_unresponsive_until/dxkgh1j/). I struggled with the same stuff y'all are talking about for *months* and it ended up being that simple, for me.
The problem that, I believe, OP is describing and the problem I encountered is: Plex *is* up and accessible. It just never loads anything in *any* app or web UI. You cannot play anything. As far as PlexPy and *anything* else is concerned, Plex is up because it can be talked to, it's still logging stuff in the logs folder, and everything *appears* to be functional, but you will not be able to actually *use* your server to list, view, or watch media. The only solution is to restart Plex.

Make more sense, maybe?
Wish my update this morning would have done that. :'( Still at 6 like a regular noob.
The problem with that, is I had the same setup. Plex is still "up" in OP's (and what *was* my problem) scenario. It's just not responding. PlexPy never detected it as down, you can only tell there's an issue by trying to access it via the web.
Have you already tried disabling [Enable Plex Media Server verbose logging](https://i.imgur.com/KmMByKy.png) in Server Settings -> General?

I ran into a very similar problem, based on your description, for a very long time and that ended up being the fix. May or may not work out for you.

Edit: I'd also like to link to [my Plex thread](http://forums.plex.tv/discussion/275606/plex-crashes-token-overload) I'd made forever ago where I ended up discovering the root cause.
Based on /u/The_Siege9's [comment](https://reddit.com/r/Animewallpaper/comments/8cswgl/sagiri_eromangasensei/dxhjcst?context=3), it sounds like they added some stuff to make it a better wallpaper.

You only need the Official app if you want instant push notifications. This will be the case for all 3rd party apps as they do not have access direct access to Reddit servers, they use an API with limited components exposed.

To my understanding, the gist is what Reddit is slowly moving towards:

1. User makes a post to the entire site
2. User moderates that post, all comments, etc.
3. There are no "subreddits" or "organization" per se, you just find users to follow and follow them and their posts

The point of crossposting is that it allows more communities to see stuff/work and links to the original post.

That's all well and fine, but I'm not even subscribed to /r/gaming or /r/justcause. I, and I'm sure many others, would have never seen the post without it having a post here. The point of cross-posting is exposure so more people can see quality content.

If I had a phone capable of that speed over WiFi, it would only take 16 seconds to download 2GB. :P I *can* plug my phone into ethernet, but I think that's "cheating." Still, at a theoretical speed of 400Mbps over WiFi, I'd be looking at 40 seconds to download the game.

Sorry to kick you while you're down.

Edit: And before anyone asks, yes, I'm in the US and I pay $74/mo for gigabit.
Fair enough, and interesting.

Was just curious because I'd never seen 7zip failing come up in discussions before!
I'll be honest, I haven't ever had this problem or even seen a complaint in the millions of "WinRAR vs 7zip" threads I've come across online until now.

Out of genuine curiosity, what kind of archives did you run into those issue with, if you remember any details about them?

Just a LPT: move from GoDaddy to basically literally anybody else on the planet ASAP.

You can Google any number of horror stories, but anyone who's been using domain registrars for any good amount of time knows that GoDaddy is the absolute worst and most bottom of the barrel option possible.

They will quite literally give your domain away to someone else if they're willing to pay a little bit more. They don't even give you notice, you're just suddenly not the owner of your domain.

That cheap, yes, you're definitely asking for a unicorn's golden egg, unfortunately. If you can spend $200-$250, you have some real options available, even if they aren't the best.

Alternatively, if you still wanted to go the Pi route, you could transcode and downscale (probably to 480p) all of your media beforehand using ffmpeg or handbrake. The Pi *might* work out in that case, but I'm not entirely sure.

If you're still looking for cheaper option in the $100-$150 range, you'll definitely have to look at old and used stuff. If you can find something older that has a [CPU that supports Intel Quick Sync Video](https://ark.intel.com/Search/FeatureFilter?productType=processors&QuickSyncVideo=true), you can rely on hardware transcoding in Plex which means the CPU can be any weak trash.
If you have the storage space, having both doesn't really hurt. I can't imagine also needing the 5.1 audio track, though.

You could always perform a quick personal test. Rip a single episode with both audio tracks, play both in Plex and see if you hear any differences. I think you're unlikely to and better off "future-proofing" your collection with just the better audio track.

Alternatively, you can always play with ffmpeg (Handbrake might also be capabale of it?) and play with downsampling the audio yourself. Though I think that route might be a bit excessive and lacks the ability to actually enjoy that 7.1/5.1 later.
If that's the case...good lord. 😵

Whoa now! Understanding that terminology changes over time? Absolutely unacceptable!
Unless they keep pushing into the bubble, anyway.
Every definition of non-volatile memory ever? If you'd like a plethora of sources, feel free to Google something like "define non-volatile memory."

I realize this is a software-related subreddit and not a hardware one, but good lord. The agressive ignorance present here is truly astonishing.
Lol, you're fine, man. It's Sunday, my brain is running on minimum too. 👍
Non-volatile memory just means memory (or storage) that does not lose its data when not powered. Flash memory is literally, by definition, exactly that.
Fair enough, I see what you mean!
I do think a more central starting location would be good for especially newer players. Makes the center of the galaxy seem like a more easily obtainable goal and would likely encourage more exploration. 🙂
...how is the Thargoid threat only relevant to rich people? I'd think a CMDR with little to no money for rebuy costs would be much more threatened than someone with billions to spare.

It sounds weird not contracted, but makes perfect sense.

A better sentence would be:

>You need to take the springs/tarp off.

But, again, it's fine.
...you've never seen one of the most used contractions...?
"Flash" has been referred to as "flash memory" since its inception, quite literally, though. It's still non-volatile memory.

Edit: Don't get me wrong, it's generally accepted in the modern era of computing that "memory" should really only apply to primary system RAM, but that does *not* change the fact that technically (read: literally) flash memory is still non-volatile memory.
If it was flash storage (SSDs, etc.) it could *technically* be referred to as non-volatile memory.

Alright, but that still falls under "bandwidth isn't free." Akamai is not cheap. :)
I don't think CBS wants the slogan "4K for Amazon CBS subscribers only!" on their service.

Edit: Additionally, this still doesn't address the fact that this is expensive (Amazon isn't going to take CBS' stuff and stream if for free) and CBS doesn't have an insane subscriber count unless they've posted some impressive numbers somewhere I haven't seen.

No matter who is streaming CBS' media (CBS, Akamai, Amazon, etc.) it costs money. If CBS could brag about streaming 4K, don't you think they would do it? Someone at CBS decided it's not cost-effective.
I do what I can. I *really* hope we get blurays. While the beginning of ST:D really fucking sucked, imo, the show will definitely be sexy af if we get proper blurays. <3
Seconding AR. That was my first "private" tracker (outside of AB) and I used it to farm a huge multi-TB buffer right away with a ridiculous ratio and just used that to get into other stuff pretty quickly. From there, it was just a slow slog into the "best" stuff. :D
I think you greatly underestimate the cost of infrastructure and overestimate the number of CBS subs. Netflix can afford to upgrade their infrastructure because they have nearly 120 million subscribers.

Unless CBS gives enough people a real reason to subscribe, they're not going to make enough money to upgrade their infrastructure to support high bitrate 4K streaming. And, as far as I know, since they're releasing their shit on Netflix to non-US folks, that already most of the world as "not a potential subscriber" right there.

Are you trying to do real-time/live transcoding?
As a Texan, this speaks to me on a spiritual level.

So a local example would be `ftp://192.168.1.101/coolshare` or `ftp://fileserver/coolshare` or something like that. External access would be `ftp://PublicIP/stuff` or `ftp://your.domain/coolshare` depending on how your stuff is setup.
>Also, FTP seems like it could be the answer but then I would need to have everyone download a third-party app like Filezilla to set it up and it wouldn't be as integrated/intuitive as I'd like.

Actually, if you're using plain FTP (not SFTP or FTPS), you can map FTP shares natively in Explorer. I don't recommend just using plain jane FTP, but just wanted to point that out.

Hardware transcoding will always ^(I'm sure I'll eat my words in the distant future) look worse. I gave up on hardware transcoding in Plex due to the number of bugs and the constant crashes. Turned hardware transcoding off, again, and Plex hasn't crashed in weeks.
I'm a bit late on this (work and shit), but that massive filesize was painful. [PNG compression level 9 to the rescue.](https://i.imgur.com/qlMXoob.png) ([non-imgur file](https://ia601500.us.archive.org/17/items/Chuuni-butt-1440p-nsfw/edit.png))

Personally, even though I don't own an iPhone *now*, I'm hoping they move to OLED on all their models over time. Might actually tempt me to give Team Apple a chance. ;P
The iPhone X has an OLED display and I'm willing to bet /u/ccrama (along with other 3rd party devs) has already or will be putting the AMOLED black mode in the iOS app too. ;)

Me too! I wish I could have afforded 8x10TB up front for my RAID10, but I'm only sitting at 39% full thus far. We'll see if I make it through 2018 before having to buy an expansion bay and more drives!
Just like to chime in on this. I have 8x8TB IronWolves that are up to 6100 hours with 0 bad sectors as well. My DS1817+ keeps the pretty cool on the "cool" fan speed most of the time (38C right now). In the summer...I do have to run the fans at full speed most of the time, though. ^(Fortunately I have tinnitus and the sound helps keep the ringing away when I'm trying to sleep!)

All of us use female characters, actually. Still definitely never heard anything other than a grunt. :/ But I think we're on the same page at least, as long as you're not calling the "ouch I got hurt noise" *screaming*. :P
>Edit: Not reading too well. Sorry bout that ;)

Don't worry about it. It wasn't the best written couple of sentences I've ever written.
Is this what everyone thinks a scream is? Because for some reason I'm getting downvoted for never hearing *screaming* in PUBG. Neither has my group while we've played and never have I seen or heard screaming from any characters on any livestream either.

Either Reddit has a fucked up definition of screaming or y'all are hearing shit.
Played on and off since early, early days of beta. Not once have I ever heard my character scream. I've heard maybe a grunt here or there at worst, but that's about it.
I think you should try reading my comment out loud. 😉

Edit: Unless you just accidentally replied to me instead of someone else.
PUBG. Neither I nor any of my roatating group of ~6 people have ever heard any character scream when shot. Unless they literally added that this morning, since we were just playing last night.
Ummm...what game are you playing?

I'd hardly call *not* opting in "disabling," but yeah. Can't see why, if they implemented it, Netflix would be any different. It'd be beyond retarded to make it *not* opt-in.
Spotify is opt-in that requires you specifically signing in and allowing access. Why would Netflix be any different?
You could get the [lowest tier FeralHosting box.](https://www.feralhosting.com/pricing). They suffer from over-provisioning on some of their servers, but 10Gbit (most of the time) and unlimited bandwidth is nice.

I left them to go with [SeedHost](https://www.seedhost.eu/seedboxes.php) short-term until BuyVM releases their Block Storage, but SeedHost doesn't have unlimited bandwidth. Hasn't been an issue since I most do backseeding for several TB of torrents, but thought I'd throw that out there anyway.

On a personal note, I love AAC. Yes it's proprietary, but damn you can get some decent quality for the reduced filesize over MP3. And practically everything supports AAC and has...for like...awhile.
AAC isn't Apple's though? It's called [Advanced Audio Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding) and was developed by	Bell Labs, Fraunhofer Institute, Dolby Labs, Sony, and Nokia.

I would not. The rest of these commenters are delusional. The good compression *definitely* causes issues on even a 4th gen i5 overclocked to 4.8GHz if you're playing a demanding enough game. A popular example would be Battlefield 1.

>And what do you mean by crosspost support?

The semi-new Reddit feature: [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7a5ubn/crossposting_coming_soon_to_your_subreddit/). They did expose it to the API.

Edit: To build on this, meaning to see *when* a post is a crosspost and click the relevant post. Also to crosspost via the app as well. I don't use the default Reddit app, but supposedly the feature is pretty obvious on it, idk.

Edit 2: [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7a5ubn/crossposting_coming_soon_to_your_subreddit/dp7c6fc/) should have the most relevant/useful info.

Only manual updates:

5. Set **No auto-restart with logged on users [...]** to **Disabled**.
6. Reboot

With this configuration, Windows will only ever check for an update if you **manually** click "check for updates" and it won't autorestart once you do check for updates manually as long as you're logged in. I think it *will* reboot if you're logged in and leave the computer locked (Win+L) or something, however.

It's fine within context. Context is always the most important part of anything. If I say "D2" in /r/DestinyTheGame and I was talking about Diablo 2, the only game worthy of "D2," they'd be quite confused, since they'd think I meant Destiny 2.

On this subreddit and when talking about this game, there is no other gun that starts with M4, so it's fine. If they introduced the actual M4 or an M4-anything, then people would be expected to clarify.

Additionally, when trying to communicate quickly in voice, it's so much easier to distinguish what gun you're calling out with "M4" and "M16" rather than "M416" or "M16A4."

All of that aside, I get it. I'm as pedantic as the next guy, but just saying, within context, you're fighting a losing battle. :P

There's a plethora of articles from last year talking about all the fantastic improvements to Linux in Hyoer-V on Server 2016, so I can only imagine a bunch of things have been fixed.

Sorry for not going too into this on Christmas day, and more importantly, mtly vacation. 👍

>But get comfortable with ssh/cmd line only

Definitely! CLI-only definitely speeds up workflow significantly once you're familiar with it.
I believe Ubuntu and Debian both offer GUIs out of the ~~both~~ box. Ubuntu Server might not, however.
>Unless you didn't know it listed individual cities

I guess I'm blind. :'D
From my understanding (no experience with it, as of this moment) it's drastically better on Server 2016 than 2012 R2. I know 2012 R2 was *full* of deal-breaking caveats, but I haven't been able to find any comprehensive list of issues on 2016.

I'd do some testing, but don't have the ability to play with Server 2016 at the moment.
I was thinking more /r/TitlePapercut, but... :P
I wish they went deeper than just counties (city level), but it's still an excellent resource.

Edit: Never mind, I am blind. :D
No kidding. All these years and accounts later and you'd think I'd have learned by now! :(
Thanks for that calculator, by the way. Haven't seen that before!
I sympathize. Working IT in a company that just *doesn't* care, it's really draining. You want to make things better, but you're just shut down at every chance and you know everything is just ready to blow up, but there's nothing you can do. That feeling of helplessness is awful and I'm sorry you have to deal with that frequently.
If you're asking a genuine question, I'm saying that if the person had willingly stayed employed under horrific conditions that caused them so much mental anguish that they went postal, they probably were not in a position to quit their job.

Unlike what some of the commenters seem to think, the only two options are not "quit your job" or "go postal." As /u/jump101 pointed out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/7lwsw3/enraged_naked_postal_worker_goes_on_killing_spree/drptg3a/) and /u/i_give_you_gum did [here, just under jump](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/7lwsw3/enraged_naked_postal_worker_goes_on_killing_spree/drpz2h2/), there are much more complex solutions required to prevent issues like this in the future.
We humbly request that you don't go postal. :)

Dark humor aside, happy holidays and may better opportunities come your way in the future.
Indeed, maybe next year. Would have been nice *this* year! Unfortunately, *some* the people replying seem to think that "quit your job" or "kill people" are the only two options that exist.

Edit: added "some"
Yessir! ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Honestly, I'm mostly disappointed in myself for expecting better.
Astonishing! Someone has realized that the issue cannot be simply boiled down to "quit your job or murder someone." Must be a Christmas miracle.

Edit: oops, hadn't seen the ninja edit before I replied. You seem to have awful reading comprehension abilities, as my edit alluded to, if you really think that that could *remotely* be my position based on that comment.
Not everyone is in a position to simply quit their job and be unemployed.

Edit: The lack of reading comprehension and narrow-minded, 2-dimensional thinking evident from some of these replies is my Christmas gift this year, I guess.

I'm in Discord 24/7. Even when they have a short 10 minute problem, I'm painfully aware of it. 😭

Don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting five 9's of uptime, but their uptime does leave a lot to be desired compared to something like Slack. 😛

Definitely check out [the November postmortem](https://discord.statuspage.io/incidents/mpzkz7m4fzpt) and there was another global outage earlier this year that was [supposedly the result of a faulty CPU in Google's infrastructure](https://discord.statuspage.io/incidents/dj3l6lw926kl). That one's a good read too!

Edit: Edited to include links for the lazy.
I mean, you can see [thier historical uptime data.](https://status.discordapp.com/uptime) I'm just giving them shit for their couple of global outages last month. They had to reboot their entire infrastructure at least twice. Their postmortems are always enjoyable to read, even if they try to blame Google for everything.
HH seems unlikely to me, but...anything is possible! Plus, there's no way they'd miss a chance to have an X in there. It *is* more e**X**treme!

In case you missed the edit a few comments back:

> Edit: Also, you realize $3000 (as an example number) spread over 3 years is only $83/mo. That's an incredibly sane amount of cash. Even if I had spent $10,000 on pot for personal consumption (unrealistic, but an example nonetheless), that'd still only be $278/mo. Again, not astronomically insane.

I'll just go ahead and assume you're a troll at this point. Perhaps bored on the shitter, idk. Try to smile today!

Edit: The troll gets caught and goes full retard! They did so well for so long! ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
TIL "selling some pot" = "drug empire" lol, get a grip on reality, man.
Yeah...I didn't realize how irregular my "early start" into that shit was until I got to college and most of my peers had only just started smoking...

Edit:

>Wait, so you were smoking thousands of dollars worth of weed in middle school, is that what I’m reading here?!

Obviously I wasn't smoking alone. This was with a close group of 4-7 friends (fluctuated). That's a lot of pot for one person. :P
You're right! Dealing drugs isn't profitable at all! Drat, how could my life have been a lie!

Edit: Also, you realize $3000 (as an example number) spread over 3 years is only $83/mo. That's an incredibly sane amount of cash. Even if I had spent $10,000 on pot for personal consumption (unrealistic, but an example nonetheless), that'd still only be $278/mo. Again, not astronomically insane.
Well when you sell drugs... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Edit: rather than double post, I'll just mention /u/newscommentsreal.

Edit 2: Keep in mind middle school is 6th-8th grade (for me, I realize other middle schools have other grade ranges). Realistically, I wasn't smoking until the summer between 6th and 7th grade. So I guess I was about 12 or 13 or so...god, looking back at this makes me feel awful. I regret smoking so much and fucking myself over (turns out, too much pot at a young age does actually have negative affects!).

Anyway, that's maybe $3000 spread out over ~3 years. Yes, that's still a lot of money, but it's not as crazy as it first sounds. Especially when you're raking in cash later in that chunk of time because you're selling pot to everybody.

Edit 3: I realize most people don't even start smoking pot until college, some in high school. I was an "early bloomer" in that regard. It's been a shitty trade-off. On one hand, I got my shit together by 10th grade (after a mental breakdown in 9th grade) and am doing OK in life (other than the depression). I have a stable job, I can afford to entertain my computer hobby. Had I not started smoking pot until later and getting all of that out of my system, I don't know where I'd be right now. On the other hand, maybe I would have never even tried pot. Maybe my life would be better right now. Who knows!

It's been hard to let go and I still beat myself up over it every now and then, but I'm trying to forgive myself. Who would have thought forgiving yourself could be so much harder than forgiving others?

Edit 4: This has gotten kinda rant-y. Sorry about that!
I was skeptical of your "900,000," but [it turns out...](https://i.imgur.com/dy358hL.png) Obviously the [metro area has a much larger population](https://i.imgur.com/OnWFYFZ.png), but I wasn't expecting San Francisco proper to be so...small.
> forcing them to watch hopelessly as their crypto fortune melts away.

Should have made wiser investments then. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
> This would make me lose sleep.

I actively chose to burn all of my money on weed in middle school instead of investing in bitcoin early. Conscious decision. We're talking thousands of dollars worth of investment. It's hard to let go, but eventually you have to accept that you can't predict the future and you have to stop beating yourself up over it. It took me awhile, but I've moved on.
Ahhh, fair enough. In that case, I direct my feelings at Tumblr! Curse you Tumblr!

$CL: No. I just know they did it. Could you look at the video tapes from the camera in my monitor?

$e5c4p3: ??? Um, sure I can do that.

I go back and check the logs, no one has logged into her computer other than her. I told her that the tapes showed no one on her computer.

I don't have a horse in this race, but I imagine the problem is this:

>the battery lasts ALL FREAKING DAY

followed by...

>I plug it in once or twice

It's not "lasting all day" if you're adding charge cycles into that mix. By that standard of measurement *every* phone is an "all freaking day" phone.

I'm here if you need to talk.
Just canceled my Panda XL 2 order yesterday for an all black Pixel 2 yesterday. It's already shipping and I haven't seen a plethora of QC issues listed every 2 seconds. HTC seems to be pretty decent about not just pumping out consistent shit like LG. :D

Is it safe to assume this feature won't be added to the Reddit API and 3rd party apps will be left hanging?

I get why, even if I don't agree with it. Just want to know.

Wanted to keep my other comment clean of personal opinions.

I use [Slide](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.ccrama.redditslide) because being able to *slide* fluidly and flawlessly around the UI is a fantastic user experience. Customization out the wazoo. /u/ccrama is awesome. Etc., Etc.!
They used to offer much more functionality (Reddit is releasing more and more features with no API so 3rd-party devs can't use them) and provide infinitely more customization and/or usability.

This is by far my least favorite episode. I was actually shocked to come to Reddit after watching that episode and seeing so much love for it. I *guess* I can get the appeal, but I think it was just a poorly executed episode, idunno.

Edit: I don't know how to put everything I find wrong with this one episode into words, but it was just the least good episode for me.

Similar boat for me. iPhone seems more and more tempting all the time, but every time I spend a few seconds with iOS, I want to pull my hair out.

Just to follow-up on pricing for Block Storage for you and /u/xenobian...the official reply I got from BuyVM was this:

    Subject: RE: Offline message sent by xnaas
    Local Time: October 5, 2017 1:13 PM
    UTC Time: October 5, 2017 6:13 PM
    From: fdias@frantech.ca
    To: 'xnaas' <redacted>
    
    Hello,
    
    The block storage will be available in January or so.
    
    Pricing is going to probably be something like $3.00/month per TB for non redundant storage (more or less RAID0) and $6.00/month for highly available (mirrored to another cluster member).
    
    It’ll be available in Vegas for now.
    
    Francisco

So that's a pretty fucking insane deal. With the $3.50/mo VPS + 8TB of storage, that'd only put you at $27.50/mo for everything. That's amazing!
They [announced last year they're were "pausing" new Fiber cities.](https://fiber.googleblog.com/2016/10/advancing-our-amazing-bet.html) They [cancelled a bunch of installations in Kansas](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/15009694/google-fiber-kansas-city-cancellations) where they've been trying to build for 5, going on 6, years now.

In addition to that, Google has talked *endlessly* about how wireless is the future they're pursuing.

While Google Fiber isn't *officially dead*, it's only a matter of time, imo.

Edit: And though I've read a lot of [recent posts on Google Fiber's blog](https://fiber.googleblog.com/), I'm still not entirely hopeful. I say this as an Austinite who has seen Google fail to fight AT&Ts almost 100% monopoly on this city.
Hoping to get /r/AnimePhoneWallpapers thrown into the beta. :)

As an aside, any idea how much longer before #FullRelease of this feature? :D
♥️
The cost was because they were expected to dig trenches because cities and the ISPs they made monopolistic deals with decades ago wouldn't give Google access to pre-existing infrastructure.

So while the end reason was cost, the costs were caused by dumb reasons. That's why I said just blaming it on "it's expensive" is an oversimplification.
> Just look at their fiber project. They could have been the company to push us into the fiber era yet it became too expensive for them.

That's a bit of an oversimplification. I would have gotten tired of fighting per-city ISP monopolies much faster than Google did. I'm more shocked at how much progress they made to begin with.

Note: For Ubuntu 16.04.

Also important to note (sorry to rope /u/TheStalledAviator, /u/withmorten, and /u/FlickFreak back into this almost a week later), I haven't seen any definitive proof that native AAC is on par with libfdk_aac. Most of FFMPEG's own documentation still says that while the built-in encoder is good enough for most people, libfdk_aac is still the highest end AAC encoder.

That said, FFMPEG's docs are a mess. Some places say internal is fine, some say awful, some say ok.

Anyway, I guess, unless you're an audiophile going crazy about dat **#quality**, the internal one is probably adequate these days. That said, I've still found libfdk-aac better in some of my subjective testing depending on the source.
heh, you're fine. Was just wondering if I was missing out on some **#EXCLUSIVE** joke or somethin'. :)

No. Their deleted comment said only 32-bit Windows was affected. That's *literally* false.
This is *false*. 32-bit binaries were the problem. Those install just fine on 64-bit systems. I don't know about CCleaner, but the majority of applications default to 32-bit. VLC would be a common example.

>During the installation of CCleaner 5.33, **the 32-bit CCleaner binary that was included also contained a malicious payload** that featured a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) as well as hardcoded Command and Control (C2) functionality.

I'm wondering if you and /u/dementedness are still using versions made after Opera was sold to a Chinese consortium?

While I never used Opera, I would have lost 110% of my trust in it at that point. Same goes for anyone else. If Vivaldi or Firefox sellout like that to a Chinese company, all faith/trust would be lost then as well; this isn't just me singling out Opera.

Anyway, my original question still stands to both you and OP: Are you still using newer versions pushed out since the acquisition or are you holding onto ancient (at this point) versions?

I was only yanking your chain, anyway. ;)

Sorry Netflix sucks!
[Well...](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=DRM)

Joking aside, DRM stands for [Digital Rights Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management). It's a way to lock you out from using content you've already paid for unless specific criteria are met. In this case, you must have a Kaby Lake or newer CPU *and* you must use Edge or the Netflix Windows 10 app.

In the case of other software, Denuvo is a well-known case of some extra shitty DRM. It requires an always-online connection to their servers or you can't use the software or play the game. Internet's out? Go fuck yourself, you don't deserve to play the game you paid for. Their servers are down? Go fuck yourself. Company died and the DRM can't talk to them anymore? Go fuck yourself. Etc., etc.

This is a horribly shortened version of what DRM is and the different kinds, but figured it'd be adequate.

Edit: minor text fixes
Isn't hardware DRM great?
You need a Kaby Lake CPU, too.

Unlike Android's default, Windows does actually adjust (quickly) over a period of about 30 seconds or so. Android just instantly flips on or off at the specified times and can be a bit jarring. I agree though, it would be better if it adjusted over a 5-minute span or so.

I disagree. I have a very similar problem to /u/AstraSMB when it comes to this part:

>the scroll wheel is too loose and knocks on each side on every sudden movement.

Preface: All G502s referenced here are Proteus Spectrum.

I middle-click a *lot* and don't have any issues with my G502 from Feb 2016 (which I only just bought a replacement for because clicking the scroll-wheel to the right broke on it) when performing the same actions and didn't the entire time before the scroll-wheel-right-click broke. The wheel on this newer mouse is noticeably ***much*** lighter. By swapping back and forth between the old and the new mouse, the new one is the only one where my actions for clicking the mouse wheel left or right are triggered (for web browsing this is zoom in and out). It's unbelievably annoying and driving me insane after only a few hours.

While typing this out, I figured I'd press both wheels for a bit to get a rough estimate of the total difference. I'd say I have to use roughly 2 or 3 times the amount of force on my older mouse to push the wheel to the left or right. And I'm positive this isn't an age thing as this older model did ***not*** have this issue at any point in its life.

I also owned a Proteus Core from release until that Spectrum bought in 2016 that didn't have any issues with this either.

I wish opening the mouse didn't involve damaging the feet on them because I already need to replace this fucking scroll wheel with the spare one from my Core. :/

Edit: And I'm afraid to RMA my older Spectrum now and get a shittier one returned to me. :(
No, the guy you're responding to. 😛
You've caused me physical pain.
I downvoted for the edits. Can't stand that shit. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
In case you still can't read the comment for some reason:

>40% more likley to commit suicide than the average population. Let's hope those numbers hold up.
There are multiple images in this link. 3 of them. Did you only mean the last image?
Has it really been 10 years? Damn.

I take it there's no nostalgia flair or anything?
Turns out, most people like sex! Such an overwhelming number that our world population even keeps increasing because of it. 😉
Funnily enough, the majority of DnD players I know are married and *definitely* sexually active.

You just need to market your software better. 😉
I think the gun range in Battlefield 4 is perfect, tbh. PU could definitely take a similar route.
🤔
I know many, my self included, don't like leaving the safety of Reddit Night Mode or any number of Reddit apps that also have dark modes. ;)

No comments?? This is some trippy-ass shit!
[Source](https://twitter.com/megturney/status/900096388662534144) since no one linked it.
I left Fi, but in my experience, I got updates later (sometimes 1-2 weeks later) than people on other carriers.
You should use ' (also known as apostrophes) instead of backticks. That's why your formatting got all fucky.
y'all*
haha you're fine. We're not rudely giving you shit (I'm not at least), just trying to let you know in a "friendly banter" sort of way. 👍
Ah TIL then! Still, the original point from you stands.
~~Or PrintScreen.~~ Or [ShareX](https://getsharex.com). Or a million other ways that result in an image that isn't washed out and awful.

/u/foofis444 please.
You have no idea how good (however unfortunate) it is to hear someone else is having the same problem. I feel like I've been going insane trying to troubleshoot this over the past week or two. 😭

This is something I wonder often. I mean. That was a *lot* of lead exposure to a lot of children and young adults...
that sucks, sorry man
I had Soul Silver and a pink NDSi (or something) vanish completely one day. Was a sad day. I suspect my shitty brother who isn't really part of the family anymore these days. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
I can buy HGSS on the eShop? I don't think so unless they added it in the last few weeks...
I said this lower down and I'm positive many others agree:

>I want a download, not to hunt down an overpriced physical copy. To be honest, Nintendo could sell me HGSS on the eShop for $40 and I'd just buy it. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Well, *technically* it'd be Pokémon but...
You should specify what resolution you're looking for, if you care. 👍

There's *way* more than one. 😛
GIF is a very old *image* format that really wasn't meant for videos, so here we are.
Good to know.

Personally, I haven't (and won't again!) used Facebook since...jeez...idunno...pre-2008?
> That USB port on the desk is pretty neat!

Pretty sure it's [this Anker product](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/4-Port-USB-3.0-Hub/68ANHUB-02S4A) but /u/Ottetal can correct me if I'm wrong. :P
A shame you can't actually use custom images in Netflix for profiles.
I think they're implying that sentience is well beyond any programming and the Doctor would be prone to mistakes since he can make independent decisions and not just a small set of decisions based off lines of code.
Awesome! Thanks for the info. 🙂
I haven't played the game since launch. Are those base game or are you using a mod that adds them?
[Is that a Tesla??](http://i.imgur.com/TcXbaFm.jpg)
I'm 21 and had a similar experience growing up. We couldn't afford all the fancy new shit, so I just got to play all of the "old" stuff we had laying around.

Always blows people's minds I grew up using floppies, playing the Atari, and watching VHS tapes. Really not that shocking...

Your phone or computer probably just had really shitty color reproduction. Don't worry, that's the majority of displays.
They've been in crates for awhile, unless I'm getting mixed up with something else.
You have to go for crates.

I'd be curious to see what your AHK script (obviously with sensitive information sanitized) looks like.
Shocked no one has mentioned it, but I've definitely run into one or two really fucking shitty situations where tapping T a second time (or more) just leaves it on Tennessee. Have even run into tapping T and using the down arrow not working too. There's some really shitty web forms out there. :)

Wrong orientation. 1080x1920, not 1920x1080. 😉
Of course. :)

Sorry about the bot spam. I'll fix it Someday™.
Should post to /r/AnimePhoneWallpapers. 😉
Just because *you* didn't have one doesn't mean it wasn't around...
Fine! I'll rewatch Enterprise! Are you happy??
Definitely trumps the Windows 2000 machine I had to work on back in December. 😮
idk, he could have worked on the Emoji Movie. 😉
Right? What am I doing wrong and why do my phones/ phone cameras never have any issues...
