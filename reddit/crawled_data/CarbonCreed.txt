After 6 years on reddit, I still don't understand why this specific phrase is the hill so many people die on.  People want a funny, half sarcastic way to say they cried, it's not a god damn war crime.  
Personally I got caught up on the show and then read the books, but that was back when all of the seasons which had been released were good, so yeah that might be a good idea. 
That's just good storytelling.  It's hacking into your brain, exploiting your preconceived notions, and applying them to new situations.  It's not really MKULTRA shit, because it's A, happening whenever you pay attention to something, and B, generally pretty in line with core societal ideals.  Usually it's so effective because of B.  Marvel is so ingrained in popular culture now that their movies have essentially become fundamental parts of the hero's journey in a lot of people's minds, so take that as you will.
It's the obvious play, and the smartest one for Marvel.  It's simultaneously safe yet satisfying; it closes the door on the first "arc" of the MCU while leaving the door open for more.  Incredibly predictable, but hopefully the characters are rich enough for their sacrifices to mean something.  
Yes.  You should watch it, the first 3 seasons are fucking amazing.  
Thanks bruv

To be honest, I like "fluxuated" more, considering it does refer to something in a state of flux. 
He never said that Europeans are better at conquest, and the question specifically asks about the "Aztecs".  I see no implication that they're a completely homogeneous entity. 
I think there were similarly dense settlements in pre-Columbian North America, they were just wiped out by plagues and the survivors somewhat scattered, resulting in the continent being much more politically fractured/sparsely populated by the time colonization started there.  Likely the fact that Spaniards reached Mesoamerican population centers before they were completely wiped out was something of a centripetal force in maintaining somewhat centralized native populations, through slavery/intermarriage.  
I imagine that was likely the result of North America having been already ravaged by disease by the time colonization took off there.  It was extensively depopulated and probably more conducive to settling by families/large social groups than the Spanish colonies. 
Even so, I think it's interesting historically.  My understanding is that most other colonial ventures (India, Africa, certainly Australia) didn't really take that route of integration/"dilution".  
I wouldn't say we're stupid monkeys, we're ingenious monkeys who are incredibly adept at spreading our cultural distinction through any means necessary, even the pathologically sociopathic (is that redundant?) ones.  
I don't think any point of view you could possibly be referencing is naive by any objective standard.
I don't know if I'm misremembering this, but didn't the Spanish colonies promote intermarriage between colonists and natives?  I thought they took kind of an Alexandrian approach to conquered populations, and that's why there's so much more intermingling of European/indigenous cultures in Central and South America than in the North.  For example, the extensive syncretism of Mexican Catholicism.  
A story that's unfolded countless times over the course of human events.  In the grand scheme of things, the conquest of the Americas was perpetrated with no more vitriol than any other war, there was just more opportunity for atrocity and more rewards for doing so.  
Noticed this in Discovery Park, Seattle.  It was about as soft as modeling clay, but stratified enough that it would break off in well-defined chunks.  I don't know if this is uncommon or interesting, but I found it cool.

Oh no absolutely, Clinton is a war hawk in the pocket of industrialists, just like most candidates.  That doesn't mean that trying to find candidates who share your ideals of reform is a fruitless venture.  Primaries, primaries, primaries.  If you want to make a difference, that's where your vote really matters. 
There are plenty of elected officials who espouse those ideas.  Getting involved in primaries and caucuses will help them become more prevalent within parties, to the point where actual change will occur.
Fuck off, your comment is based on like ten ignorant assumptions about how war works.  
It's literally not true, there are candidates within the parties who support campaign finance reform and curbing the power of the executive.  Saying it doesn't matter just shows what a cursory, faux-deep knowledge of the political system you have.

I think one major aspect of it was also a difference in the behavioral norms one would experience in everyday life.  There was more threat of danger inherent in civilian life then than there is now; as such, warfare would have been less of an "elevation" beyond the norms, and probably less likely to trigger a long-term shift in mental state. 
And also a democrat.  Corruption is bipartisan. 
It's really interesting to think about, that their hyperreceptivity to colors accomplishes even less than what we can do with a more limited set of inputs.  It's a fascinating example of two different ways evolution can achieve a similar output; more emphasis on the actual gathering of data, or more emphasis on its processing.  Imagining a combination of the two boggles the mind.

The centralization of power within the ideological microcosm which is "Antifa" is completely irrelevant to the fact that those who willingly associate themselves with the mantle are either implicitly condoning or directly perpetrating violent, anti-liberal, and authoritarian actions.  It's a mindset of superiority which breeds contempt and hatred.  It's inherently divisive, unnecessary, and ultimately more harmful to a democracy than any imagined or actual resurgence of fascist demagoguery.

Do you think I've personally observed religion uniting countries?  I'm talking about self-evident historical trends, well-accepted theories of the psychological and evolutionary origin of religiosity. 
You can't use your personal experience as an argument and then reprimand someone else for using theirs three comments later, what the fuck. 
Yeah, no, trust me, as someone who's gone through the whole, "raised catholic, lived as a closeted atheist for 5 years, finally told my parents and was ostracized," process I believe I have at least an inkling of ethos in this argument. 
Now THIS is enlightened centrism. 
"Religion only serves to divide people," is an absolutely ridiculous claim.  It's united communities, countries, and continents.  It's the single most powerful non-hereditary homogenizing factor in a society.  And proper application has nothing to do with how individuals practice their religion, it has to do with the core tenets which the religion espouses.  Essentially what I'm attempting to argue here is that modifying and modernizing popular religions is an infinitely simpler and more efficacious method of effecting positive social change than trying to convince people that god is a lie.  
Lmao.
Using that standard the only things that have multiple functions are latex gloves, condoms, bubblegum, and swiss army knives.
Kids already caught the autismo. 
Religion has brought evil, but in terms of being an exceptional motivational factor for instilling moral values in society it's brought good on a significantly greater scale.  In modernity we have alternate explanations and rationales for ethical behavior, but rarely do they inspire the same widespread, deeply ingrained behavioral modifications which religion can foster.  We're not yet at the point societally to indiscrimantely condemn those who still adhere to religious tenets as backwards, foolish, or unenlightened.  Applied properly, it's an incredibly functional, if suboptimal, delusion. 
People and society can exist without a theistic religion, and religion has certain detrimental aspects which lead to its natural replacement by other core belief systems.  However, for the entirety of humanity unique interpretations of spirituality and religiosity, though false, have undergone independent genesis hundreds of thousands of times.  Clearly we as a species have a natural predisposition towards belief in higher powers, and this penchant is so fundamental to our cultural modes that to classify subscription to it as "weak" is dubious as best, harmful at worst, and only serves as a way to elevate oneself over the "opiated masses". 
It isn't necessary, but it's a natural product of human psychology and very useful on a societal level.  
Religion is not "fundamentally weak" unless your basis for what weakness is is completely removed from human reality.

I certainly see your point, and in fact originally there was a bit in the analysis about Locke's overreliance on the adherence of others to his preconceptions of them.  My main point of disagreement with you is that Locke's decision to undertake his task is nobly self-sacrificial.  He could have made the decision to spare his family and his coworkers the immense emotional turmoil he stirs, simply leaving Bethan to deal with it on her own, decreasing the gross amount of pain caused by his mistakes.  Of course, in a perfectly empathetic society Locke's decision to form the centerpoint to an interlacing web of conflict would allow him to bear all the load himself.  However, Ivan's actions are shortsighted, moralizing instead of pragmatic.  In his desperate need to redeem himself for his father's crimes, he acts selfishly, creating more pain and suffering than if he were to simply leave Bethan alone.  The argument comes down to whether Locke made the right choice; whether absolute morality is superior to pragmatic morality.  
The fact that Tyler and Kevin have now collaborated by proxy makes me happier than it should.


John Locke is the man, yo.  I didn't mention him just because it's been a while since I studied him and didn't want to confuse his ideas with other enlightenment thinkers.  Pretty much the only reason I even mention the title is as a joking segue into talking about the tropes of the genre/style.

So you're against educating women, genocidal, and can't see a meaningful difference between a medieval society and the present day.  Dude,I know it's cliche, but you're on the wrong side of history, you worthless relic.   At least in 100 years you and whatever inbred as fuck children you manage to have with whatever ignorant, backwoods wife you manage to find will be dead, and humanity won't have to deal with antiquated, racist motherfuckers like yourself. 
Just because a system has worked in the past doesn't mean that another can't be implemented which allows for more personal freedoms, less exploitation, and a generally better society.  Maybe take a step back and look at the context of societies in the past and in the present and realize that shit is radically different on an existential level.  Marrying younger girls was prevalent because of shorter lifespans and higher infant/maternal mortality, making it necessary to maintain the population.  In the modern day we don't fucking need it, and anybody who wants it is just looking for a macho power fantasy of having a subservient mate, which would be understandable in a less socialized society, but god damn man.  Get out of the neolithic. 

Pointless pre-marital sex isn't harmful, it's a general psychological benefit.  Also unavoidable, but like, that's a whole other topic.  Society is past this puritanical shit, if two consenting people of comparable mental faculties want to have sex then they should be allowed to.  The potential harm they can do to each other is no greater than between adults. 

And finally, your first, and most retarded point; obviously parents fear exploitation.  They also fear murderers, but they don't watch their children constantly.  
Because the two 13 year olds are held to equal standards of sexual maturity, there is less chance for disproportionate exploitation.  
Action vs. Impulse. 
It's still outside of the cultural norm in this country, which essentially classifies it as pedophilic behavior due to the standards of sexual maturity which we hold those under 18 to.

The radius of the event horizon grows with the mass of the black hole.  But don't worry, there's a point where loss of energy from Hawking Radiation outpaces a black hole's ambient gain of matter, so they do have upper limits on size.  I think your main hangup on the idea is the term "black hole" makes it sound like some sort of fixed, anomalous point, when really it's just an object.  It's made out of matter, it has mass, it has velocity and rotation, its only unique property is its density.  All the crazy facts about it are just side effects of that.

I can definitely see that interpretation being possible, and I love that you found some more universal meaning in it.  And thanks for commenting on the rhyming.  I've always been a big fan of sonnets, even though they don't seem to be in style on this subreddit.  I don't have any gripes with freeform, I just love having some regimented structure in my writing. 
The emotions conveyed could use a bit of elaboration.  I think the fear could be more viscerally conveyed than a simple statement of its presence.  For example, I think that "body leaves mind" is an excellently elegant and evocative turn of phrase, and some more of that throughout would be welcome. 
The choice of capitalization is interesting.  My only gripe is that "normal people" seems a bit prosaic.  I get that it's the point, but it clashes to a degree with the rest of it.  Overall I think it's got a strong emotional resonance though.  
Get the fuck out of here with that shit.

If there's hardly any mention of human race then adding in intraspecific racism is categorically unfaithful to the source material.  Like, yeah, make Triss the Witcher equivalent of Somalian, I don't give a fuck (although I kinda do give a fuck but that's irrelevant), but if there's also the specter of color-based racism then suddenly it goes from being harmless to fucking with the source material in an unhealthy way. 
I don't think that a lack of racial diversity really makes something a white nationalist's wet dream unless it also espouses an anti-diversity ideology.  The former is a prerequisite for the latter usually, but not vice versa.

How many layers of gun nut are you on right now my dude. 
I agree that postmodernist thought is not a movement trying to enact change.  However, there are movements which use postmodernist thought as a *rationale* for the enactment of societal change.  Those movements have adopted those ideals in conjunction with Marxist ideals, because the majority of the people who populate those movements aren't fucking philosophers and don't recognize that the true versions of these ideologies they've hybridized don't allow for such a combination.  
You're purposefully ignoring my point and his.  Philosophy isn't inherently about gaining anything; in a vacuum, thinking and interpreting things in specific ways provides no benefit.  But for widespread adoption of those philosophies, for them to function on a societal level as forces of change, there has to be an impetus, some material or psychological gain provided to those who treat such a philosophy as dogma.  In order to provide this, what many people have adopted under the guise of "postmodernism" contains facets of Marxism.  

In theory, postmodernism and Marxism are antithetical.  In practice, due to the human mind's inability or lack of desire to recognize its own hypocrisy they can exist symbiotically. 
To emphasize, I don't agree with all of his viewpoints.  I find that the logic behind them is fascinating and idiosyncratic, and uniquely provides the potential for objectivity in a political climate currently dominated by ad hominem. 
"Marxist Postmodernism" as a term is only oxymoronic if you view it as referring to discrete ideology, instead of the product of human hypocrisy.  He touches on it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSzpc2vh8Ow), where he points out that Marxism corrects a fatal flaw in the possibility for human adoption of postmodernism; the lack of an absolute "other".  For people to attach to an ideology, there needs to be some illusion of "gain", but the idealized version of postmodernism lacks that.  By the inclusion of a Marxist "other" (oppressor vs. oppressed), people are more likely to adopt this mutant, self-contradictory ideological hybrid.  The surface layer, that presented to the world, is postmodernist, because its theoretical selflessness and connotation of being the ideology of the intellectual is a favorable aesthetic.  Beneath that is the motivational layer of Marxism; the portion that provides an incentive.  I think saying Peterson views either postmodernism or Marxism as "bad" is disingenuous; he views Marxism as *untrue*, and he views the contemporary, widespread *version* of postmodernism as intrinsically linked to Marxism, not postmodernism in and of itself. 
I think the major dissonance there is his use of the word "propaganda".  Once again, he's not referring to anything conspiratorial, he's generalizing the term into anything which consciously or unconsciously ignores certain basic truths in order to provide ideological confirmation to the masses.  He refers to Frozen as "propaganda" and to The Lion King as "truth" because, in his definition, truth is intrinsically related to the basal human condition, which is closely tied to tribalism.  The main source of confusion is that most people's connotation of "propaganda" is something made with the intention of being misleading, whereas Peterson doesn't see intent as being necessary for malice, and calls anything which doesn't paint an accurate picture of the fundamental form of humanity misleading.    
Can you link me to where he says that bit about films being Marxist propaganda?  I haven't seen that. 
I've watched a lot of his content, and any conspiratorial element in his message is entirely in the eyes of the beholder.  It's entirely possible to use his observations and rationales to support that Jews are controlling the media in order to promote white genocide... if that belief is already entrenched in your mind.  If you watch it without that bias, he simply offers a unique worldview which puts more emphasis on the evolutionary and biological facets of human psychology than a lot of current political discourse.  He appeals to a lot of alt-righters because, on a cursory level, some of his positions match with theirs, and they're too excited to have found a somewhat erudite person who agrees with them (a true rarity for the right) to bother to analyze his reasoning and realize that he's reached those conclusions through logic antithetical to theirs. 
I disagree with him on a lot of points, but many of them are at the very least incredibly refreshing in the current political landscape.  He doesn't fall solidly on either side of the current political binary, and I think labelling his fans as closeted alt-rightists is reductive as fuck.  Sometimes he gets a little carried away in his endeavour to find a universal, trans-human truth, and I can understand calling some of his stances in that regard buffoonery, but he has a strong grasp of Darwinist principles which a lot of modern political dialogues lack. 
Fuck I didn't know I was an alt-righter.  Sad life.

I assume what he means is "make war" instead of "bear arms."  In certain contexts, the two can be used interchangeably (though I imagine you'd usually say bear up arms).  It makes no sense for that to be the intention though; the Constitution specifies the State's power to declare war in like, Article I, and to give the citizens that right is absolutely ridiculous. 

The Constitution gives people the right to own firearms.  That doesn't mean it gives that right indiscriminately however.

The issue is, guns do not present nearly the societal benefit the hoplophiles seem to make them out to be. 
> there'll always be that one dumbass

ONE being the operative word.  What kind of mental disconnect does it take to realize that less legal guns = less illegal guns = less deaths.  It's not about ending all violence, which you admit yourself.  It's about making it less common. 

Unless they're using their beliefs as an excuse to be cunts.
How the fuck is that relevant whatsoever.

People in power promising "prayers" as opposed to actually doing shit is so fucking pathetic.  Like, if you're some 40 year old soccer mom whose son set up a Twitter for you, fine, prayers are the best you can do.  But christ, when the best legislators can offer after a tragedy is "prayers" then there's something seriously wrong. 
Guns have a finite lifespan my friend, as evidenced by the fact that people keep buying guns.

SJWs are neither liberals nor progressives.  A liberal attempts to promote an egalitarian society, but not at the cost of rationality.  "Progressive" is an incredibly amorphous term that constantly shifts meaning depending on the political landscape.  SJWs are a very specific breed who take the egalitarian tenets of liberalism and bastardize them into a fucked up, anarchic humanism where the human experience is an undeniable truth.

Being a muslim is nowhere near as voluntary as being a nazi.

Nazism resulted in the deaths of tens of millions, and everyone who voluntarily identifies as a Nazi is willing to commit or condone acts of violence.  Islamic terrorism has resulted in orders of magnitude fewer deaths, and not every fucking Muslim is a jihadist.

Maybe relationships and sexuality don't define somebody after all."

It's sad, but somewhat inevitable after the left adopted a few common cringeworthy behaviors into their worldview.  Once most of the content on this subreddit became offensive to the hyperleftists, people started posting shit that only had any cringe value because of the offense these imaginary people would feel if they saw the content presented in a mocking context.  

It's happened in every non-PC online community, because the left has a greater number of outraged parties on the internet than the right simply due to demographics.  It's fucking cryptozoology, the people in the community who get off on not giving a fuck post more and more off topic content because offending these mythological trigglypuffs gives them the fantasy of being badasses.

Eventually, the community gets redefined because these people who have some fabricated emotional stake are the most active posters, and that starts attracting people who actually agree with the ideologies.  People who aren't particularly invested in the community leave once it stops producing the content they want, and the whole thing becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.  The moderates leave and the prevalent ideology radicalizes.  I think the perfect example is TumblrinAction, but it's happened here, KotakuinAction, and in a rare twist, went the opposite direction on FullCommunism.  

TL;DR: Hurr durr centrism. 
Trickle down economics only works in the same idealized fantasyland where communism works.

I'll defend that casting, and his performance, to my grave.  In a movie with a more fleshed out Superman, he's the perfect foil for the modern age.  Back in the 50s, 60s, 70s, the foil to a god figure was someone ruthless and cunning enough not to care about Superman's status.  That's what Gene Hackman was, an amoral businessman too self assured to allow Superman to intimidate him.  Now, the ideal foil is someone not just too megalomaniacal to care, but someone so jaded and irreverent as to not believe in Superman.  Jesse Eisenberg pretty much played Mark Zuckerberg, yes, but that's who Lex Luthor should be now.  Someone who gains power entirely by their own hand, a product of the modern age who would be vehemently opposed to the idea of a "god" because their very existence takes credibility away from his own importance. 

I fucking love that Lex.  Last third of the movie is irredeemable shit, the first 2 hours have an amazing story buried in amongst the ruthless sequel baiting.

This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how hard it is to build a computer.  It's like the whole Ahmed thing, where the kid got called a genius for taking a clock apart.  People don't understand how electronics work. 
Absolutely true.  I had a Zenfone 2, and while it didn't look terrible, the plastic back being removable always made it feel cheaply made.

Yeah, there haven't been any shootings recently where the perpetrator had enormous amounts of ammunition and the police took 75 minutes to get to him. 
It's not so much the actual loss of power as his feeling of it.  I don't think it was racially motivated, I just think the power fantasy aspect of it holds some water. 
ha this is cringey I am amused
Regardless of finances, the man had moved into a retirement community.  It's logical that someone facing a slow, uneventful death might choose instead to regain some illusion of power through violence.

Or he's just some psychopath with 42 guns but idk. 
This is actually a major contributor to the difference in suicide rates.  Suicide attempts are a much closer metric, but men are more prone to choose violent, deadly methods like firearms and hanging, whereas women have a tendency towards shit like overdoses with a lower success rate. 
Yeah, that sounds about right.

Nah, it's CLG, he's talking about the obligatory one-per-series A Sol remake. 
And also he refers to himself in the third person.  Why not.
It's so accurate.  Would have been terrible in the movie, but I'm glad it exists. 
Send in the national guard, this needs to stop.

Oh, wait, shit, no. 
This is fucking art. 
Kill yourself you fucking faggot. 
I think that oversimplifies it a bit.  I mean, absolutely the dynamics you are describing occurred, but there were still unprovoked massacres, conscious exploitation, and atrocities on both sides. 
The whole "noble savage" thing displays such categorical ignorance of human nature as to become more racist than acknowledging that native tribes were replete with as many fucking assholes per capita as any European nation. 
You cooked a fucking rodent.  Not only did you cook a fucking rodent, you cooked it incorrectly.

Can I just say that I adore what you've done here?  That you found, buried in these terribly well crafted lyrics (even ignoring the grand conspiracy, Jepsen's lyrics are shockingly concise yet evocative, something I'm glad you brought to my attention) such a richly painted picture of a human life is absolutely beautiful. Even if it's not referring to a specific event but rather a lifelong pattern, even if it's instead a complete construct given form by fictionalized tone and a shocking dedication to thematic cohesion on Jepsen's part, the existence of it is really great. I'm reminded of Wrestling isn't Wrestling, in that the reality of the story doesn't matter for it to be compelling. This character of Carly Rae Jepsen you've gardened in my mind has so much depth, so much pathos; it doesn't matter whether the specific events singled out occurred or not  The discovery of this character dwelling in plain sight is fucking exhilarating, and I feel like I can begin to understand what possessed you to actually create this monstrosity. 
Sadness is common.  Every story has some emotional gradient, one extreme being sadness, dissonance; the other being harmony, catharsis.  You can't have one without at least the threat of the other.  But in songwriting, especially this genre, sadness so pathological, so thematically cohesive, so unified in origin and expression, is consummately rare.

You're assuming the existence of some Transcendentalist universal human moral code.  That isn't something that exists, it's entirely based on cultural influences.  It's reckless to call people objectively shitty for acting in a way which their upbringing never taught them was inappropriate.

No he won't.  Maybe in the eyes of other people he'll be a better person, but intrinsically he won't be any more healthier, well adjusted, or open minded just because he's removed a word from his vocabulary.  You're conflating social stigma and inherent goodness, and that's a nigh puritanical thought process.

Flyquest was not setting up a play there, they took advantage of an apparent mistake by Huhi which turned out to be a bug. 
Here, spell with me. 

L is for LuL, when someone fucks up a play

A is for Aurelion, banned three times today

N is for Nonsensical, or counter-logical

T is for Thresh, who can flay and pull

E is for Escape, which to do Huhi was poised

R is for Rambling, a bunch of painful noise

N again's Nonsensical, like your comment's entire point. 
I think you seriously misunderstand the recreatability of this bug.  It's occurs when:

A. ASol has Banshee's Veil Up

B. ASol uses E

C. ASol is hit by a spell during E

D. ASol wants to cancel his E within 3 seconds of being hit by that spell

It's not quite a get-out-of-pick-free-card. 
Exactly, the game was in their control since some of the earlier fights around baron.  It denied Flyquest a potential comeback, but people make it sound like it cost them a definitive win. 
Huh, I'd think someone with OCD would be a bit more careful with their projections.  
Twitch chat and Flyquest fans think the game 2 remake was unfair. 
In Game 4. 
Everytime I think Huhi has peaked, he gets better. 
Almost every champion has bugs.  This bug is a very specific and avoidable interaction.  There's no reason to remove him from play. 
How wouldn't it be self deprecating?  It's mocking the superiority complex of Rick and Morty viewers.  And nah, I don't have a lot of hope, I just have some basic understanding of human communication.  
"Oh shit, 2 minutes ago it was coming up in 3 minutes, so... yo I don't know how to subtract, how long Lemon?"

"1 minute."

"Aight.  Yo, shit, it's been 15 seconds.  How long Lemon?"

"45 seconds."

"Aight. Yo, shit, it's been 15 seconds."

Fuck off. 
So the "screaming (acknowledged overused meme) or (other acknowledged overused meme)" doesn't in turn scream "sarcasm" to you?  Are you autistic. 
If it were a closer game at that point, yeah, it would be ridiculous, but there was nothing they could have done with that information regardless.  If there was, they'd have noticed it was missing earlier and said something about it. 
If that had mattered, wouldn't they have paused earlier to mention it?
Wow, they sure would have had a lot of possibilities to leave the base and set up vision while CLG was sieging :\^)
Because if they had rewinded to when Huhi casted Q, then he could have cancelled it?  Because he was only out of position because of a bug that didn't allow him to cancel it?  
It wouldn't have been a pick without the bug. 
Sivir is a balanced champion :\^)

That's a gamechanging death, if it can be proven it was primarily due to a bug then they will remake (and they are).
Lmao at these kids who immediately started talking shit about it being a bullshit pause.

No you're right, we live in a society where high birth rate is imperative, lest those filthy fucking foreigners replace us.  God damn it would be apocalyptic if those people who are biologically indistinguishable from us except by a few primarily cosmetic gene mutations were more populous than us.  I'm glad people like you see that the world needs more robust population growth and that half the population should be haplessly foisted into a determined set of life experiences based on a genetic coin flip despite our essentially post-need society not necessitating high birth rates or full-time child care for population maintenance.  I'm glad you have such a firm grasp of demographic transitions and can educate these poor, brainwashed fools on reddit, who think that people should have a degree of agency in their societal roles. 
So what you're saying is that, relatively speaking, this is a pretty good meme. 
GOD DAMN IT CLG DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOOD.

Except if gun sales are curtailed, and new guns do not enter circulation at such rates, over time the availability of illegal ones will decrease.  It's not an immediate solution, but in the long term it would inevitably decrease gun crime. 
The vast, vast majority of illegal guns were purchased legally in the United States at some point.  The easier it is for a gun to be purchased, regardless of how fit that specific person is to own one, the easier it is for one to move into the hands of someone who shouldn't own one.

I love this because it's quite possibly the least suited champion for this style of montage. 
Considering their murder rate is one fifth that of the US despite both countries having nearly an equal level of poverty, I'd say they're doing something right. 
I think a great thing about the length and depth of this show is that as soon as you've finished watching all the seasons, you're immediately nostalgic for Season 1 again.  At least in my experience.

I can't imagine it tacks on an extra price to complete the item, most likely it's like boot enchants where you can choose to spend the extra gold post-completion. 
Horses couldn't have just galloped from wherever the Dothraki landed to Blackwater Rush.  In fact, if they landed far enough from King's Landing that they were completely undetected, they'd probably have made camp at least once if they wanted their horses to not be exhausted to the point of uselessness in that battle.  Any competent scouting tactics should be able to detect a camp of tens of thousands less than a day's ride away, and been able to provide hours of warning. 
Why did it in particular become so ubiquitous?  Was it simply more available?
At this point his character is just him stumbling around betrayed and confused.  And Coster-Waldau pulls it off excellently, I just want him to have some more emotional range in upcoming episodes. 
Dougie threw up yellow mush.  Symbolic of his cleansing from the sins of his former life and rebirth as a pure and innocent CoopBot?  More at 11. 
That frame is, "these characters live because the story is facilitated by them living," pretty much the definition of plot armour.

Fuck it. 
They'd clearly have prioritized its movement, switching out horses to facilitate quicker transport.   The gold is with the army at the beginning because they're still at Highgarden. 
You're mixing up the order of the scenes.  Bronn receives his gold while the army is still at Highgarden, the scene with Randyll is right before the battle at the end, as the army nears King's Landing.  The gold is unequivocally safe. 
Yeah, in the books she's only fire-retardant in Drogo's pyre, the rest of the time she's fully flammable. 
My god, I'm not saying every character should die.  Just that we have no reason to believe that they should live. 
And so far in the show at least there's been 0% setup for that.  At the very least in the books I think there was some hint at a potential Weirwood Wedding. 
I'm saying there's no aftermath in this world to pick and choose your viewpoints from.  It's not historical, these characters shouldn't have guaranteed survival.  They're picked BECAUSE they hold interesting viewpoints, and are good vessels for the story to be told from.  People in positions of power, people who are relatable, people who are amusing.  Those aren't traits which assure safe passage through a story, they're entertaining.  As such, when they survive by the slimmest of odds repeatedly, suspension of belief regarding their vulnerability is thoroughly trashed.  
All the people who've been resurrected have kept their scars.  If Dany had burned to death and been resurrected, wouldn't she be Sandor+Jorah levels of full body fuckedness?
Bronn apparently doesn't give a fuck about armor, so no, he can still probably swim. 
Yeah, it's interesting.  That doesn't make them invincible.  The most interesting stories have interesting ends, and actual tension. 
Rickon has gotten so completely shafted (eh, eh?) in the show.  I hope to god that unicorn-riding badass doesn't get fucked over in the books too. 
Apparently Ramsay is so god damn charming that he can convince Mr. "Don't make the rue the day I raped your mother" himself that he's not a threat. 
These aren't lucky survivors though.  They aren't random infantrymen who make it through on cosmic luck.  They're mainstays of the plot, people in powerful positions, not picked because they survived but because they're interesting.  It's a terrible analogy. 
The characters in Band of Brothers have plot armor because they're a random assortment of people who actually lived to tell the story.  They aren't all high ranking, they don't all have pathos and unique characteristics.  They're actual people who survived.  This show can't use that excuse, nobody's guaranteed to survive at the end because that's the way it happened, anything can happen, it's fucking fiction. 

The show's too scared of losing characters it's invested time into developing to have them die, regardless of how fitting an end it might be. 
I'm sad Bobby never got to make the 9.  North, Reach, Dorne, Westerlands, Riverlands, Vale, Stormlands, Iron Islands, and Valyria. 
That spear wall was 2 deep, let's be real here, they'd have easily won on number alone. 
Can we talk about how much of a fucking idiot Jaime is for thinking a 2-deep spear wall (with some short ass spears) could hold against a cavalry charge?
I was reminded of the Scythians, right down to Dany being a Tomyris analogue. 
How do you miss a fucking Dothraki Horde until they're within earshot, they aren't exactly stealth mode.

I can't pretend to be an expert on this subject, and this comment will likely get removed, but hopefully it can tide you over until someone more learned can provide a legitimate response.

The Greek pantheon did indeed include many goddesses, who were reverenced equally with the gods of equal rank.  However, the roles they played in myth and the virtues they espoused were decidedly feminine, in the classical sense of the word.  It's important to remember that gods are a reflection of their culture of genesis; the characteristics of these deities, good and bad, respectively portray the supposed virtues and malices of the ideal Greek woman.  The interplay between the gods, while not always emblematic of the exact gender power dynamic in Greece, usually found basis in the supposed inherent characteristics of the two genders.  And the Greeks weren't entirely puritanical when it came to the upsetting of normal social hierarchy either; the word "slapstick" famously derives from Grecian comedic theatre featuring the abuse of a master by his slaves.  There was little thought put into the fact that the subject matter apparently touted ideals which, millenia later, would be banned for inciting class hostility in The Marriage of Figaro.  Similarly, the victory of a goddess over a god in myth didn't directly translate to a lesson about gender parity; rather, there was generally acknowledgement of virtue overcoming vice, regardless of whether that virtue was stereotypically feminine and the vice masculine.  A few examples of feminine virtues and vices which the Greek goddesses represent include Athena's propensity for weaving, Artemis' virginity, Aphrodite's vanity, and Hera's jealousy.

It's also fallacious to equate the interactions of gods and the interactions of mortals in the cultural mindset of any people.  Gods were essentially vessels for tales of morality to be told, more one-dimensional tokens of desirable and undesirable traits than the modern, Christian ideal of a supernatural human.  Being as such, there wouldn't have been connections drawn between patriarchal treatment of mortal women and possible offense to the gods, because oftentimes the gods were themselves being used to support those ideals.  It can't be assumed that people would think them outraged at things they themselves find perfectly normal and not morally repugnant.  

Of course, there are examples of the mistreatment of women being found unseemly in the eyes of goddesses; the defiling of priestesses was one of the chief crimes and ill portents one could commit.  But again, this is less because of any social awareness and relies more on the general gaucheness of disrespecting property dedicated to the gods.  

Another point of note is that the existence of women as a subservient "other" throughout history was usually not accompanied by a view of them as inferior.  On a personal basis the roles they played in society were equally valued as those men played, and were not disdained or scorned as being tasks fit only for the weak.  The modern, feminist view of that subservience being emblematic of misogyny or masculine self-aggrandizement is only applicable to a contemporary society, where the importance of the individual and social mobility is more greatly valued.  Being as such, there would have been no moral repugnance to the ancient Greeks for the lack of modern "rights" available to women.  They were simply fulfilling their allotted purpose, as men were fulfilling theirs.  History simply has a diminutive effect on the importance of those classical feminine roles, as they were as a rule dominated by tedium.  Much as the general is more celebrated than the footsoldier, the footsoldier is more celebrated than his mother.

Nien was such a great player.  Shame he never found consistency.  Same with Link.  I think Huhi is the first of the super ragged on CLG players to break the cycle.

Nexus Siege and Doom Bots are already pretty close to wave defense game modes. 
Remember back when Vayne was a late game champion?  Remember back when late game ADC's were a thing?  Good times. 
To be honest that's kind of the founding principle of this sub, short segments of programming which are humorous taken out of context.  Lately it's just become a meme breeding ground, but honestly this is more in line with the subreddit's original vision than most current posts. 
The walls this game were legitimately useful, which is a stark contrast to most Taliyah games I've seen where they range from impotent to completely counterproductive.

You could make a similar point about Cabin in the Woods.  Disdain for the young along with dehumanizing and forcing them to fit into specific, tropey roles.

Typo in the first paragraph?  "Seeks to destroy the leaders of Zaun?" 
Not necessarily.  His point in this video is that in most films, you empathize with the characters; you feel and relate to the emotions they are experiencing.  But in Eyes Wide Shut, the somewhat clinical, inhuman performance (Tom Cruise manages the unique accomplishment of becoming more relatable when wearing a mask) allows you to see the action not through the lens of the character, but rather inject yourself into it.  
Incase, is that you?

The removal of Quick Play is a crime against humanity. I got my 2000+ hours of enjoyment out of it though, so I can't complain too much.

How is this cringe?
This is some dumb shit, but I feel like that was peak reddit.  Back before the 2016 election cycle.  The circlejerk was bad, but it was more confined.  
Have we sunk so low as to post things that are not cringey, but instead things which we imagine the reaction to might just be cringey?

What merit do you find in "potential"?  When does something gain "potential"?  Is every uterus a sacred place which must constantly be producing "potential"?  If they aren't being used that way, then it's essentially the same as killing a potential human, no?

Your entire argument is based on an imaginary line where "potential" begins, a dichotomy which has no basis in biology, neurology, or philosophy.  
Personally I don't feel too torn up about it.  Animals and human infants process pain in pretty much the same way, we're just evolutionarily wired to care more about the latter.  
Dear dear friend, I value human consciousness.  It and human life are entirely distinct things.  
Human life has no inherent value, you're retarded and blinded by your own need to feel important, go somewhere else.

That's a completely retarded line of thought, and once again something which can be applied to the Dijon thing.  Don't be hypocritical. 
And he didn't order a brand, or even specifically Dijon.  He said, "A spicy mustard, like Dijon."  They could have brought him Brown Mustard from a fucking Krogers and it would have satisfied his request.

I had almost begun to miss this meme. 
Exactly, another president who lost the popular vote and utilized a crisis to ensure reelection, stooping to entirely trumped up evidence against Iraq to ensure a long, drawn out conflict.  I'm not going to pretend that taking down North Korea would be a bad thing, I just have no faith in our leadership making it as efficient and painless as possible. 
Get ready people, Trump is going to use a war with North Korea to distract the more bellicose Americans from his broken campaign promises and general shitty administration.

1. The only good press he's gotten recently was a mostly unprovoked and unsubstantiated military strike against Syria

2. Attacking "Communists" will distract his Cold War-mentality supporters from his ties with Russia

3. He's been playing up Kim's intelligence and competence so that when we steamroll them with minor South Korean civilian casualties it's not the global superpower curbstomping a regime stuck in the 50s, it's Trump outmaneuvering a clever dictator.

4.  Trying to improve relations with Duterte to have another ally in the region (Especially since we have military bases there)

5.  Any opposition by the Chinese to this plan will push his narrative that they were the ones behind the DNC hacks

6.  Suddenly Trump is a human rights advocate with a legacy

7.  Who the fuck votes against a wartime president aiding in a merger between two long-separated nations

It's a desperate gamble, but he definitely thinks that Americans are jingoist enough that spreading "Freedom" will save his doomed presidency.

I think he needs to get out of his comfort zone more.  He's gone a bit Lucas, where everyone thinks he's such an auteur that they can't challenge him.  I'd love to see him make another movie like Ed Wood, something grounded but with the trademark Burton surrealism.

Mozart's Requiem. 
This man is one of the greatest actors of our generation.  Imagine a lesser man.  Reading the script to a porno, most look at simply the range of sex positions they'll be asked to perform, so they'll know what stretches to perform beforehand.  Trust me, any actor who goes into a shoot with tight quads won't make it past the Missionary-Doggy switch.  But this fucking guy.  This guy doesn't skip past the first two pages of some suicidal writer's crusty script, he fucking reads it.  And when it comes time to perform, he doesn't give the standard, "This is pornography, I can phone it in," approach.  He delivers the deadpan performance of a lifetime.  No tongue-in-cheek, "Man this dialogue is fucking stupid innit, let's just start fucking, my calves are tightening up again."  He pours his heart and soul into these words, honestly convincing us that he does NOT believe he is at the beach.  Listen to this delivery without video, I swear to god you will be able to picture his surroundings; a bathtub, and not a beach.  That's descriptive expertise which only comes from complete dedication to every intricate detail of your craft.  This man could have coasted along, knowing he got hired because his dick does a bit of a corkscrew instead of your standard ternary left-right-straight bullshit.  But does he?  No, he shows the world that he takes pride in the useless preface to the main attraction, and in doing so takes our gaze from the anticipation of the fucking ahead, instead turning it inward.  Absolute masterwork.

We have some of those in my town.  After a certain point, the "Hide in plain sight" strategy kind of stops working and they've become really conspicuous. 
Great idea.  People buy a shit ton of soda but it's completely frivolous, people who buy soda won't stop buying soda because it's like 10 cents more expensive, and if they do then it's less people drinking soda.  Win win win.

You'd think Peter Jackson would have taken a hint from how shitty most of the scenes he added to LotR were and not tried to make a trilogy that was 80% original material. 
"But I was going to Toshi station to pick up some power converters!"

I love Empire so much because it feels like an actual original movie, compared to the adventure serial homage that is Star Wars.  That's one reason I maintain some degree of hope for The Last Jedi, it will be an original movie compared to the original trilogy homage that is TFA.  
The Rashida Jones scenes in The Social Network.  They're uncharacteristically expository, and Mark's reactions in them feel out of character.
