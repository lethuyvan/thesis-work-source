Gonna argue here that almost every other laptop charger, including Apples until recently has everything you needed to charge in the box.
OK, it's not you that's high risk, it's the property that you are trying to buy.  Banks don't like to finance them because 1) you are only buying the structure, not the land  and b) high renters vs. owners in the park which increases their risk.   

Look for lenders in your area that specialize in manufactured homes. Your other option could be to secure a personal loan for the amount and buy as if cash.
I work in Real Estate and I'm kind of surprised.   While at the top of the affordability chart you certainly should be able to get approved. Not only that but with a good credit score your interest should be low.    Have you tried other mortgage firms?  Are you putting any money down?
Auto industry and Lending is going bat shit right now.  A glut of the population is buying new cars that are truly beyond what they can afford and extending out on massive terms (84 months is becoming the norm).  The auto lending industry is acting like 2005 mortgage bankers. Stated income, longer terms with zero down, it doesn't bode well.  

Plus if the CFPB gets canned you may see mortgage lending get stupid again.
Almost any AGM battery will work better.  Odyssey batteries are awesome, not cheap, but they will outperform any lead batteries and last longer too
Yeah, at this point it may be going back to Microsoft.  Beyond frustrating that I can't tell if the SSD is even detected by the 'bios'.
I want my 20 seconds back that it took me to google this to see if it was fake or not

Sync 3 APIM programming isn't trivial and specific info needs to be pulled for each module in your vehicle.  Granted someone who knows what they are doing can program it quick but I doubt dealerships have any techs that know how to do it.

I only know this because I upgraded from sync 2 to sync 3 in my F150 and had to have the APIM programmed for my specific vehicle and options.
Beautiful - I miss my Excursion so much :(
All the Samsung A tablets have GPS chips in them - the unit I used is NOT cellular enabled.
Samsung Tab A 8" with a 'Fintie' brand rugged case I found on Amazon.  From there used a RAM Tab-tite mount and RAM Yoke mount to keep it on the cage.  Then just used a hardwire kit for any USB device.

Tab is running a few different programs but mostly Backcountry Navigator and Magellan TRX.  I also put a 128GB SD card in there so I could keep plenty of maps.
This is a woman in a red 'jessica rabbit' dress and a wig. Beyond that there is a whooole lot of work that needs to be done with makeup before she's Jessica Rabbit.  This is more Halloween costume than cosplay IMHO.
Another vouch for s5ean.

I think I've got over a dozen keys from him and never had an issue and will continue to do so.
Started with Playstation Vue at 29.99, paying 39.99 now.  I'll live without it if it goes any higher.  They gave me 6 months of the full package for free after raising the price but I don't watch any of those channels.

The ease of the DVR feature is the only thing that keeps us.
You're right on all points.  This is the new normal.
For now it's game over if you are trying to find *affordable* housing in Reno/Sparks and will be this way for the foreseeable future.

Everyone gets tired of the comparison but the reality is that if you want to see where rents and housing prices are headed you need only to look at most cities in California.

Yes, if you can't afford it you are going to get pushed into the suburbs, other communities and other towns that are somewhat close.

Rent is moving faster than home prices in our area currently so if you have the ability to purchase a home, it's probably a better idea.   There are mortgage companies that can do 1% down (not a fan of this but it exists) so if the opportunity arises - for now you are better off buying rather than renting.

Right now there are 51 properties on the local MLS that are available for under $150K
With a 1% down (you put $1500 down) loan (which contains a grant for 2% bringing the total to 3%) you would be looking at about $674.
FYI this is the AVH-3300NEX in the US.
Will something happen? Pretty unlikely.  Can something happen, absolutely.  Depending on where the firing pin is and what is going on, if the ammo you were using has a steel core or jacket then there is a potential for a lot of force (head on crash, rear ending) to *possibly* fire off a round.  Again, I think it's unlikely but you never know.

I'd rather use a car holster that you can put in a similar location and that also protects the trigger as well.
A super strong magnet holding your weapon?  Depending on what kind of rounds you are running and if you keep one in the chamber this could be a terrible idea.
I agree with the first part of your statement but as someone who's been pulled over many a time and also has a CCW you generally SHOULD let the officer know you have a gun in the vehicle, explaining exactly where it is.  Keeping your hands visible the entire time he comes up to the vehicle and is talking to you.

At least as a CCW holder when they run my information it's going to come back that I have a CCW and then I'd have to explain to the officer that if I do have a gun in the car, why I didn't disclose this to him.
Unfortunately the nature of my business wouldn't really allow me to whitelist only.
Thanks for the advice.  I just verified that my number has been on the Do Not Call registry since 2003, telemarketers don't give a crap about the DNCR anymore.

Unfortunately these people calling use a different number each time.  They are spoofing numbers.  I use "Should I Answer" but because they use different numbers it doesn't work all that well.  

Yesterday I started using Jolly Roger Phone Co. as my voicemail, it may help some with this.
I spent over 45 minutes with these guys, i used a credit card generator along with an address generator and told them I wanted $700 of viagra - they were so excited.

Then when the order didn't go through they doubled down on calling me :(
Just FYI - the 125 year plates were the Miner.  I'm trying to find out if you get your hands on a set if you can put them on another car legally.

Just came here to give a thanks to the Op for sharing this.
You've still got a large market of used cars out there that don't have anything like this.  This is also around a $65K truck that not everyone is going to purchase.

I've watched the videos on this and all seems great until they use the full screen navigation and then you can see how slow this is.  However, what I do like is that Android Auto/Carplay takes up half the screen so you still have controls below.  Right now it drives me nuts that when I use AA in my F-150 it takes over the entire screen so I can't change heated/vented seats and a few other minor things.
That trailer weights about 2700lbs dry
A strong modern processor is going to help but as long as your not transcoding IMHO you shouldn't need anything to crazy.

You WILL want a 1Gbps network though, I see more issues with network bandwidth than anything else.
Do you want to just play back 4k content on your local network or do you want to transcode?  If you want to transcode then your budget isn't nearly enough.

Unraid + Plex Docker should serve you well. Unraid will also make the ability to add hard drives easier.


Holy crap.  Thank you for this. Got my headphones on and working at the office.  

Zedd's "Spectrum" had sounds reminiscent of Outrun and this totally satisfies my need to hear more of it.
Op is in Washington state.
You are exactly right with the dealer being the middle man.   It's not just the dealerships, manufacturers have lobbied state governments to prevent "direct sale" dealerships from existing in certain states, which is why you can't buy a Tesla direct from them in a state like Texas.
Not that I agree with it but the dealership isn't owned or controlled by Ford at all.  They can choose to charge whatever price they want for parts.   This is no different than any independent store buying inventory for X and selling it for Y.  

Apple stores on the other hand ARE owned and controlled by Apple so you would expect to see the same pricing across the board.  Completely different.
Swedens effective tax rate is also almost 60%.   There is no such thing as 'free' healthcare.
I think absolutely you should have to have a picture of the passenger. All ride requests originate from a mobile phone and there are virtually  no mobile phones without cameras.

Holy ****ing sh*t.

On the app I filled out I put the delta between my mortgage payment and what I receive in rent which was $300.

In actuality I should have been putting the FULL amount I receive in rent as income which puts my DTI in an acceptable range.

Oh. My. God.  Enjoy Gold for my ignorance.
You are exactly right. I like the current loan because it is also assumable and and in May of next year about $150/mo of PMI will fall off as well.  Maybe I'll just have to wait for another year before I can do anything.
From my research, it looks like I have to have a 2 year history as a landlord for anyone to take this into account.
I have my lender looking into it now.  My interest rate on the house is 3.5% which is fairly low.  I have about $180K in equity on the house currently so we will see.
I'm starting to think that you may be right.
Not enough in this case, the rental income isn't quite enough of a delta.
Yes, I have a credit union that will allow me to secure my loans with some of my assets but I thought perhaps there would be a way to get this off my credit line for the future. 


Glad to read your edit.

I can't explain how good it will feel when you eliminate your debt.  I literally sleep better at night.
Yeah, I prefer to launch using a vehicle that has 4WD at least.   And unlike the bed of a truck, submerging the back of my MH in water generally won't end well.
That's good to know. Thank you.
I really wanted one of these OR a toy hauler until you have to smell gasoline and other stuff while you are sleeping and it gets really old, really quick.  

Went with a 34' motorhome with the chevy 8.1 and Allison 6 speed along with an enclosed 24' trailer and am very happy.  Pulls no problem with the trailer.

I do like the fact that I could have my RZR in the back of that AND tow a pair of jetskis behind but I also don't like launching jetskis off the back of the MH.
It's sexy AF. How much was it to wrap the vehicle?
Is that a wrap or paint?

Do you have navigation? 4.2 or 8 inch screen? Sync 2 if you have 8?

If you don't have Sync 2 or navigation - Any radio pulled from a '14 focus should work as the ACMs are almost identical.   Different build dates and slightly different hardware can make a difference.  
I have these.   I was so thrilled initially with my SP4 and now a year and a month in I'm really fed up with it.  I figured out the constant freezing issue by installing different display drivers but this screen thing drives me nuts.  I'm out of warranty on my device and they want $499 to replace it.   
Real estate brokerage employee here.   They are a small office (each office is independently owned and operated - each RE/MAX franchise is separate from one another)  I'll put money on someone hiring a sign company and said sign company was cheap and just found and grabbed your image assuming you'd never know.

I would call up the Broker of Record there and explain the situation, you aren't looking to be litigious but simply want to be compensated for your work.   I would also ask who created the sign and question them as well.

Most franchised brokerages have to run stuff like this through their marketing and identity standards department.  Generally they are NEVER ok with their logo being displayed on a photo like this, so that's the only thing worth notifying RE/MAX corporate about.
FYI: I located a machine with the same STEFFEVENDENG DECRYPTOR message on it, it renamed all the files but didn't actually encrypt anything.  Try removing the extension and see what happens.  Then close the companies RDP connection and/or simple password.
See my other responses as to why I am trying to accomplish this or at least find a more elegant solution than what I'm doing now.
This is a legacy Gsuite account and can't use the Sync tool.
He owns the company, see another reply below as to why I thought moving to Exchange would be a goo idea.
User knows only Outlook, signs dozens of documents a day.  The Microsoft store for addins only works with O365 or Exchange accounts (such as docusign and signeasy).  User currently logs in remotely to access email

Backing up that PST manually is a pain in the ass.  Thought was to put them into Exchange which would help with backing up.  Also, using Exchange would allow them not to have to use RDP to access their email and have complete synchronization across computers and mobile devices.
EDIT:  I've started buying the parts.
=====

So far I have: 

* Screen: GL3T-18B955-SB  - It's important that you have the RECESSED mount version for an F-150, flush/standard mounts from other cars probably won't fit.  Also, make sure the part number is G or later to have Sync 3.  This cost me $399

* I was able to get an Sync 3 APIM with Navigation for $499 on ebay (any Sync 3 APIM will work but will need to be programmed).  I found guy that will do remote APIM programming (search FB for Dan's Ford / Lincoln Programming Modifications)

* I found an OEM Sync3 Hub on ebay for $55

I'm ordering the GPS antenna and the Gen1 hub adapter from 4dtech (the gen1 adapters won't be in stock for another week or so).

By the time I'm done I will have spent right around $1000 to do it WITH Navigation.  Worth it to me since a quality headunit with Navigation, Carplay and android auto would run almost that in another vehicle and this will be completely factory.

Not to mention anything I can get for my Sync 2 setup will offset the cost of this. 
________________________________________________

I'm in the same boat as you (2013 F-150 Platinum), I'm so close to pulling the trigger but the $2100 ($1499 + 600 for Navigation) price tag is a LOT.   I really want Android Auto in my vehicle but not sure this is worth it.   I'd like to keep Navigation in the vehicle since it already has it.

I do see people selling the SYNC2 system they pulled out on eBay for about $500-600 which would offset the navigation.

I have found the APIM module on eBay:
$299 w/o Nav
$599 with Nav

The screen for $399

The media hub (usb) module for $57.95

The GPS antenna runs about $10

APIM to screen connector: $64.99

The only thing I cant find is the media plug wiring adapter

So you can do it yourself for close to $1000 less but I don't know where to find that adapter which is obviously what you'd need to hook up your phone...








Used for power.  I use them on my Side by side for the light bar, lighted whips and several other things.  they are generally just used when you don't want to permanently wire something together.
the K150kit is for cars that do NOT have Sync and just have a little 4.3 inch screen for the radio, cd and a few other things. 

On the Fords with Sync 2/3 it controls everything from interior lighting, navigation, diagnostics and more.

There really isn't any aftermarket replacement for this system other than a different OEM part.
Sorry but no.
My step-daughter's mom (and my wife) died suddenly in December of 2015.   She recently graduated high school with an advanced and honors diploma.   I'm trying to raise funds to allow her to stay in the dorms for at least the first year.  Thank you for your time.
So what toy(s) are you hauling in there?  RZR? Bikes?
If there is a RZR in that toyhauler then it's my father-in-law and would make sense since they live in Southern Utah and were on their way back from California.
That reads like a press release.  As of today, no alcohol distributors have passed qualifications to distribute. Until that happens OR the state allows other entities to distribute, it's in a holding pattern.

Although I have a feeling the state will rule today to allow companies like blackbird to start distributing WITHOUT an alcohol distributor.
In Nevada where recreational became legal on Jan 1st and dispensaries could start selling on July 1st it's been great.   Except for the MASSIVE fact that the law was written so alcohol distributors get the exclusive right to transport between growers and dispensaries for the first 18 months.     Of course, come July 1st none of the distributors are ready, ones that thought they were have filed incomplete applications or won't allow the state to perform an inspection.

Worse - this affects both recreation and medical cannabis. 

Fortunately there is a provision in the law that states that if there is no way to distribute then someone else can step in to distribute which will be ruled on today.

It's a shit show, you walk into the dispensaries after just a week and they are already running out of product.  

It will be interesting since alcohol distributors are regulated federally and of course, marijuana is still illegal on a federal level...
CDs are still digital music, just a different storage medium.

Here is a reasonable solution that will work with any Mac/PC and any device that will run the plex client.

* Purchase a Dell T20 on Amazon - http://a.co/exnNzOV
* Install Unraid Basic on it https://lime-technology.com/pricing/
* Install docker for Plex on unraid server

Installing Unraid is a no-brainer as you just write an image to a flash drive.
Once the machine is running you assign the hard drive to the system
You then install the Plex docker which is a pre-built package ready to run on your server

The processor in that server is more than adequate to stream several streams and even transcode multiple streams.

You can add storage as you need to.

If the spark is being flown recreationally, it does not need to be registered (for now)
You can google for a good chunk of answers but I will tell you that MoCA 2.0 is more expensive but has better throughput, less latency and in my experience, very reliable.    I used MoCA 2.0 in my house to connect an upstairs ethernet network to a downstairs without rewiring.   The other downside to MoCA is that if you use Dish/DirecTV with 'whole house viewing' then MoCA won't work with it (or it can but can be a total mess). It usually works fine with cable tv.

Personally I used these actiontec adapters and they've been rock solid:  http://a.co/c5NgsDS


I don't see Apple not opening up watch faces for customization soon.   Android Wear and Tizen watches feature it and it's very cool.
OK, so I went to Walmart and there were maybe 2 SD cards on the shelf, it looked like someone cleared them out.

HOWEVER, I asked and they had several baskets behind the counter which had the 128GB cards in them.  Bought 4 at $13/each for Retropie, Switch and my kids underwater camera.
yeah?
Thank you, that's exactly what it is.  Funny because 'Versa Hatchback' is a little different than the actual Note.  This most definitely looks like the Note.
Wow! Thank you!!!
I thought it was a Fiesta, Focus or some kind of Prius but not sure..
I'm happy for you :)

I put money into RTTR long term because they do have a product that shows promise along with preliminary FDA approval.  This wasn't a penny stock when I started with it and I've averaged down along the way.  

I have a Schwab account where I keep my 'real' money.   The 6k in Robinhood is for making smaller riskier investments that won't break the bank.
I sold what I had of AMD at a peak which was nice.

Bought AGTC and RTTR, long on both
Got RTTR at a hair under 1 and I've been riding it downhill ever since.   AGTC as well but it's stayed pretty flat.
Mainly RTTR and AGTC

When backing up with a trailer I try and explain it to people this way:

Put your hand on the BOTTOM of the steering wheel and then turn the wheel the direction you want the trailer to go.  

Sounds like you already have the hang of it though.  Really nice setup y ou have there.

I 'purchased' a jetpack with unlimited data plan on eBay last year.   I used it as my primary source of internet for several months before going with cable in a new house.   I paid $120/mo for it and never got throttled or anything.

The current Taurus would be the platform a 2018 Interceptor car would be based on.
I do but the app would make the less tech savvy users in my family happy.
If it includes Google Music that would be great.  It's convenient having YTRed and having Google Music as well.
Having locals included is going to help people who don't want to install an antenna but want to cut the cord which is huge.  I have a tablo and hdhomerun along with PSVUE but I'd be really tempted to swap VUE for this if it has the locals and most of the same channels.
SA is just a large popular site.  Virtually anyone can make a blog post and if it gains any traction it can do the kind of 'damage' it did to CETX.

Shit, it's not even real articles.  Some tool over at SeekingAlpha (god I hate that site) posted a negative article on $CETX that dropped the shares down to about $3.40.  I bought at $3.59, the next day I sold at $4.10 and it's normalized since then.  Not huge but I made a couple bucks. 
I home you're watching your $AMD stock now.  at 14.37 at the time of this post. 
I'm looking forward to seeing what OEM PC adoption looks like.  With AMD bringing similar performance to Intel at a much lower cost I think this will work well in their favor.  As long as Ryzen performs as well as AMD claims it does, this could be a good thing.  
Hindsight is 20/20

I still think $AMD is worth holding onto but keep an eye on them like a hawk.   There is some talk about AMD licensing GPU tech to Intel but there is no compelling reason for Intel to switch to them at this time (Intel has access to Nvidia's current portfolio of tech for the next 20 years regardless of agreement).   Also, if Ryzen sales flop then there is going to be a decent impact on value.

Thank you, I appreciate the post.
Most of the time it's the dealer that puts those nice holes in your front bumper on cars, not the manufacturer.
Real Estate in several major market areas slowed down *along* with pricing going down in Q4'16. Unemployment is on a slight uptick and demand for gas going down?

I don't expect a dramatic recession we just went through but I fully think people have a lot of caution with the Trump administration.
I applaud the idea and good work on it.  Personally I'd rather spend a little bit more and use a ProClip or Panavise setup and not mess with airflow, etc.
I'm just kinda proud of myself for *really* getting PersonalCapital and YNAB set up these past few weeks where I can actually use them and keep a better eye on what's happening with my money, investments and assets.
When I had AT&T FTTP I had the cable plugged directly into my router, bypassing AT&Ts gatway product.  AT&T Ethernet over Fiber doesn't need a modem of any kind, just a router.
If you have true AT&T FTTH/FTTP (you should have a box in your house somewhere with a battery backup and the actual fiber) then it's just ethernet over fiber and you can take the ethernet cable and plug it into your router.  You don't need to use their 2wire gateway product.  
Thank you.  For whatever reason, until I read this post I thought the Tablo was just another STB.  After researching it I think I'd rather use a Tablo than my HDHR + Plex.  Very cool

There isn't AndroidTV support yet?  I would love to swap my HDHR out for a Tablo.
Thanks!
That's not a glock, not sure WTF it is though.

Edit: Kind of looks like S&W markings and almost an M&P but not sure
Valid questions in here.  I was able to use my school email address that still works after a few years.  

I paid 107.00 for 4 WEMO switches.  The $7 was for tax.  $25/ea is pretty good IMHO which is why I posted it here.

You could either fabricate something yourself (some wiring, spade terminals, etc) or just buy a wiring harness for your vehicle.
10 years old and still better than a LOT of OEM stuff out there.  I've been looking at a 2017 RAM and at 65K the ****ing thing still can't mirror a display and do android auto.
Correct, told me I needed a minimum $2100 balance to continue.

This is the automated verification call.

I ported the number from AT&T to Verizon a few weeks ago.

All other calls are working normally.

Note that the call does come in and shows in the call log but then shows up immediately as missed.   No wifi calling (this is the unlocked version of the S7 Edge and does not have the verizon firmware/bloatware)
I would BUT with the same phone number and same phone this WASN'T happening on AT&T.
I don't have unlimited data, I'm on the L plan.
Is the VZW firmware that bloated?  Wondering if I should just stick with my stock U firmware and use Google Voice or YouMail.
Yep, I've talked to friends who were just told to go home.   If you're not being a jackass and heading to a trail you should be fine.  Carry your insurance with you.
I used to drive from the Cyan neighborhood over to that gate down from Damonte Ranch Drive.   I never had an issue and cops saw me multiple times.  I too have that sticker (the one with the stars around it).

1. Drive under 35mph (even if PSL is above that)
2. Use arm signals to turn
3. Obey all traffic laws.

You should be fine.  Out in Spanish Springs I drive my RZR to the gas station and to get food all the time - LOL.
Nice setup man!

Saw the picture and it looks like South Reno.  I just moved out of my house down there and got a new house in Spanish Springs so I can ride right from my house.

Let me know if you want to go ride sometime!

Looks like you can get $100 credit if you choose a different samsung phone.

Why not?  Look into it, the situation is almost identical to Samsung because the goddamn Polaris RZRs catch fire and kill people which is why they told people to stop driving them. 

Then Polaris comes out with a newer model for 2017 that fixes all the 2016 issues.   It's almost identical to the Samsung issue except on a much more expensive scale.

Polaris is trying to make good on it by giving people:  1) 12 months more warranty  2) $250 in accessories 3) $1000 off a new purchase.    Am I happy with this? F**k no. But I have to be realistic in what the manufacturer is willing to do.   At least in the case of the Note 7 you'll get your money back most likely.  I'm stuck with a $25,000 lemon.
I agree you deserve something, 100%.  I just think a free phone of your choice isn't realistic.

Unfortunately you will have to see how Samsung handles this.  If I had to guess, here is how it will go down:

1. Full refunds for all Note 7 purchasers and accessories
2. Replacement with S7/Edge + Accessories
3. Gift Card/Prepaid Cards from Samsung

Most people are going to go with #1 because Samsung isn't exactly a customer-service-first company.
Replace the phone, yes.   Give you your money back and a free phone? Only if you happen to have a phone that actually caught fire.   If you're phone hasn't caught fire you've been merely inconvenienced.  If your phone has caught fire then yes, Samsung should help you out in some way.

I own a $25000 Polaris RZR Turbo that they put a recall on in late July that said I can't use or ride it, I'm still waiting to get it fixed and it's the middle of October.  If my unit burnt to the ground it would be one thing but it didn't.  Is it an inconvenience and does it suck? Yes.  Do I deserve a FREE one because of it? No.
I sell my old phone on craigslist and buy whatever looks good to me after that.
I'm surprised to hear this.  One thing I like about Samsung Pay is the fact that I can use it with almost any card reader, not just the new ones that work with Apple pay.  I was out high in the sierra nevadas and found a bar, they had a credit card machine that still dialed in.  He told me the balance, I held my S7E up to the credit card machine and he was floored when the transaction went through.  

This was with an international S7 that I had to install UAE firmware on so I could use samsung pay.  I now have a US unlocked S7 that takes all that pain away.

I've never had a problem with Samsung pay.

On the flagship status I agree, but for me I tend to swap phones once a year so it's a non issue.


Speaker died on front, camera died.  HTC covered both.  I loved that phone though.
I'd argue that you never really owned any flagship android phones.  Don't get me wrong, the Z5 was a nice phone but.. meh.

I went from a Apple 6S Plus to an S7 Edge and holy crap.  Samsung Pay (not Android Pay) > Apple Pay in almost every way.   So much nicer to hold the phone in the hand, build quality is amazing.  Battery life was much improved and as far as the software experience, I can't go back to iOS, you are just far to limited on what you can do.   

Just for clarification, this is the phones I've been through.  I've been heavy on Apple for years and finally this year switched to Android (and got rid of my Macbook Pro and switched to a Surface Pro 4).

I sold my S7 Edge (Exynos) yesterday because I couldn't use it on Republic or Google-Fi.

I just pre-ordered the 128GB White XL but I'm not entirely sure it's going to be worth it.  Wondering if I would have been better served and saved some coin with the 6P.     Money isn't an issue but I'm not thrilled with the lack of waterproofness and the price after I added protection and tax was considerably more than the S7 Edge.

Check your local laws. 

I'm able to drive my RZR Turbo on streets legally because of the type of registration I have (large ATV that holds at least 2 people and has a bed) as well as the fact that I have full insurance on it, seatbelts, headlight and tail lights and brake lights.  I have to use arms as turning signals and can't go on any major road or freeway.   I do it all the time especially when I need gas, so much easier to drive it down to the gas station instead of filling up gas cans.

In my county I do have to stay below 35mph when driving on any streets.
I'll take this, even if it's comparing a year old version of the browser.  I've tried to use edge and even with Extensions it's still 'rough' when using Lastpass which I use extensively.
They've said it will NOT be a skinny package.   Don't expect anything special in terms of pricing.

Idiot. He meant the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953.
Sorry about the circumstances but as a former Jeep owner (8 of them) and current Ford Owner, it will be better in the long run.
I think the problem is that they WEREN'T high as fuck.
Personally about the only thing I miss is iMessage but not enough to keep me there.   

iOS has the 'out of the box' experience slightly better because you can't change anything about iOS.  However for someone like me I like to be able to customize everything.

iOS and the iPhone have become pretty stale IMHO.   I also have an Apple Watch but have decided to sell it as I just ended up missing my old-fashioned watch.


I came from a 6S Plus and absolutely love it.  This isn't my first move to Android, I previously did it with the HTC One M8.

Outside of the customization that Android allows you, 3 of my favorite things about this phone:

- Waterproof without a case
- Samsung Pay (not Android Pay)
- Smaller footprint on same sized phone
This is very true and there are some big risks with renting.  My thoughts were that someone paying $2000/mo in this area in Rent wouldn't trash a place but like you said, you don't know and it can be a lot of lost income.
Thank you! I have to admit that I'm in love with it.  I'm so happy each time I look down and see it. 
I'm not entirely sure it would work since the phone would detect you are in the UK (GPS wise) which is not a country Samsung Pay has been rolled out yet.   This method works in the US because we have Samsung Pay here.
If you look at your NV Energy bill over the past 12 months you'll notice that they conveniently lowered their rates to make the NVPUC decision look even sweeter.
How do you plan on dealing with inspections and appraisals?

How are you planning on making money?  Many states will consider the fact that you are helping facilitate the process as a company that you are representing the client.    Are you planning on simply being a referral network?

Are you planning on ONLY dealing with transactions that involve a unrepresented buyer AND an unrepresented seller?    If I'm a seller, what are you doing to expose my home to potential buyers OUTSIDE of your website?

Thanks!!
Like a jackass I updated the Pay app on my international 935FD that was running the XSG firmware.  Looks like Samsung hasn't put out new XSG firmware yet - any other countries firmware I should look at to use Samsung Pay in the US on AT&T?
They'll request the equipment/boxes back depending on the age of the equipment. They won't say anything about the dishes and They'll tell you to toss anything not current and just return the access card(s).
*sigh* This is just clickbait to the Younity blog.  
I'm assuming you guys have no real plans to actually bring this to the consumer market and are expecting (praying?) to be purchased by a larger vendor.

*Your price point is where very few people who can afford it would be the ones to install it.*    

If someone is spending $10K+ on a Home Automation system, they're going to have someone else install it.  In that case do you go with a proven system or something that is essentially a NL hack on top of other vendors systems?  Most are going to choose proven.

I hope you don't think I'm trying to crap on your product, I just question the validity of the business plan for this and question how fast you're burning through VC and early bird cash.




While the Excursion hasn't been around for years, you can (somewhat easily) interchange body panels and parts between 99-16 Superduties and Excursions.

Here's a 2003 Excursion with a 2012 front end:  https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b5/a8/14/b5a814468acc37bf8f12680427c3c3d9.jpg

Here's a 2003 Superduty with a 2013 front end:  http://www.powerstroke.org/forum/99-03-7-3l-general-discussion/845042-newbie-my-2003-f250-2013-front-conversion.html

Say whatever you want but 2017 is the first time Ford has actually made a significant change to the body outside of the front end and tailgate since 99.   You can mount a 2016 F-250 driver door to a 2000 F-250.
I'm aware but it shared the same body style from the front seats forward with the 99-16 Super Duties.
As much as I loved the current Super Duties and Excursion, I'm SO glad to see a body style change.  I'm loving this.
The international version works fine with Samsung Pay.   I have a 935FD that works great with it.
A word of warning that 805lm is not very bright at all.  These are great accessory lights.  
I don't benefit off this is any way, shape or form.

Contact Amber at RealtyBlvd in Reno - (775) 622-1445 or www.realtyblvd.net.    They're one of the few places in Reno that actually help renters looking for homes.
So I noticed that they offer the car hotspots under the unlimited plan.   I'm wondering if I can take a OBDII-to-usb and have it give enough power to the AT&T adapter to have a mobile hotspot. I know it seems lame but it just may work.
Well, banks like Wells Fargo have a completely separate bank that higher net worth individuals use like "Wells Fargo Private Bank".  

Same goes for almost all other banks and credit cards.  There are obvious ones like AmEx Centurion/Black and then you have whatever cards these banks want to issue that aren't available to standard civilians. 

Things from people that will run errands for you, purchasing services, etc, limo/driver services, airline tickets, etc. All without paying a single time (except that they're making money on your money). 

Almost everything becomes cheaper or free mainly because people expect you to spend more money with their business so you end up getting more for less (or nothing).  It's not just regular businesses either, the amount of perks that come with having some specific credit cards, bank accounts, etc is crazy if you're a high net-worth individual.

Just an update to this, I ended up buying a:

2007 Four Winds (Thor) Hurricane 34N on a Workhorse Chassis with a 8.1L V8.  Fortunately the previous owner did most of the upgrades available.  Coach has 29K miles on it.
I've experienced this before, both with my late wife and now a woman I'm exclusively dating as of this weekend.    Generally it happens with someone you connect on a deeper level with (don't confuse this with 'love').  You want something bad and any small thing can throw doubt into the situation.   

If you are officially bf/gf then I would think she is in fact, into you.   It's hard but try not to over analyze these situations.
I had no problems whatsoever with the lenses I had for my 5N - they're e-mount afterall.  The kit lens that came with the a6300 is much more preferable than the 18-55 that came with the 5N
I'd refer to them as candid photos.  It's fairly important to show a shot with your whole body.   Ad a friend of mine used to say, people can be "car hot"  meaning you see their head through a car window but once they get out...    What I mean is that people should see you as a whole - EVEN if you're not skinny or fit. 
Holy shit. I had no idea until now that I can fold my seats forward.
> I know I'm not going to have an easy time, I'm nerdy, kind of overweight (but making great progress here at least), horrible with women, and very certainly not highly attractive.

This shit is the reason you're struggling.  Gain some self confidence.  Get a haircut, get a new wardrobe. Post new pictures. Stop the self doubt.

What /u/youngmarshall said.  Why are you going out to dinner on a first date?

Coffee, drinks, juice bar (if they don't drink).    Generally I'm not taking someone out to dinner unless there is mutual interest in one another and that usually takes at least 1 or 2 'simple' dates before.
I'm 37, overweight, I have 3 kids and 4 dogs.

I got on Tinder 2 weeks ago, have had well over 40 matches and have gone on at least a dozen dates.   I've found someone I'm seriously interested in now and she feels the same way.  Almost all these women that I matched with were very attractive (sorry if that sounds shallow, but it's reality)

Physical attraction is important, especially on apps like Tinder and Bumble.  If you haven't - get a haircut, get some new clothes and post a new profile picture.  I made a post about this on here yesterday.

And get a little more self confidence.  Thinking someone better looking is going to come along and swoop your date away is ridiculous.    Self confidence or lack thereof will ooze out your personality and be an instant turn off.
I know where you're coming from.

/u/crazyjames1224 is correct about changing a facet of your life.

Long story short my wife passed away last year.  I didn't change my look or anything until about 2 weeks .  I signed up on Match, Tinder and some others a few weeks ago and got almost no response save for some people that I am not physically attracted to at all.

I get haircuts ever 4 weeks and go to a salon - I decided to tell my hairdresser to do something drastic and whatever is in style.

I chopped a bunch of hair off and started styled it differently.   I then went to Macys, searched out an attractive sales associate and asked her to give me her opinion on some clothes, shirts, etc.

The next day I had a few new pictures taken of me and replaced the old ones. 

All of a sudden I'm getting winks and dates on match, matches and dates on Tinder and Bumble.    I've gone out on numerous dates with attractive women and now have one serious woman that I'm really into.

It does make a difference and the reality is that people need to by physically attracted to one another in some way.

I'm a little chubby but I wear it well and with some style changes it made a massive difference.   At an older age women are also going to search out other items than just looks.  Financial and emotional stability are also important at 'this' age.
Keep in mind that I'm old (37) but can chime in here.

When I was 20 I had a long term relationship (3 years) with a girl that was 4 years younger than I was.   We had already known each other for a few years before dating.

I also have 2 16 year old daughters so I can chime in from that perspective too.

- Teenage girls have no idea what they want.  Protip: 20-something girls aren't that much better.
- Girls tend to make a transformation between middle school and high school.  Even if she's the oldest 8th grader she's still got a LOT of maturing to do.
- Once you're out of high school it's going to be a little awkward at some social and school events.  Most people won't care, some will consider you creepy, etc.
- When you hit 17 it's probably statutory rape in your state. 

Just some things to keep in mind.   Personally after that relationship I have never had a meaningful relationship with a woman younger than me.  Girlfriends and my late wife were all older than me.
If you're legally a CCW holder, it should be the first thing out of your mouth, *EVEN* if you don't have your weapon on you.

If it's not the first thing out of your mouth then you're an idiot because as soon as they run your name, they're going to find out you that you have a CCW and question why you didn't say anything.

That said I've never been frisked however when I get pulled over it's first thing out of my mouth.  Most of the time they know by the time the approach the car that they are dealing with a CCW holder.  If they don't they'll know after they run my ID.  It's not worth 'spooking' them by not saying anything.

You need more upvotes.  I agree this is exactly what is going on.
I read this and think that frankly it's a completely normal thing to happen.

Obviously you guys are physically attracted to each other.  I'd stop focusing on the idea of whether or not you're going to have sex.  You most likely will but let it happen when it happens.
Kind of funny that people assume I mean to whomever you're pursuing.  No, I mean fill your time with other commitments so you literally aren't available all the time.  She's not going to be available all the time.  Being available all the time gives you entirely too much time to hyper focus on having the relationship.   Continue living your life as you normally would. 
Stop focusing on it so much.  Stop looking for 'the one' and start looking for friends instead.  You'll be surprised how much easier it is to meet women that can turn into dates when you're not coming across as wanting to immediately get with them.  Don't make yourself available all the time either.  
All I can tell you is that I was married to a woman that was 15 years older than me since I was 25 (I'm 37 now).  She passed away this past year but we were very happy.  She had the same reservations at first but we took it a little slow and she got more comfortable.   Don't suffocate, don't be overbearing, telling her you love her even 2 months in may be a little much.
I totally get where you're coming from.  It's funny because today she's following up with me but frankly I've lost interest.  I think this may be a shitty game she wants to play to be in control.  

Incidentally since i wrote this post I did meet someone who I really clicked with and the whole encounter was much more natural than this girl.

Yes, but VOIP devices experience a pause the same time I get a time out.

THANK YOU /u/maddnes & /u/soucy

First I deleted my QoS rules. No change.

Then I deleted the jive firwall ruleset - the issue went away.

(I've also deleted the default user).

I've enabled a smartqueue as well as ipv4 offload. What do I need to do next to make sure my VoIP devices will work properly?  Sorry, I'm not that familiar with the edgemax products. I appreciate your help!
Ahh.. the UK, where even shitty Camaro's are cool.  I miss living there.
Sweet!  Where did you get it?
Everything matches up on the paperwork.  The guy wrote it up with pricing for a lower tier model.
They sold it to me for about $1000 less than the highest volume and lowest priced dealer in the US.    I made them firmly understand that I was throwing them a bone to do anything at all.
The salesperson did write it up with the pricing for a different unit.  However all the paperwork references the correct VIN and model information.    It was a very simple sales form because it was all cash.  They had no recourse but we still met in the middle because I was able to use it as a bargaining chip to get more.
It was a simple sales agreement since it was a cash purchase.  They had nothing they could do.  They agreed to eat it.
Update:  I went down there and they agreed it was their mistake, however I had some other work that needed to be done to the unit and wanted an extended warranty. They agreed and I wrote them a check for $1000.   I made them aware that I didn't have to do anything and that they could pound dirt.   

Even the highest volume (and lowest price) dealer in the US wants $1000 more for what they sold it to me at.  
Damn!  A better ride with Fox shocks and I can level out the front of the truck?  Yes please!    Who did you have install it?
Let me know.  The only thing I've done so far is install a Bakflip G2 tonneau cover on it.
I like that idea.  What kind of rear shocks?
I came from a 6.8L V10 in my Excursion and then a 4.8L V8 in the BMW.   I was NOT expecting the performance I get from this engine.  The only thing I don't like is the turbo lag but it's not that often I need it.   I am impressed by the power but the MPG isn't any better than the BMW V8 and only slightly better than the Excursion.
2013 F-150 Platinum 4x4 with the 3.5L ecoboost.

After having an Excursion for a few years, then a BMW X5 for the past 6 months I decided to go back to a Ford and have always loved the F-150.    It was between the Limited and the Platinum but what I don't like about the Limited is the red interior that was in all the local ones as well as the 22" wheels.  20" on the Platinum I can work with because at least there is enough rubber between the road and the wheel for a decent ride and protection against curbing.

Has pretty much every option available that I'm aware of.  I just installed a Bakflip G2 tonneau cover last night.   The next thing I need to do is get a leveling kit and get rid of the rake.
I went down to the dealership that is selling it to check it out.  A few things stand out:

The hood doesn't perfectly line up with the front fender
The driver door makes a creaking noise when opened
Sunroof rails are damaged

The truck has been sitting at their dealership for almost a year.  They passed me off to 4 different sales people while I was there even after offering to pay cash if they made me a deal.  They were asking $39k which they thought was a GREAT deal (lol!)

Wasn't worth me pursuing this truck when there are a hundred more just like it 
Thought it was interesting that the airbag as replaced and then not that much later 'moulding' was replaced.    I thought perhaps it was being driven as a dealer car, someone damages it, they fix it in-house and then list it for sale.  It's been sitting on their lot for almost a year so either they paid WAY too much at auction or they simply don't negotiate at all.

I think RobinHood is a great platform for people to start their trading experience on. 

* Trades carry no fees
* No minimum deposits
* App is fairly intuitive and easy to use

Thanks for this, made a few bucks on UPL today.
Christ, I thought being 3000 in line would be soon enough - this guy is in the top 30 and hasn't received an invite?  Methinks this is bullshit.
From a financial standpoint I feel fantastic.  I am completely out of consumer debt other than my house payment.

I eradicated all my credit card debt. ($38000)
I eradicated all my IRS debt ($8000)
I eradicated all car payments ($60k - 2 cars + travel trailer)
I eradicated all student loan payments ($18000)

My credit score at all 3 bureaus is above 800 and I got a chase sapphire to celebrate (50k miles after spending 4k - I've set it up to pay the balance off each month).

For the first time in my life I have a decent net worth at around $500K.   I actually have a financial planner now and Wells Fargo doesn't treat me like piece of shit.

How I got here sucks, but at least financially I finally feel unburdened.   Now I have to keep making sure I make sound decisions.
Wow. I'd seriously consider getting rid of my X5 for this.
It drives me nuts that people somehow think the management of the land in NV is somehow broken.  As someone who loves taking his ATVs out in Nevada I have to say that it would be a lot less fun without the BLM managed land.  Thats the great thing about it, you, me and almost anyone can use the land without worry.

Turn the management over to the state of Nevada and I guarantee you'll see almost all of it get sold off privately.  Good initially for state  coffers but bad in every other way.
I'm not going to downvote you.   I'm not even going to bother with the PPI now.  I looked at their reviews online and they only have 2 stars with 25 reviews.  Not good.  Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
CreditKarma = not an actual FICO score any lender would base a decision off of.

* My Equifax score on CreditCarma: 732

Every lender reports at different times.  Some report once a month, some multiple times per month, even several times per week.  Within a 30 day period of you paying down/off a debt you should see it reflected within your report.

Depending on utilization change it can be a large number. I've seen my score go up 30 points just paying off one card that was at about 90% utilization.
Yeah, it's so freaking random how it comes in waves and hits you at odd times.   Sorry to hear about your loss too.
Thank you, that's what I'm hoping!  I picked up a couple of used blasters for my daughters too se we'll be ATVing fools.
Don't be.  The only reason I can afford this is because my wife passed away.  I'd rather have my wife than the RZR but that isn't realistic so this is my pre-mid-life crisis solution.
I haven't been to Sand Mountain in over 10 years.  A lot has changed since you now have to pay for a pass, etc.   I'm staying in a friends motorhome who has a sandrail.   There aren't exactly that many places to camp out there and probably not too many spectra orange turbos so I'm sure we'll see each other.  
ER MAH GERD.   Hell yeah, hit me up.   Where are you located, looks like South Meadows area?
Oh thank god, I thought you got rid of the Retro!
x2 - I've purchased a BUNCH of items via Amazon Warehouse Deals and they've been great (and save serious $$)
I just bought my first ATV this past weekend.  2016 RZR Turbo.  $22495 + tax.  I justified it because I fortunately had the money and if I paid cash it came with a 2 year warranty instead of a 6 month.  Plus I know that nobody thrashed it before me.    I also have 2 Yamaha Blasters en route today for my daughters - a 2003 and a 2006 Limited for $3000 including trail tires and paddles.

Now I'm looking to replace my current vehicle with a used F-250/350 and replace my retro little travel trailer with a toy hauler to haul all this stuff.   I figure by the end of this year I'll have invested about $60,000 in this 'hobby'
Looks like the little guy just had a bad day and wants to take out some frustrations.
I've got some aluminum lower doors on order.

My FIL found this guy about 5 miles from him that can make me a roof in Spectra orange to match:  http://www.ksl.com/index.php?nid=218&ad=38432257&cat=518&s_cid=rss-classifieds-518

So freaking excited!  Headed out to Sand Mountain, NV this weekend!
While this may be against the popular opinion, IMHO use this to get through what you need to get through and then do yourself a favor and get off it.  Frankly start taking it soon so you develop a certain tolerance to it and you're not just falling asleep in class.
Not xanax but I've taken 1mg Lorazepam (ativan) for about 2 years every night to sleep.    Yes, you will go through withdrawls so you really want to taper off.  But I ^think ^^I'm ^^^doing ^^^^ok.

I had actually tapered off in the middle of 2015 but then my wife died in December and I've had to go back to it to get through the night.

IMHO I'd much rather be on ativan than xanax but that's me personally.  Xanax tended to 'knock me out' whereas Ativan allowed me to function without panic.
Socialized Housing is depressing AF.
And where do they make staff park?  Behind the hospital and across the street.  

My wife died in their hospital in December, did that stop them calling her cell phone the days after asking her to pay the bills?  Nope.
1:20 you keep your bikes in your living room?!
Homekit plays too much into Apples closed eco-system.  Don't get me wrong, my house has nothing but iPhones, I have an apple watch, several apple tvs and macbooks.

The reality is that SmartThings is open to connecting hardware from multiple manufacturers regardless of platform.  I can control my Hue bulbs right along with my leviton switches and Wink bulbs. 

SmartThings wasn't always owned by Samsung - thank god, because if it did it would go down the exact same path as HomeKit where it can only be controlled by iOS devices.

When I started looking at home automation I knew I needed to find a hub first and the products I wanted to hook up to it second.  Because of that all my stuff works with SmartThings.    You're in an opposite situation where the items you already have control what hub you'll need to get.  

It's just my two cents.  I also prefer the new smartthings hub because it can still control items offline (unlike v1 smartthings hub and Wink).


Meh, I have a wink hub sitting in the box.  I got it when I first got into HA and then quickly got a SmartThings Hub and then A SmartThings hub 2.  Wink is just too limited IMHO and all my Wink devices work fine with ST.
Nope. It's someones attempt at making it look like a Raptor with the grille but there are several things off:

* Grille
* Fenders
* Non-stock front bumper with LED light bar
* Side steps not OEM
* Body colored door handles (this is a lariat, platinum or limited)

Probably more I'm missing.
Gen 1 Raptors are going to drop like a rock.  Now is the time to sell because you can't buy one brand new.

People won't care about not being able to get the 6.2 if they're getting similar power from a different powertrain.   Most Raptors I see aren't used for what they were made for, they're driven around because it was the highest option available and had a limited production run.    I'll tell you right now you're going to be able to pick up a Gen 1 raptor for 60% of what they are selling for now come the end of this year.
After my wife passed away suddenly on December 13th, last night was the first night I've slept without taking a combination of ambien/xanax or ambien/ativan.     Wasn't the greatest night of sleep but felt good to not depend on it one night and to start to wean myself off regular usage.   My bedroom was probably in the low 60s and I woke up sweating so my body sure noticed a difference.

During the day I'm on fluoxetine which I don't know how I'd be doing without it.   Fortunately my wife got me to start taking it a couple years ago after a big panic attack.
Here is the rest of the pictures:

Other than the Red X5 that has the hood on it, the others are just front fascias that were probably built using aftermarket parts. 
My wife died about a month ago, leaving me with our 3 children (they were from her previous marriage but I've been in their life 12 years and they consider me dad)  Be strong but make sure you take the time to grieve and deal with it.  You're going to have bad days, horrible days and OK days. It's going to hit you at weird times.  There is no getting over it.   I know how you feel and I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
Thank you.
She passed over a month ago and I have 3 teenagers to raise and bills to pay.  
My wife passed a month ago.  Better words have never been said.  You do only live once. Thank you.

Auto Insurance
You are fine.  My wife had life insurance but nothing amazing.  It will cover the cost of her death and hopefully any and all personal debt. Not looking forward to student loans as I was the guarantor on most of them.
This is what i know on that subject.

I should NOT adopt the children at this point with them being so close to legal adults.  By simply being the legal guardian I have most parental rights that I need without losing the financial obligation.  AFAIK if I truly were to adopt the kids as my own the obligation from the bio-dad would change.
He does pay consistently and does wish for the children to remain with me.   I'm 99.9% sure the thought of having the children come live with him scares the shit out of he and his current wife.   I've raised these kids for the past 12 years and it would be wrong on every level except financially for me to 'turn them over' at this point. 

There was a GoFundMe set up right after my wife passed. It's raised about $6k so far but I'm expecting most of that to go towards handling probate expenses (my wives LW&T was written before we were married and NV is a community property state).  I don't dare spend a penny of it until I know where I stand.
In a way it would have been worth it.  Not financially. But worth it.
You must not own a V8.
Having dealt with Yesco I would expect nothing less for the large sums of money that were paid for these signs.

Weed, like alcohol, has a diminishing return the more you use it.

We're also wired differently.   Some people can quit things like cigarettes and drinking cold turkey, others can't.  Some can regulate the intake of said items and others can't.

When any of these substances take over other parts of your life or make you start feeling regret about other parts of your life then it's a warning sign to get your house in order.

When I was young (I'm 37 now) I would go to parties and drink just to get drunk.   Now I'm much pickier about what I drink and make sure I enjoy it.  Sure, I'll get a buzz but I don't feel a requirement to get shitfaced.  

You can have a happy and successful life and still leave things like this involved, just exercising moderation and self control.  

The fact that you are acknowledging is already a huge step in the right direction.

My wife died a week ago and I go between happy to see them and completely and utterly depressed and sad.  I'm on reddit when I'm sad.
I like BMWs and from the front seats forward this is a great looking car but the sheer amount of different vehicles BMW is pushing out makes it seem like they've lost their way and the 'soul' of BMW is fragmented.    There are some cars you buy and you can't stop looking back when you walk away from it.  Then there is something like this where I'd look back at it and just think "fuck." to myself.
Thank you and I am taking your advice. Sometimes I need it, sometimes I don't.  Certainly when it comes to sleep I need it.

Thank you for your kind words.
wow. just, wow. Your response has helped me so much. Thank you, THANK YOU!
The backstory behind this picture is even more interesting:

I think you should reconsider your answer.
That is a 2017 Audi A4 Allroad.

http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1026218_2017-audi-a4-allroad-spy-shots#image=100531089

The Avant isn't to be released in the US, we get the Allroad instead.


Finally.  My house has ATT fiber but its limited to 45Mbit so I went with the 120Mbit charter.     I can't wait for the upgrade especially since Gigapower is synchronous.
The OP could NOT return the tires if they were below minimum tread depth without getting charged for them.

BMW is going to charge you for tires below X depth regardless.     Lets say you take off the RFTs and put on some regular cheaper tires.   Before you return the vehicle you throw the OEM tires on and you won't pay BMW a dime for tires.

The ONLY thing I could think of is if they charge a flat fee for tires vs. actual cost that could be cheaper than RFTs.
You could always take off the OEM tires right away and replace them with something cheaper.  Then at the end of your lease put the originals back on.
Surprised they aren't wrapped.
It's not worth buying.

Not sure why you're being downvoted as I've seen on various forums that alignment can be a big cause of thees issues.
The rears on my E70 are 315/25R20 - pretty low profile.  Unfortunately in that size there are only a few options.
I agree.  I actually can't wait to get it back. Those 12 days I had it got me hooked!

I hear you there but whenever I drive it, it makes me happy.
Correct and I have 3rd row anyways.   I'll put non-rfts on there and use a compressor/slime kit along with AAA gold.
Gas mileage doesn't bother me.  I used to have a V10 Excursion as my daily driver (9MPG city, 7 towing).

IMHO if you get into a V8 X5 they are pretty nimble equipped correctly.

That said I hadn't considered an X3.  As my DD and I do some light towing, it may be a better buy down the road vs. another X5.


After originally picking her up I took it to about 150 while overlooking Donner Lake in California.  It was amazing (thank god for radar detectors).
That's just a regular ol' 3 series touring.
Thats the bad part - I paid a local indy shop over the phone to check it out.  They did a shit job obviously and I reversed the charges.   Dealership says they took it for a few hours but clearly they didn't do much of anything (check for a CEL and done? lol?)
Thanks for the heads up.  Incidentally it would be awesome if I could make my car do this wirelessly via the Carly app =P
Thank you!!
Yeah, that's what I've discovered. That's fine with me and a small price to pay.  Per my request they're putting on Conti DSW-06's instead of the Bridgestone RFTs.  Can't wait.    They were probably happy I said I was OK with a cheaper tire - LOL.
HIGH FIVE TO USED BMW OWNERSHIP!!! =P

Glad to hear your situation worked out!
I really want to get an X5M next but since I'll probably let common sense prevail I'll probably just get a 2014 35i w/ M-Sport package
320i
Picked up '08 4.8i X5. Liked it because it had great maintenance records, looks like new inside and out. Had the comfort package, premium package, sport package (w/ 20" 214 wheels), technology package as well as factory tow hitch (I have a lil 2500 lb travel trailer).

Everything was peachy until I went to put my license plates on and I saw oil leaking.  Scheduled appointment with dealer (out of state) and in the mean time I took to a friend who is a great tech at the local BMW dealer.   They came back to me with the following issues:

* Replace timing cover gaskets (leaking)
* Replace valve cover gaskets (leaking)
* Replace power steering rack (active steering) (leaking)
* Replace AC evaporator (leaking) - I thought this was a 'normal' smell (lol?)
* Replace battery (I was aware before)
* Replace microfilter housings (cracked - I was aware before)
* Replace all four tires (rears looked great on the outside but were showing belts on the inside (staggered 20"ers)

I had a 3 month / 3000 mile power train warranty on the vehicle.

I notified the out of state dealer before I went down there. They said they'd take care of the engine leaks but not to hold my breath about the rest

About a week later they call me and tell me they got approval to replace EVERYTHING listed.

The dealer is taking care of everything above and gave me a 2015 loaner to boot

I was aware of the ongoing cost of a used N62 vehicle would be high - I am extremely glad they took care of me.  I'll only hold on to this for 2 years before replacing and the Valve Stem seals had been replaced by the prior owner so hopefully not too much will happen over the next 24 months.

Oh and I'll buy another used BMW after this - but it'll be a CPO this time :)
Good friend of mine who has several BMWs and Porsches - when I look between a used Cayenne S and used X5 I liked the look of the X5 more.  Then I drove both and it was no comparison.   The X5 with active steering, adaptive drive and everything else was night and day.   Did my research, knew it wouldn't be a cheap vehicle to own and that these issues would come up.  Fortunately for me most of them came up right when I bought it and when it was still under warranty.  Then the dealer even stepped up and went beyond that.
Yes, a good part of me thinks I should just thank my lucky stars that the dealership did the right thing and took care of me.
For a BMW, the engine issues, yes (reasonable).  The others - including tires were not (the tires were showing the belts on the inside) and steering that was malfunctioning.

Thank you for replying.  I do want the car and I agree the dealer is being extremely reasonable.  My only fear with with the vehicle now is waiting for the other shoe to drop - what will happen next since I no longer feel that it's reliable.
As a N62 owner those additional 4 cylinders scare the shit out of me and my wallet.
IANAL but was also sued for defamation from a Yelp review for about the same amount.   Finding a lawyer decently versed in SLAPP law can be difficult however it's not a terribly difficult job for the lawyer to do as really you just need to do is file a dismissal based on that it is a SLAPP suit.     My research found that most(not all) of the time the yelp reviewer 'won' in that the case was dismissed.  I'm not sure about CA but in NV if the court rules it as a SLAPP suit WITH prejudice then the plaintiff is automatically hit with a $10K fine.  In my case it was ruled without prejudice and then I removed the review after the fact. Fortunately my laywer took it pro-bono.

CHeck out this site:  http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/anti-slapp-law-california

It was a HUGE help when we first got notice of the suit.
You could have a 3rd party code your X to disable the TPMS.  Not ideal but if it's driving you nuts....

Your biggest hurdle is the dealerships inability to reproduce the issue.  I'd probably either whip out your phone when it comes on or even go as far as mounting a GoPro to your car to video the problem.  You've spent $100k+ on the car so this may be worth it.  With video evidence you'll have a lot more pull with the dealership and with BMWNA.

If they can't fix this on the 3rd try you have the option to exercise your rights under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.  Sounds crazy for a TPMS related issue but it may be worth it.  HOWEVER since the dealership can't reproduce the issue I don't know how far you'd be able to go with this.
I'm also going to chime in here.  The X5 really is just a BIG car vs. a SUV and when you drive it compared to a Mercedes ML/GLK, Audi Q5/7, Grand Cherokee, XC90, etc it handles SOOO much better.  On mine I have adaptive drive along with the sport package (staggered wheels) and when I'm making turns at high speed.   OH. MY. GOD.    I figure in about 2 years I'll pick up an X5M and can't wait.
Congrats! I just bought one too but it's been in the shop longer than I've owned it!!

What engine in there?  Please tell me the 4.8.

Looks kinda like 3.0 on the side there.  Sigh - was hoping you'd get to find out the joys of the magnificent N62B48.
I'm actually surprised that auto check showed something Carfax didn't.  Did you drive it to Arizona too?  
Holy crap - you should have run a CarFax on this vehicle

Looks like it was stolen in Ohio shortly after it was purchased in 2000 and then was in an accident that apparently caused the vehicle to catch fire.  No airbags deployed however.

It appears to have been in 2 major accidents.  1 airbags were deployed, the second was so bad the car was considered a total loss.  Looks like it was a salvage title and then retitled.

Also in 2008 there was an odometer discrepency and it looks like that continued.  Based on the CarFax data your car has somewhere around 295,000 miles on it.

Here's the Carfax:  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/611601/2001%20BMW%20325CI_%20WBABN33431JW50007.pdf

Minor accident.  Lack of info in the carfax report may indicate a lack of maintenance but take take that with a grain of salt.  Like any used car and ESPECIALLY BMW it's worth it to get a PPI/Pre-Purchase Inspection.
I hate people trying to screw other people out of their money.  In your price range there are a lot of shady people out there polishing turds :(
You can run the license plate against CarFax.

Take the info with a grain of salt but it's interesting that nothing has been reported re: maintenance for almost a year and a half after the owner was taking it to BMW Houston.  This is most likely because the service was covered with the original purchase and then they either didn't want to keep paying for it after that plan expired or they are taking it to a independent shop.  I'd get the PPI as mentioned by another user here.

Find a locksmith that can program BMWs and have them cut the key and program the fob. Alternatively if you have a second fob you can use it to program this one and then only have the key cut and coded.
Not really, Same generation X5.   BMW may have 'fixed' any issues that popped up in 2014.
I'm thinking you meant 2011 32**8**i and yes, for ~$13k that is below market value if it's in good mechanical and cosmetic condition.  Does it have any kind of warranty?
Bought a used BMW X5 in Rocklin, CA.  Came with a warranty and there were some issues to get fixed.   Original dealer wanted to fix vs. having Bill Pearce do the work and I was ok with since they'd give me the loaner.  It's a nice car (2015 Mercedes CLA250) but just driving it over the hill this past Wednesday when there was rain on Donner was a 'different' experience.

Edit:  Turns out after some google-fu that the CLA250 is actually a FWD vehicle.  That would explain the spirited handling in the rain over the pass, I was feeling the rear end moving - not the front.  I have slightly more faith in the vehicle on the valley floor but hopefully it doesn't dump in the mountains.
No, just no.

I had to take my vehicle in for service in Rocklin and am driving a stupid bright red rear wheel drive mercedes that can barely handle rain let alone snow.   If we get all this snow I will probably die in the red bitch trying to get over the pass to get my car back :(
I find this oddly awesome.
Height wouldn't have been an issue in the Cabrio but winters would be :)


I just recently purchased my first BMW. And it's a V8.  I knew for me it wouldn't be a cheap endeavor to get into - HOWEVER:

1. Get a PPI
2. Buy from someplace that at least provides some kind of basic warranty for the first ~90 days.  This is twofold to me: a.) the dealership is willing to stand behind the car mechanically and b.) you have some protection if something major goes wrong.
3.  Find the best independent shop in town and don't go to the BMW dealership (unless there is no good shop in town - which would suck). 
4. There are a TON of BMW owner forums out there - they will prove to be an invaluable resource.
Actually M^3 45
It's a nice vehicle but a couple of things bother me for what they're asking:

It has Alpina wheels - that doesn't make it an Alpina vehicle, someone needs to rip the Alpina label off (at least they used the badge from the same era)

The butchering of the door panels for the speakers.

The head unit.

The cheap paint job.

Hopefully whomever buys it restores it back to more original condition.
Nice to see more X5 owners representing here!
Is there any extended warranty remaining on the vehicle?  BMW V8s aren't cheap to maintain and repair.

X5 fit the bill.  SUV ≠ Off roading
Congrats and welcome to the X5 club!
 
For some reason a lot of people here dislike the X5 - I love driving mine.
You shouldn't own a BMW if you're not familiar with a check engine light.
Seriously - they couldn't get their shit together enough to RELEASE THE SHOES on OCT 21, 2015?    It's not like they had TWENTY SIX FUCKING YEARS to get prepared.
Heads gaskets, vale stem seals have already been replaced.
I also picked one up today, I also changed from DirecTV to Charter today as well.  All in all I'm very happy as this device gets much closer to replicating the D* experience than Charters box ever could.
This is the worst post I've seen all day and it's only 11:11AM PDT.  Thanks Reddit.
Glad to see this.  In terms of the body it's more or less been the same truck since 1999.
Apple is also a massive retailer and doesn't sell Chromecasts or Fire TVs in their stores or online.  

I'm sorry but I fail to see this as a big deal.  Anyone who does a large amount of transactions or sells to Amazon knows they do crappy stuff  behind the scenes. If you are a 3rd party and one of your items is selling really well - guess what, Amazon will start selling that item directly and cut you out.
 iPhone 6S Plus running iOS 9.1 PB2.  If I'm playing through the iPhone speakers then I get a short pause and a few clicks.  If I'm playing through my big jambox the music pauses.
I installed a Zalman CNPS5X onto my Apple Watch and haven't had anymore overheating issues.
Buy the iPhone though Apple with the upgrade program.  Sell your 6 to pay the balance of Next and have the cash to put down for the iPhone upgrade program (you do pay for Applecare up front).  Now you have the phone you want and aren't tied to AT&T forever.
Am I the only person to wonder if this is from a gold Macbook? 
I had the SGS originally but worried too much about scratching the face with all that I do.  I loved the look of the black.

I returned it a few days later and got the SS, I wasn't thrilled about the 'chrome' of the SS but did like the sapphire face.   The next day Apple decided to release the SBSS for the same price so I returned my SS and got that.  I love it, it's the best of both worlds, I have a black watch with a sapphire face. 
This year I just got a reservation so I can walk in at 8AM and get the phone.  If you'd like to get it in the phone but not wait this is the way to go. 

If you're NOT in a big city and are open to size/color I would be really surprised if there is ZERO stock in the afternoon.   Sometimes it's crap like a 16GB Sprint 6S+.  HOWEVER, with the new Apple iPhone financing their phone will work with any provider so they may sell more of em.

Or do what my wife does, wait 30 days with your current phone, walk in and buy whatever size and color you want :P

Before the WATCH I had:

* Jawbone UP
* Pebble Time
* Pebble Steel
* Garmin Vivosmart
* Garmin Vivoactive

Nothing really compares to the usability and look of the Apple Watch.  Its the only one of the devices I can wear with anything and doesn't look like a toy strapped to my wrist.  The e-ink displays in the pebble and garmin vivoactive while great for sunlight, suck in every other way.  

The only thing the Vivoactive had on the apple watch is completely customizable faces.  I'm hoping these come soon.
Yeah, this will my first black phone since the iPhone 4.  Glad to be away from white.
What brand?
The difference between this and AT&T Next 12 is not being tied down to AT&T.  AT&T Next 12 will still yield you a AT&T locked phone.   I've been with AT&T for cell phone service for 18 (!!) years.  I'm ready to move on.
Considering my reservation says to be at the Apple store at 0800 on the 25th, they'll have phones.
Don't forget a few visual items:

* San Francisco font used throughout
* Siri is now the colorful waveforms instead of just the lines
* Now playing screen has easier buttons for shuffle, etc.
Didn't see one in the box. However I did just grab it out and slap it on.
Here's my story.  About a month ago I picked up the SSML.  I returned it a few days later thinking it was rediculous that I purchased an apple watch.

Fast forward to last Thursday. I walked in and got the SGS BSB, after labor day weekend of babying it beause I was afraid I'd scratching it I went in and got the SS BSB on Tuesday.  Then yesterday I see that you can get the SB-SS for the same price. So I went back to the store today and got it.  It looks so good I don't care that I can't polish the scratches out :P
Jesus.  Last Thursday I got SGS but returned it on Tuesday to get the SSBS. Now I have to go back to get this.  Does apple have a limit on how many times you can exchange an item?
Either through the Apple store app or on Apple.com.  Sometimes a screwup causes the pre-order to come a day early if by mail (although usually not).  You can also pick up in the store the morning of if you JUST CANT WAIT until UPS/FedEx delivers.
I'd preorder directly from Apple then.  There is no 'cheapest' option.
This plan since you can switch carriers at your choosing. AT&T next is still a AT&T locked phone until the balance is paid in full.
yep!

$150,000 RV comes with craptacular head unit :(
On a lot of import items / 3rd party seller items - Amazon is the ONLY place selling the item.
Did you find it?
Yes, the clerk didn't know any better.  On top of that Garmin does Unilateral retail pricing so the movers coupon shouldn't have worked but they did a manual override to give me the discount!
Check family plan.  Family will supercede the indivudual plan - you won't be billed for both.

source: did this same thing.
eh.  Olivier is just another tahoe boutique broker.  Hell, their website isn't even completely done yet and they've been around for a few years.   Not to mention in the Tahoe area you can do a few transactions to be in the 'hundreds of millions' volume zone.   They're also the same exact model as any other brokerage.

Zenly also isn't a huge change over anything else that isn't already out there.

As the technology and looks to these keep changing I seriously am considering dumping my 4000NEX and just going with an Android head unit.   While I use CarPlay all the time there is still the reality that my iPhone has to be present.   


Why not use one of them as a NAS running something like Unraid and then something else for the HTPC.
Didn't you read the BIG RED BOX on he right side of the page, labeled: RULES ?
I had the mount-n-lock (it was originally 4 square or something like that) on my old 33ft trailer.  It did the job but the bumper did still twist slightly and frankly all the bouncing caused all kinds of stuff with the bikes.  On the back of a trailer they really bounce around.  I quite frankly think the bumper is the LAST place to put the bikes if you can do a rack on your vehicle, front of the trailer, etc.
There is something about that body style that looks freakin' awesome with lift + big tires.   
I had something like this happen at a private campground.  The campground just ended up charging them for another day.   They came back to their RV at about 4PM drunk off their asses, proceeded to hook up and drive off :(
Are these MSDN keys? Will they stop working?

I've purchased from discount tires a few times (the one in S. Reno) and can tell you that they will beat TireRack pricing if you ask.  I just put BFG AT KO2s on and out the door it was cheaper than TireRack for just the 4 tires.

Applefy, Stamp and even Apples own Beats import did a craptacular job of bringing over my playlists. They'd either match a cover of the correct song or something completely different. My best solution was just just spend a couple hours on 2 screens finding the right song and readding it.  Sucks but at least everything came over correctly.
As someone that did this accidentally building my first Pi a few days ago, I just ended up refreshing the card and starting over again.  
I'd just like to say that you really don't need a kit.  I built my first Raspberry Pi a few days ago and preferred to source different parts because the Canakits seemed a little cheap.  You may spend a little more but it's worth it.  I used the Zebra case which is solid once assembled and I also purchased a high speed 32GB Sandisk card so that I'd have plenty of (fast) storage.




Saw the thumbnail and thought it was an Excursion. Clicked on it and was not disappointed.

Nice ride - awesome color.

Any modern trailer winterized correctly should withstand your winters.    How many people?  You are going to want something light which may be something like an R-Pod or similar depending on if it's just you or family as well.


Ermahgerd yes.

33'er weighed just under 8000lbs when we were travelling (6500lbs dry weight).

New trailer weighs 2500lbs dry and I'd put it at about 3100 with our stuff in there.

I've always used a BlueOx Swaypro Weight distributing hitch w/ sway control.  With the 33er on the back of my excursion along with Firestone airbags at 25psi it was stable 95% of the time but in major winds there could be some white knuckling.  Also, pulling that extra weight kept me staying at ~55mph to be comfortable.  The tounge weight on that sucker was just under 1200lbs.

When we got the new trailer I considered just getting an anti-sway bar and attaching it and selling my SwayPro.  I ended up installing that WDH on the new trailer and it is night and day.  Honestly I forget there is a trailer attached to my truck unless I look in the mirror.  I have zero sway regardless of conditions, I can easily pass other vehicles and accelerate up hill.  I can keep my speed between 65-70mph on open flat areas. It's night and day.

Obviously more RV spots are open to me now because of the smaller trailer.  We tend to ONLY go to rustic campsites (no parking lot style parks) where there can be some great but small sites that we now fit into.

NOW - backing it up is a different story.  My 33er was a dual axle and was fairly easy to back in because you could afford to do hard deliberate turns and it wouldn't make a big difference.  Although we've only had the new trailer a few weeks it takes some time getting used to how quickly the trailer will turn.  Rather than gradually go into the turn it almost does it instantly.  It's hard to say.  It isn't difficult, it's just different.   If you are looking at a 24' it may be dual axle in which case my statements above are a moot point.

The biggest thing for us was realizing we really didn't need all the space we thought we did. So much of our time is outside the trailer and that 33er gave me an excuse to carry WAY to much stuff.
Thanks.  MPG savings, transmission savings, stress savings.  It's all much better!
We absolutely love it.  Now that our kids are teenagers and driving they have zero interest in being in the trailer with us which is why we downsized.   We originally looked at the Shata airflyte reissue but they were plagued with issues from the factory and the Retros have more modern amenities.

Ours did not come with a radio and I'm not sure where they'd put it?  I'm ok with it because our 33er had speakers on the outside and I rarely used them because they didn't sound great and they blared sound way past our campsite.  Now we just use our Jambox.
You can use a transformer to step the 220v down to 110v.
Fortunately my wife work pays for it - It's $1125/mo for the 300GB plan.
AFAIK Fiat Chrysler has not announced any of their North American brand models that will have CarPlay just yet.   The only thing I'm aware of from them is the Ferrari.    

It won't be as simple as a firmware update on existing hardware.

Dealerships will be probably the last to know.  They have no real connection to the manufacturer other than selling the vehicles on their sign.

I'd recommend considering a 3rd party head unit if you must have CarPlay.  IMHO It's nice but not a 'need to have' yet.   Especially until Apple allows more apps to have CarPlay compatibility.
Watch this.  You most likely need to change the settings from USB to HDMI.

Who dictates what is wasteful or not?  A firefighter and most of the public would argue that they are not a waste of taxpayer resources but if that firefighter is making $200,000/yr some would say it is wasteful.  Also, if you're reducing tax burdens, you are reducing the money that would go towards that firefighters salary.
Newer Pioneer units want to see a ground signal twice which is why just grounding it does not work.     You can build a relay but they end up being quite large.  I found it easier just to order this:

http://amzn.com/B00A9AQPUU
You CAN mirror almost anything on your phone (some apps will not allow you to use a 'second screen') using HDMI.  You just have to control it via your phone.  This video is correct.
Thank you!
HDMI is only going to get you screen mirroring with NO touch control without the Pioneer app and limit you to the apps that Pioneer supports if you do have the app. 

At one point there was a jailbreak tweak known as AppRadio extensions which allowed full control of an iPhone from the headunit but it has been abandoned.

There is an app called Ignition that you can install on jailbroken phones. It will show a CarPlay interface on your phone, which would show up on your headunit, but you won't have touch control.

I wish there was a way to do both at the same time, frankly.  I use an app called DashCommand all the time that works great in AppRadio mode but not in CarPlay.

McNeil racing does make a Raptor grille for 92-96 bronco which should fit right on your F-250.  
http://www.mcneilracinginc.com/raptor-fiberglass/

They have some other parts too that *may* work: http://www.mcneilracinginc.com/off-road-fiberglass/ford/bronco/1992-1996-bronco/

Fortunately until 96 all the light/medium duty F series trucks shared the same fascia (97 for f250 & f350).   Most cosmetic parts from the Bronco, F150, F250, F350 and F450 should all work.   This will open up your options for parts massively.

Personally I think you'll have the best luck on eBay since you can get both aftermarket and NOS (New Old Stock) parts on there. 


This right here.  If CAI did what people think, manufacturers would be putting them on from the factory.    

On 99.9% of vehicles, simply replace your standard air filter on a timely basis and you'll get the exact same performance gains as a K&N.  Plus you won't be allowing larger particles to enter your engine and you get the satisfaction of not throwing your money away.
Yes, confirmed with manufacturer that it has the lift installed. This was important to us since we like to be at rustic campsites vs trailer parks.
Awesome - thank you.  We are so excited to dump the big trailer since it's just my wife and I now.  Absolutely love the Whitewaters.  We got turned on to the whole retro trailer thing when we saw a Shasta '61 reissue at a campsite but discovered that they have their own fair share of issues and don't have as many of the modern conveniences.
I can't give you enough uproots! I'm picking up that trailer ('16 177 SE to be specific) on Sunday!  Trading in our 33'er for it.  How do you like it?
Looks good - would rather see a glossy black front end though.

Thank you.

As someone with intermittent exotropia in their 30s (I've had it since birth) I was under the belief until very recently that my ONLY option was surgery.  After a post hit the front page last week with the poster having strabismus I commented about getting surgery and was corrected that vision therapy has come a long way and surgery is not the only answer.   Your post has helped me a great deal in comprehending what I need to do as well as finding a local optometrist to help with my vision therapy.

Just wanted to let you know that your post is very much appreciated.
Awesome! As someone in their 30s with extropia (but fortunately 20/20 vision) this gives me hope.  I used a patch for months with no results. 

Thank you!!!
I know I'm late to the game but are you willing to share the name of your Doctor?
The earlier you correct this the better the chances it won't be an issue for her later in life.
Essentially if you're above the age of 16 you're at a point where surgery is your only option.  Glasses and patch treatment won't do anything once you're older.
Most of us are aware, just look at whichever eye you want.  We don't care.  For the most part I will concentrate to focus both eyes on someone when we are talking face to face but at home, etc. I know it happens far more often.

Next time you feel 'weird' about it - realize the wonderful social stigma that comes with having a 'lazy eye' for that other person.
Its based off original MSRP when purchased new and then depreciation. because of this you will just keep paying the same amount after the 9th year.  I'm not a huge fan because my vehicle is 13 years old and still costs almost $300 to register.

Because I'm referring to the experience within CarPlay?  I'm simply stating my experience with this setup.  I didn't post that there were any improvements within 8.4 - just that I enjoy the Apple Music app along with CarPlay and Siri. I think you're confusing this thread with the 'no updates to carplay in 8.4' thread?
Very good points :(

I've always felt that CarPlay is currently Apples red headed stepchild until it gains more traction.
I wasn't being specific to 8.4 and improvements to CarPlay.  Just that now it's a much more streamlined experience.   I just get in my vehicle, plug my phone in and I'm completely done.
Weird :(  When I installed the latest Beats and opened it up, it said I had an account and asked if I'd like to import my playlists.  Have you created a beats account?  It's possible that once you install the update and you HAVEN'T created an account then this method will not work anymore.
I did it this way:

http://www.beatsimporter.com/

Imported by Spotify Playlist into Beats using the above site
Then the latest Beats iOS app will allow you to transfer your beats playlists to Apple music.
This just isn't correct.  Along with being able to access the Beats 1 radio station, if you search for songs that aren't in your library and subscribe to Apple Music you can play anything they have available.
Sure does, under "Radio"
So far the current DJ is annoying as hell.
You want that trailer to be level with your vehicle unless you want to induce more drag and definitely more sway.

Either look at a weight distributing hitch or at the very least, drop that hitch down an inch or whatever it takes to keep the trailer level with the vehicle.
Ahh, the sweet irony that the clerks name is 'Katie Lang'

She shares the same name as the Canadian singer....
I spend most of my time listening to Spotify, rather than watching it.
It's a crapshoot.  Ask them to breakdown and give you an explanation of all the charges and find out why they charged you so much more than their competition.
A couple things:

You have a couple options if you call renown:

1. Go on a payment plan, even $20/mo.  It shows willingness to pay and at least it doesn't go onto collections.
2. Ask them to reduce the cost if you pay the balance in cash.  This only works if you actually have the money (don't ask to pay less AND be on a payment plan)

I personally have done both of the above options.

Your other option is to:
1. Not pay them. It will eventually go to collections, it will be a derogatory hit to your credit.
HOWEVER
Most lenders no longer view medical collections as a big deal anymore.  You can still buy a new car, house, etc.  Unlike consumer debt and installment loan defaults, medical collections don't carry much weight.

Also, in the long haul and after the collection is no longer 'fresh' on your credit report you can try and dispute the charges.  

I did this twice and the collection company (remember it is no longer in Renowns hands) couldn't prove the debt was mine and it was removed.
is she.... shitting in the urinal?
Honest question: Why?

Don't get me wrong, the structure is nice to have for storage and shade but why put the trailer in there and set up?  Why not have it outside to enjoy?

Sitting on an enclosed concrete pad would kind of kill it for me.
Wifi. Bluetooth does not have enough bandwidth to do decent display mirroring (CarPlay is essentially showing a second screen from you iOS device).
No solid answers on that.  There has been supposed claims that the Alpine ilx-007 head unit has it but nobody has verified it and Alpine says nothing about it on their site.

Like /u/Cashmang said - it would be awesome to have a wireless dongle but Pioneer and Alpine are in the business of selling head units, not dongles :(
Thank you.  :(
I think this was several years ago. Not sure why they just posted it so recently.

Edit, yep - this was in 2009:  http://www.bbcamerica.com/top-gear/videos/u-s-road-trip-reno/
I assume you are stock trading?
Nice work.  Looks like new!
So what was it on your end?

* Dashcommand
* Google Maps
* SiriusXM (this will never happen)
Do you have a daily commute? If so, how long is it?
Is it the camera angle or does it really have such an 'underbite'?
Yep - SD's and Excursions '02 and after will wire right up and heat and power will work fine, the only thing that won't is the parking light and that's easy enough to tie in.
I still have them in storage.  IDK, I didn't love them and preferred the black and polished.   If I find a set of the 05 18" Harley Davidson Rims that fit the Excursion without adapters I'd probably go to that since I do like the idea of keeping everything factory.
Between 1999 and 2007 almost all the front fascia is interchangeable.

In my case I did the following:

- Found a 2006 Header Panel on a junkyard F250
- Found a 2007 F-350 Bumper, Bumper Pad and valance on craigslist
- Purchased '05 headlights, Purchased '07 Grille

Once you swap a 99-04 header panel out with the 05-07 then it's just bolt right on.

I did have the bumper pad (the part between the grille and the beta bumper) painted to match my truck.  The donor truck was a burgundy/red.

You can do the entire thing aftermarket via Fleabay but I did it almost all with OEM parts which made it easy.  Total I invested about $350 to do it which is a REALLY good deal.

It is really easy to do it yourself.
Visibility is so much better.  I tow a 33ft travel trailer and any extra visibility is a plus. 
Yep
Option 1:  Force encryption, only use private trackers and use a blocklist

Option 2: VPN + Option 1 (or not)

Open 3: Stop torrenting and seek alternatives (legal purchase, usenet, etc)

You didn't receive a demand letter and you haven't had suit filed against you.  You have simply received a cease and desist.  By removing the torrent from your client (and apparently removing your client) you have accomplished this.  No need for you and your father to freak out unless you keep doing the same thing without changing.

it'll buff out.
So now that we're all introduced and friends now, can we go out for a beer? :)

I've had both.  I've kept my Costco membership.  The only upside I found to Sams Club is that compared to costco it's like a ghost town in there.     This is personal opinion but I'll hold Costcos Kirkland brand in much higher value than the Sams Club store brand.

Please read this as I went through the same thing (except with Chrysler and a Jeep Grand Cherokee)

If a vehicle goes in for repair on the same item more than 3 times it's considered a Lemon under the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act.

Personally I got a lawyer that specializes in it and let them take care of it.   Chrysler didn't want to go to court so I got the option of  1) Vehicle buyback and my money back  or 2) Keep the vehicle with a cash settlement.     I actually ended up doing #2 and paying off the vehicle (I also fixed it myself (AC Blend doors)).

Trust me, if you can show proof with the paperwork that it's gone in multiple times for the same issue and it can't be fixed, it's time to get a lawyer and get this done.  Without legal representation you'll just get blown off by Ford (or any manufacturer for that matter)
That is a REALLY nice looking truck.
Audio Alchemy is still around and the name is a registered trademark.  For the most part you're most likely fine if it's just a local business but note that they could potentially come after you for trademark infringement.

TILF, actually.   Not me personally though.
If memory serves you should be fine EXCEPT you won't get on AT&T's LTE data network. You would be on their '4G' HSPA+ which isn't too bad at all.
Are you financing (contract or payment plan) the phone or buying it outright?

If you're financing it, wait.  Nothing worse than being stuck in a contract or making payments on an older phone.

If you're purchasing it outright then you can go either way.  Right now nobody knows if it's going to be a 6S Plus or the 7 or any other details.
Thank you for this response.  Just went through this with one of my kids - a single crack will get replaced under warranty. Anything more and it's AppleCare+.
Looks like a Westin Sportsman
Private trackers, Force encryption on your client and use a good blocklist.   You really don't have to use a VPN if you do a little work.
Beautiful - I'll always appreciate the design of that gen of Cruisers.  I've wanted one as a rig to work on.  Looks great, congrats!
My Excursion (which only has oversize tires) has been:

* Keyed twice
* Gum stuck to windshield
* Questioned why I need to drive such a large vehicle many times

What is irritating is the first 2 happened in parking lots where I parked AWAY from everyone and in a single space.

I find this news disturbing.   My wife was just sued for a Yelp review which was thankfully dismissed as a SLAPP suit.  I don't know what we would have done without this legislation.
Not a shabby way to get into Ford.   IMHO this is the best body styling the Mustang has had in a while.  Finally looking mean.
Seriously - nothing worse than seeing "lovestoshop69@yahoo.com".
That should be a move in the game.
Make sure you're licensed and bonded in case you screw up and get sued.
After reading up on it, it appears Japanese NEX units are locked to that language even if you flash it with firmware.   

You're best bet is trying that hack..

http://www.nex-hack.info/talks/
This may be stupid and obvious but have you tried flashing with English firmware?
Fair enough.

That monster wire DOES have the 'flux tube' inside of it.  Honestly if you take that out there isn't much difference - except for the price you paid for that Monster cable (it's ok, I know you'll come back and tell me it was for a friend).


You can find the part you need on eBay:  http://www.ebay.com/itm/FORD-OEM-09-14-F-150-Outside-Door-Handle-Left-CL3Z1522405AB-/331518055104?fits=Year%3A2012%7CModel%3AF-150&hash=item4d300412c0&vxp=mtr

Your issue will be that a) it needs to be painted and b) it needs to be installed.  Thats why it's $500 to fix it at a body shop (labor).  That said, if you're willing to do the work yourself you could do it for cheaper.

I take it you are not filing an insurance claim?  Or your deductible is higher?
I've driven large and small vehicles.  I always hate being behind a large vehicle that completely blocks my view.  I also realize I'm not driving a sports car so I pass on the left and then get right back over.  It's nothing special - it's just doing what a good and observant driver should.

The station switched to its current frequency and call sign in 1975 and became known on-air in 1979 as K-97, becoming an Edmonton favourite during the 1980s. In the mid-1980s, CIRK was broadcast crystal clear throughout North America as a secondary audio frequency on channel 18 of Canadian satellite Anik D. For many years, mornings were hosted by Bruce Kenyon.

> The station has a reputation of keeping long term talented announcers. Rob Berg since the early 1980s and Melissa Wright mid 1990s.
> 
> In 1997, the station was rebranded as K-Rock. In 1998, CIRK was purchased by Newcap Broadcasting, who already owned CKRA-FM and CFCW in the city. Through much of the next five years the station regained its success, however in the early part of 2007, the station has struggled in the ratings, with public firings of new and long time staff members.[2] CIRK had rebounded to be the 5th most listened to radio station in Edmonton.[3] As of July 7, 2008, the station returned to the old K-97 branding.

That's an uncrustable!
Yes, that is and I just scheduled an appointment but it's almost 2 weeks out.  Apparently my local BB is down to virtually nobody that is trained in anything outside of installing head units and speakers (which is where my expertise already is) so I have to take it to a best buy about 25 miles away.

I'll just take it in there and see what they say.  Kind of glad I had them do it now since at least the work is guaranteed.
This receipt is 6 years old.  Which is why the OP censored the date...

Pretty much.  Clearly nobody found my original comment remotely humorous :(
Meh, I get the same mileage with my 6.8L Excursion.
Consider modifying your diet and/or eating pattern to do this.

Consider having a few cups of coffee in the morning before your shower to help you shit as well.

Lastly, happy cake day!
6.8L V10.   Thanks  - I love the '08 style mirrors.
They are quieter than the absolutely craptacular Kelly Safaris they replaced and quieter than the original BFG ATs before that.
I do some photography but nothing remotely professional or close to it.

I do graphic design and marketing for my employer however and I don't know why people risk a lawsuit or settlement over a (almost always) cheap licensing fee.  We'll happily pay the licensing fee because it's **never** more expensive than a lawsuit.
Which GoPro?
In the past few weeks I've bought a couple NUCs

4th gen i5 NUC = died (CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED errors and then it simply wouldn't even turn on anymore)
4th gen Celeron NUC = horrible fan noise right out of the box. Awaiting RMA from Intel.

So far the quality of these things... sucks.
Yeah, it's unrealistic for an individual.

Now - T-Mobile offers unlimited data on phones and tablets - however that doesn't include tethering.  HOWEVER - if you flash a custom rom on to the phone you should have no problem enabling tethering regardless.  In reality it's a 'moral grey area' and a violation of the TOS however you'll find plenty of evidence of people doing it.
You'll want to call Verizon because I don't think you'd find it on their site.  It's because they have 100+ Verizon devices.  A 200GB plan will run $1400 on their website which is probably unrealistic for most individual users.

You may want to look at their stand alone LTE service. It's going to hard to find a lot of LTE data without paying $$$.
I share a 300GB plan with Verizon for the Mifi.  There have very few places I haven't been able to get service (usually just out in the boonies).

Fortunately the plan is through an employer who has lots of Verizon lines and the others I share the plan with never use it.    That said - I think if you can use the VZW Mifi and then find free wifi places you'll have a happy medium.   
Agreed - its a pretty small and specific userbase to troll though :)
Raymond has been hired by someone and/or is planning on creating a commercial version perhaps? 
Playon/Playlater works with HGTV as well.
FYI:  AppRadio mode uses HDMI and Bluetooth - not USB.
With CarPlay you can simply have a lightning cable from the back of the unit to the phone (or use a USB extension cable and plug the lightning cable into that)

With AppRadio you need HDMI and Bluetooth and therefore a [Digital AV Cable](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD826ZM/A/lightning-digital-av-adapter) (AppRadio mode does NOT use USB).  Most people will still run a usb cable because they're already doing wiring but it is not required.  Personally when I was using AppRadio mode I had a high output charger running to the breakout cable to charge my phone faster than what the head unit can do.   

I'm not a fan of how limited CarPlay is but AppRadio is mediocre at best.  Yes - you'll get a few more apps to work with it but I don't think the tradeoff is worth it.
I use a HDHomeRun Extend with a Netgear R7000 AC router and a Macbook Pro that has AC.  Works great.
Mother of god.  This has to be one of the best posts. Ever.
What is the fastest speeds AT&T can do for you? 45Mbps is their fastest tier right now which isn't too bad if you can get it.  If you're in a newer home (>2008) you're probably looking at decent speeds.

Cable however will almost always be faster than whatever the phone company is offering if they're just using old DSL.
I'm just getting started.

I'm getting rid of DirecTV which was $130/mo
Using an antenna, Prime and Netflix get TV so we'll be getting close to $100/mo in savings.
This works great with my HDHR Extend!
Some, not all shows unfortunately.
We need to do away with channels completely and go to just buying/streaming only the actual shows you want.    We are a ways from this ever happening.
I don't see a link to anything.

That said, what systems are you planning on emulating?  If you're getting into Wii/GC emulation then you don't want to go with AMD. 
Please tell me you didn't pay that much for it.   I got this and just had the local store price match the website (it was $24 at the store)

Honestly, if you've lived in a large metropolitan area you wouldn't complain about Reno at rush hour.  It takes oh, 5 minutes longer to get somewhere at 'rush hour' here.     When I lived in So. Cal it took me over an hour and a half to get form Coronado to Encinitas which are only 30 miles apart and that was on a major freeway.

It kills me that it's even called the spaghetti bowl considering it's basically just a modified clover leaf interchange (specifially a "Clover stack").   Google I5/CA-163 or the Pregerson interchange in LA.  THAT is a spaghetti bowl.


People were buying and selling homes completely based on speculation and easy credit - including sub prime.

This time around you don't have sub prime borrowers, it's considerably more difficult to get a home loan these days if you don't have good credit.  Are there people who are still going to buy based on speculation? Of course but not like we had before.  

You're also dealing with a different scenario in Reno. People and businesses are realizing the benefits of our location and amenities.  This time around we have a big influx of new businesses among other things.  

Markets will go up and down but for the most part what you're seeing right now is going to be the new 'normal' and is somewhat the (for lack of a better word) California-cation of the area.

One of Reno's biggest issues for anyone that works here is that the wage vs. cost of living is really off here.   It's not all that cheap to live in Reno and many employers pay like it is.

I guess we're getting closer to a la carte service.  You're still buying bundles of channels, including stuff you possibly don't want.  I feel like the only thing that is changing with these services (Sling, Vue) is the medium - instead of a dish or cable, it's simply transported over the internet.  
Take a look at [StreamNation](https://www.streamnation.com/), it would accomplish what you're trying to do and the free account would get you by if you're ripping dvds.
Build an Unraid 6 box.  Uses Docker to make adding programs like Sonarr, Sab, etc.  It runs of a USB drive and utilizes all the drives in your system (rather than using one for the OS).  The free version will do 3 drives (including parity) and you can mix and match whatever hard drives you want (your parity drives just needs to be the same size or bigger than your largest hard drive.
Have you tried http://www.canistream.it ?  You can filter by provider.

No problem installing on 14.2 here and it works great - thanks!
and/or SSL & Private trackers, forced encryption.
For dual booting Android on your PC - look at [Console OS](http://consoleos.com)

Honestly when it comes to the PC - you'll want a machine that is an i3 or i5 and pair it with a video card that isn't too noisy (for the HTPC side of things) but powerful enough to run the games you want.  $700 will go quite a ways at building you a great box or both.
Yep - they all do.   Most PVR apps out there will.  Heck - if you use Windows Media Center (free w/ Win7, addon for Windows 8) you don't need any additional software to play, record, etc and it works great with the HDHomeRuns.
This is great news.  It has some catching up to do (assuming Google didn't change anything about SageTV but just used the software to build their own) - especially with the Interface.

There are starting to be a lot of different options in this space for these products which is awesome.


You could look at using a HDHomeRun Prime which is about half the price of the Ceton card.

For software you could look at software like MediaPortal, NextPVR, MythTV.      
In my honest opinion using a HDHR Extend and then adding a Prime later is the best way to go.  For about $185 on Amazon you can pick up both of them used from Amazon Warehouse deals.
I'm all about an HTPC since I use one but it almost sounds like a TiVo Roamio would work for you.

https://www.tivo.com/shop/roamio#/roamio
I've been waiting for this announcement and as soon as I heard the pricing and the fact that it does NOT have a GPS chip in it (important for the sport model) I went ahead and ordered a $250 Garmin VivoActive.

Keep in mind I have an iPhone 6+, iPad, Macbook Pro, a couple AppleTVs... etc.    I was really hoping the Sport version would competed on the same level as other sports watches.
Thank you for turning me on to MediaPortal - I'm very impressed. 
What about something like:

http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/speaker-system-z906
Just bought a HDHomeRun Extend this past week and have been very happy with it - works great!
Honestly I'd recommend an AV Receiver.

That said, check that your current PC doesn't have onboard 5.1 surround.  If it doesn't you could pick up:

* [Creative Sound Blaster Audigy FX PCIe 5.1 Sound Card](http://amzn.com/B00EO6X4XG)
* [Logitech Surround Sound Speakers Z506](http://amzn.com/B003VAK1FA)

Obviously you can spend whatever you want on the speakers.  The above would be great on a budget.  Spend anymore and IMHO you should just get a receiver:

* [Denon 5.2 Channel AV Receiver With 4K Capability and Bluetooth](http://amzn.com/B00DS1QRQY) - $199

Considering how close you are to your towers:

Do you already have the RAM?  16GB is a waste if it is ONLY going to serve files.   If you plan on running any VMs on it, etc then it would be worth it.


"Reading these comments is hilarious"  - technologiq
I'd recommend:

Unraid for the server - the free version will get you started and you can just add hard drives as need be.    After using different products I really like unraid more than anything else out there.  You don't even need a monitor to set it up (if your pc is set to boot from usb first) just load it on a USB stick and go.

WMC or Plex for your HTPC.   XMBC is great but for ease of use you can't beat Plex.  You can run it on top of whatever OS you'd like.
Any US tuner card or something like the HDHomeRun would work for you as Jamaica uses NTSC.
Here are instructions to use OpenVPN on the Fire TV

https://vpntips.com/fire-tv-vpn-install/

I personally like PrivateInternetAccess but you can use anyone you'd like.
For sure, at least you know the worst case scenario.  It's going to cost me $300 to cancel my DirecTV service (I'm 6 months in to a 24 month agreement) but considering I won't be paying $130/mo I'm good after 3 months.
Time to call them up and ask - get the address of the place you're moving and the unit to know for sure.

Ask them what the ETF will be.   It may be cheaper just to pay the ETF than keep service with them (it will most likely be).     
AppRadio mode is specific to Pioneer only and essentially does the same thing but uses HDMI to mirror and bluetooth to communicate rather than everything over USB/Lightning  (App Radio mode doesn't use USB at all with an iPhone)

For the most part it does the same thing as Carplay (albeit buggier).  There are apps that support App Radio mode (like Waze, Dashcommand, Sygic and others) that aren't on CarPlay yet.    There really aren't that many AppRadio apps either.     

You'll also need a Lightning Digitial AV adapter to do AppRadio mode as well so it may not be worth it at all.   Unfortunately you can't simply switch back and forth between the two modes without changing some settings on the head unit.
In short.  No to both, for now at least.

In order for apps to work with Carplay they have to be developed with that second screen in mind.   Now, it's possible that an app developer has a carplay feature in the app but hasn't 'turned it on' so to speak but you'd have to know that app and then figure out a way to allow it on Carplay.

The closest thing we can hope for in relation to this is that something like AppRadio extensions (a jailbreak tweak for ios6) comes out for iOS 8 or 9 and allows for complete screen mirroring to carplay.

Frankly, you may find that using App Radio mode instead of CarPlay gets you more.  

When I was an Android user I have to say that the full screen mirroring with ARUR was Amazing, but sadly the lack of polish and frequent crashing with my HTC One M8 drove me back into the arms of Apple.
Are you 100% sure you are locked into a contract?   Are you receiving a promotional rate of some kind?  Most of the time U-verse doesn't have a contract.

If the place you move to can't do U-verse but CAN do DirecTV they may tell you that you are obligated to stay in contract.
Absolutely this. If only I could give more upvotes.
Where are you planning to mount the antenna?
Nicely done!
What vehicle are you using to tow the trailer?
Charter. 100Mbit. No cap
Do I have any need for a pre-amp?
Thank you!! This helps a lot.

I thought the HOA could still place restrictions on placement - which they can't as long as I abide by the FCC rules...  I'm going to have fun with this.

Thanks again - TRULY appreciated.
How would she threaten anything if she is in a coma?  She's lucky she got anything.
Everything from the driver/passenger seat forward in an Excursion is the same as a F-250 Super Duty from the same year (minus the leaf springs, the Excursion has softer and lower springs). 

It has the same engines (6.8L V10 Gasser, 7.3L and 6.0L V8 Diesel), same transmissions, same front and rear axles.

I understand where you're coming from as it is not a *pickup truck* but it is by definition, a truck.

(Yes, I own an Excursion :) 

I don't know why Ford didn't partner with a Tool company instead of a Toy company. 
Nice work and looks great.  This is the first non-screen double din that doesn't look like something from Fisher Price.
A few things:

You're going to have wires you won't be using on the harness - this is OK.

On that second plug it's used for a couple things:

Rear multi-CD  OR Rear DVD (if applicable)
Sound to headphone jack on center console (if applicable)
On the Excursions that also carried the sound for the rear speakers.  I don't know if that is going to be the case for you.



I'm sorry about your dog :(

I'm happy we're getting something - even if it is rain down here.  The ski resorts are getting a little snow which is good.  For a few days there I was wearing shorts and t-shirts to walk my dog and it almost felt like a Southern California winter with highs getting near 70.
The max tongue weight for your SUV is 600lbs.   Your tongue weight with that trailer is ~750lbs.  You're already exceeding the capacity of that Yukon.  With a weight distributing hitch your max tongue weight goes to 1000lbs (this is GMC's numbers FYI).

Also, your maximum payload is 1700lbs.  Subtract your tongue weight and you have about 900-1000lbs for all people in your car and all cargo.   

Anything over both payload and tongue capacity is exceeding what your vehicle is capable of and putting yourself, your family and anyone else on the road in danger.     You don't need to spend thousands on a Pro-Pride.  Look at something like a Blue Ox SwayPro or similar at least.   That vehicle NEEDS a Weight Distributing Hitch, regardless of your anecdotal evidence.
If you don't already have one, get a weight distributing hitch w/ anti-sway or sway elimination (don't cheap out here).  This is especially important since you're right at the max tongue weight for that Yukon and it has a short wheelbase.
There are 4 manufacturers that have built in iDataLink Maestro RR:

* Alpine
* Kenwood
* Pioneer
* Parrot

Only Alpine & Kenwood will do climate control options (parrots product is not released yet)

Problem is neither one of those manufacturers have a head unit that does CP/AA *and* has the version of Maestro you'll need for climate control.   That said, give it a few more months and something should be out.

I briefly did this with my Wii U using the HDMI and it looked decent (considering it's a 7' screen on the 4000NEX.

If you want to install one full time but use other sources then just use a HDMI port multiplier. Most use a 12V DC (vehicle) or 5V DC (USB) power source making it easy to hook up.
Holy crap.  These instructions were amazingly helpful.  I have gotten the 'master' switch up and running and they control the lights just fine.

I have the 'slave' switch installed but yet the switch does absolutely nothing to control the lights. The LEDs in the switch are lit but nothing happens when try to turn on/off or use the dimmer.

Any ideas?
Yes - a dev made a fully working control for the RGBW including color picker and dimmer.
Smart things can control the Fibaro RGBW controller without the need for the HomeCenter2
Here's the reasons why I'm not a fan (yet).  I love Carplay and I love Spotify so this is a major 'bummer'.

I'd say about half the time I fire up spotify from the head unit I get nothing. Just a black screen that doesn't list artists/songs/playlists, etc.  Sometimes plugging back in works.   I did find it to work better when I had the phone on airplane mode and the songs downloaded to my phone but that really defeats the concept of spotify.

Many times a song will fail to load and you'll just get dead air.

Now, if you control the interface from your phone itself it will probably work fine but now you're defeating the point of CarPlay.

I've posted this to the [Spotify forums and you can see there are quite a few other people with the same issues](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Help-iOS-iPhone-iPad-iPod-Touch/CarPlay-extremely-buggy/td-p/938289).

I've actually found my CarPlay music experience better by switching to the Music app on the iPhone and using iTunes Match for now.    I only pay $5/mo for spotify so it's not the end of the world but definitely frustrating.


FYI:  [SNES CD ended up becoming the Playstation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNES-CD)
I with most of these vendors would make a limited version of the font available.    The 'screenshots' they provide usually aren't at all in any layout remotely close to what I would be doing.
Your comment is true but it is a problem for them as the market as a whole is shrinking.   [Microsoft's share of that market is decreasing while Apples is gaining.](http://marketrealist.com/2014/04/macbook-pro-macbook-air-help-apple-gain-pc-market-share/)

Will it ever tip in Apples favor?  I don't know but it *is* a problem for Microsoft otherwise they wouldn't be pushing a new operating system out.



I've had the 8500BHS and the 4000NEX with both iPhone (6+) and Android (M8) devices.

I have to admit that Android + AppRadio Unchained Reloaded was the best combination since I was mirroring everything on my phone with the head unit.  Using tasker I was able to automate the whole experience.

Once I switched back to iOS I do like CarPlay but of course, you are very restricted in what you can run.  AppRadio mode is far from perfect but you can run other navigation apps.  I really like Sygic for GPS and you can use it with AppRadio mode.

The best thing would be if AppRadio Extensions was released for iOS8 but it looks like development on that tweak fizzled out when iOS7 was released.

I've said this before - I don't think we are going to see a huge amount of change in the CarPlay world until usage hits a critical mass.  Once more vehicles come stock with CarPlay and more aftermarket units are released at lower pricepoints then we'll see a lot more action.
I didn't realize you meant the Pandora mode on deck when you referenced that.

Honestly I wouldn't expect to see anything new in regards to CarPlay until you see a critical mass of vehicles with CarPlay on the road.  The market for CarPlay is so small right now I think both Apple and developers have it on the back burner.
What Stereo do you have.  With Pioneer and Alpine right now they have a 'Pandora' mode anyways making the need for it in CarPlay slightly less.
Congrats - most of it works OK. Spotify sucks though.
It depends on your timing.

Right now Costco has unbeatable prices if you buy Michelins.

If you have Amazon Prime then I've found Amazon to be cheaper than almost anywhere on many tires.

Lastly, of course there is Tirerack.  My biggest beef with Amazon and Tirerack is the ongoing difficulty of finding places who are willing to install tires you bought somewhere else.

It's a cold, just got to let it run its course.  If you are susceptible to upper respiratory issues (asthma, smoker, etc) then you're going to feel it much worse than someone who isn't.
For whatever reason Pioneer doesn't implement the iDataLink module that would allow the deck to control climate controls.  If you need that you're going to have to go to Alpine (or Parrot).

http://maestro.idatalink.com/compatible-radios/
So much of what people want - this head unit has a lot of promise.  The problem is two fold:

1. Parrot doesn't have the best head unit track record
2. Price.  I'd expect this to be around $1K

I assume they are using iDataMaestro to tie into other parts of the car which not every vehicle supports (climate control, etc).

Well, more competition can't hurt.
Keep in mind that you'll continue to burn slightly more calories during the day.  It may not be much but everything adds up.

In my opinion you're wasting your time (and money).  Pawn shops around here are all rip offs - usually asking full retail for used items.

Head online to Amazon or eBay.
In most cases, restoring an iPhone to original Apple software is going to remove your jailbreak and Apple won't be able to tell that it was jailbroken.
Personally I'd spend a few more bucks and do this:

* Clarion Mobile Electronics CZ CD/MP3/WMA Receiver : http://amzn.com/B006WVX9R2
* Rockford Fosgate Prime Full Range 3-Way Coaxial Speaker - Set of 2: http://amzn.com/B00BF6HVGY

I just figure if you're pulling your stock head unit out you might as well have bluetooth and other modern functions in it.

Heck, you'll probably see a good change in sound just switching the speakers out.  If they are the stock speakers in there they are cheap 16 year old cones.    To make the speaker install a snap, just use these:

* Metra 72-5600 Speaker Adapter for Select Ford Vehicles

The USB shold be in FAT or FAT32.

Fortunately the NEX series actually allow you to navigate folders so you can put them into a folder if you would like.
HomeKit won't be a product line.  It's an api to to control and manage home automation devices from a single interface (iOS and Siri).  There may be a hub involved but you're not going to see Apple making switches, relays, outlets, etc.
Any Head unit with HDMI in along with a Lighting to HDMI adapter.  The only problem with this is that some apps (especially navigation) will disable themselves upon discovering another screen is attached. 
I personally think there aren't enough customers out there for Apple to care about fixing current issues.  My experience is almost identical to your except I use Spotify and it's a crapshoot as to when it's going to work.

Now, that said - all the other features of CarPlay work great for me.  Using 'Hey Siri' makes it easy to navigate places with out typing anything in.

I will say that i unlock my phone right before I get in the car which usually saves me a step.  What I would really love is for paired devices like the iPhone and head unit to unlock at least the CarPlay features when the lightning cable is plugged in.
Hallelujah - I'm stoked on that RGBW light controller.  Wish it was cheaper than that but that controller + 32 feet of light strip is still cheaper than 6ft of Phillips FOH strip.

Edit:  I ordered a RGBW controller - I'll update when I receive/install it. (Wed 19th)

Edit 2:  [I don't like that your charge more for Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P1N68FW/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) :(  I understand it costs you more but I still don't like it.
I started out with a Wink Hub that got me sucked in but then I quickly realized UI is in its infancy and supported products is meh.    This weekend I swapped it out with a SmartThings hub and I'm on cloud nine.

I think it would be incredibly short sighted for Apple NOT to include Zigbee and Z-Wave compatibility in to their potential HA products but you never know.   

Google I'm not worried about at all with the takeover of Revolv.  

I've got a mixture of the following and it works great with ST:

* Phillips Hue Bulbs (wifi)
* GE Link Bulbs (Zigbee)
* Leviton Dimmer Switches (Z-Wave)
* Linear Relay for Fireplace (Z-Wave)
* WeMo Switch (wifi)

This will take time since you have to reverse engineer the 'handshake' that occurs between iPhone and head unit when you plug the compatible devices in.  CarPlay doesn't use HDMI and Bluetooth the way "AppRadio" mode does (CarPlay doesn't touch BT at all other than calls).    

That said I have a CarPlay headunit and a iPhone 6+ that I can jailbreak so if someone wants me to help figure this out I'd be happy to do so.

You're looking for a mountable omni-directional mic.  I think you're best to look at mics used for conferencing.    Something like this:  http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR-4697-Omnidirectional-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B002GR7INW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1415630867&sr=8-2&keywords=omnidirectional+condenser
Do you currently have 2 thermostats operating 2 different zones or 1 single thermostat for your entire home?   

Is this 'new' construction (built in the last 0-7 years)?


haha, no worries - maybe I'll be a chosen one!  For $99 it's worth a try (i hope)
Your link conveniently puts the user on the waiting list.  You may have wanted to link to http://www.amazon.com/oc/echo/
I'm trying to see how this is a deal?   Most if not all the devices at Staples cost MORE than anywhere else so IMHO you don't really get a 'free' hub since you're paying more for those other devices.  
In newer construction you have 4 wires

Live / Load (or switch wires) there are 2 of these - they can be either red or black

Ground wire - Sometimes green, sometimes bare.  Generally NOT required for most smart switchies

Neutral wire - Sometimes but not always white or grey.  Pretty much ALL smart switches require neutral.   Can NOT be substituted with ground

Edit: I found a good picture showing it: http://www.smarthome.com/images/2476dside3big.jpg


I thought about this but the problem with Link bulbs is that (for now) they require internet access to control.   If I lose internet the light is stuck on unless I get up there and unscrew it.   Other bulbs however this would work fine.
That's a good point.  These bulbs aren't a huge premium over dumb LEDs, might as well use them anyways.
All of this is public information.  I'm not sure why you'd want to attract more attention to yourself. I'm not going to bother linking to it, nor will I cast judgment but if your intention is, at this time, to not reveal any information about it, do understand it takes about 30 seconds of research to find all the information about this.
Who pays for return?  Them or myself?
Technically you can just ask Siri.
Agreed.  However - if you start Spotify from your phone first it works somewhat better.
Sold by gadget-town and Fulfilled by Amazon.

99% of the time - unless an item on Amazon SPECIFICALLY says "Ships and Sold by Amazon.com" you are getting a 'grey market' item.  Perfectly legal but manufacturers usually don't stand behind items sold on those channels.

According to Pioneers own website, Amazon.com is not an authorized dealer for Pioneer Car Electronics (they are for Home electronics).

Backup camera works great. I'll see if I can take some photos of it working later today.

The NEX head units will play whatever music you throw at them while in CarPlay mode.  If you go to "Now Playing" it will show whatever music and app you are using since it's tied into the music part of iOS.   Controlling playlists, etc from Non CarPlay apps will have to be done from your phone first.

Waze is great and all but what I really want is Navigon, Sygic or similar doing CarPlay so I have offline navigation.  
Most vehicles, especially those with double DIN openings - are fairly easy to install these in.  Just get the correct wiring harness for your vehicle and match it up to the Pioneer harness.   In most cases that should be it. Some vehicles may require a little more work if they route some of the door chimes, etc into the factory head unit.

I generally head over to Crutchfield.com, punch the vehicle in and see what parts I may need.     In the case of the 4000NEX, realize that if you buy on Amazon (currently as of 10/6) you aren't buying from an 'Pioneer Authorized Dealer' but a 3rd party reseller and Pioneer won't honor their warranty.  I'd recommend Squaretrade or similar if you go that route.

You can also look at the ['Microbypass'](http://amzn.com/B00F6X1ZPK) vs. the TR-7 since the Microbypass doesn't require any programming and works just fine for the 4000NEX.
When the CarPlay compatible apps are released you will be able to swipe left/right to access more apps.

Sticher, iHeartRadio, Beats, etc haven't actually released their CarPlay compatible apps to general public yet.
Other than Snoo - it is transparent.

I've got this: [BOYO VTL375HD HD Rear View Camera](http://amzn.com/B0051XB2NK)

Paired with this: [Pioneer AVH-4000NEX](http://amzn.com/B00IXPM03Y)

Works great.  The license plate frame came with black screws so it's hard to notice unless you're really looking that it has a camera.  It came with enough wire to run from the back of my Excursion all the way to the front and is easy to set up.   Rather than complicate things mine is basically on whenever my car is on and auto kicks over when my headunit senses being in reverse.  Whats nice about this is I can always put it on rear view even when driving down the road.   Its held up in plenty of rain, snow, 100F+ heat and other bad weather.  My only gripe is that it is really, really wide angle.  It will take you a little getting used to the view vs. how close you are.

The NEX has adjustable backup lines so you can tailor the setup to your specific vehicle.  



IMHO these are 2 *VERY* different units - the only thing they share is a capacitive touch screen.

The 8000NEX is essentially the 4000NEX with a capacitive screen and built in Navigation (I figure this is why Pioneers website won't let you compare the 4000NEX to any of the other head units).   To me the question is, is that screen worth TWICE the money?   If it were a higher resolution screen I'd consider it, but it isn't.

If your #1 desire is a capacitive touch screen and you're going to be using Carplay the majority of the time with apps then the AppRadio 4 is the one to get

If you want capacitive touch screen AND the ability to do almost everything your phone can do but without actually plugging your phone in, the 8000NEX is the way to go.  I think you'd find yourself using carplay less and less with this.     It does have things like dual zone, HDradio, XM, etc, etc.

Now, my thing with the lower end units (4000NEX and Appradio4) is that they can do almost everything the $1400 8000 can do via carplay or appradio.  iheartradio for hd-radio, SiriusXM app for sat. radio, sygic, waze, apple maps for gps.

It comes simply down to budget IMHO.  If you're willing to spend $1400 on your head unit you're getting the best aftermarket carplay experience currently available.

Sirius/XM Radio is satellite radio and requires a separate antenna and small receiver - regardless of if which head unit you use.

HDRadio is digital radio broadcast on the same frequencies as FM.  Much better quality without the issues that analog FM has (echo, etc).  HDRadio is to radio what Analog TV is to Digital TV. 
I have this in my Ford Excursion and have been happy with it.  It has helped with resonance a ton.

Keep in mind this product and products like it, such as dynamat are NOT for reducing road noise.  They may have an effect on it but ultimately this stuff is designed to reduce or eliminate vibration (like rattling doors).

If you're looking to make your car quieter - look at using both this product AND an Ensolite foam (as /u/brokendown mentioned).
It never gets past this screen?  Have you taken the SD card out?
There is something like this: http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/Car/Stage4/DEX-P99RS

But alas, it is a single din and obviously doesn't do CarPlay.

They need to do that as a double din touch screen.
Or this: [http://i.imgur.com/qkl9bmB.png](http://i.imgur.com/qkl9bmB.png)
Something simple like: [http://i.imgur.com/TnBd8ee.png](http://i.imgur.com/TnBd8ee.png) ?
If you're willing to forego your knobs and have very few buttons AND are willing to go virtually all touch screen then I'd recommend a Pionner NEX series head unit OR the Alpine ICS-X7HD.

Keep in mind that (for now) Pioneer and Alpine are the only companies doing aftermarket Carplay.   And as of right now Pioneer is the ONLY aftermarket company offering Carplay.   

Your other option would be to do it custom and fabricate something with the knobs you want and adapt a steering wheel kit to talk to the head unit itself.

Or buy a Ferrari.
What made you go with the 5000 vs other NEX models?
I do use 10.10.   Continuity and Handoff are disabled on both my phone and my Mac.

The M8 is a fantastic phone - but the damn camera film/scratch/whatever issue killed it for me.  Once the film was off the pictures looked much better for about a month and then the blurriness came back.    Used polishing compound and was great for a few weeks.... then it came back.   I used toothpaste and it got slightly better but I still get a slight 'haze' on my pictures.  Ended up just getting another phone.

I really, really, REALLY wish they'd used 1) a better anti-reflective coating and 2) better material for the camera lens.
You're stuck running iOS 6?
If you're not using it in campgrounds or parks then I say go for it.   


Jesus Christ.

If yours is bent, take it to the Apple store and get it replaced.

If you think it won't last you two years, replace it and get a different phone.

Nobody is forcing you to keep this phone.

I'm so fucking tired of people whining and then choosing to do absolutely nothing.  Buy a 4.7" iPhone, buy a S5, buy a goddamn Nokia 6910.   Just buy a phone that meets your expectations.  If the 6+ doesn't meet them, move on.
Didn't AT&T start doing this back in 2012?  3GB 3G / 5GB LTE
Mine has also been doing this a few times a day. Different apps running at the time, sometimes Music, sometimes email.
My 6+ has intermittently been doing these shenanigans since launch day.  8.0.2 did nothing to change it.  Sigh.
Poor choice of words, I agree.  That said however, the title of the video is such a poor choice that I wonder if Casey is indeed, intellectually disabled.
Protects the back and sides from scratches, i'm not sure about if I drop it because it's thin.  It does little for the bottom of the phone for the most part. 
Last time I checked iPhones were for sale on the free market.   If these people were lining up outside of a homeless shelter, taking food and then reselling it then that would be a different issue (please don't even go there in this thread).  The iPhone is a luxury, not a necessity, if people want to pay other people to wait in line and get iphones so they can sell them for gain, so be it.    The Apple store where I live sold out of Unlocked phones and T-Mobile iPhones before anything else.  Most of them were for sale on Craigslist and eBay by noon.

I don't know if Casey Niestat was just being a biggot, trying to be sensationalist,  trying to be funny or  being serious - but using that title for his video makes him a fucking moron. Just because you see a bunch of people with similar physical attributes in one location doing the same thing doesn't mean you can also just throw them into a specific group and title.

Chinese Mafia? Really?

edit: poor choice of words - nobody is perfect.
Keep in mind that AT&T is holding back a few features without a Mobile share pan.

Two important ones for me were:

- Ability to disable data on their website for phones (great for my kids)
- Tethering at no extra cost.

Fortunately I'm around a lot of Wifi so I normally get 7-8GB/mo so the 10GB is no big deal for me.

I held on to that unlimited plan until April of this year and realized once I changed away from it, the only reason I had it was because you couldn't get it anymore.  Once you realize that it really isn't unlimited and you're paying $30/mo for it, you'll dump it.
This exceeded my expectations.
I got the 6+ (gold, 128gb) yesterday and got the Apple Brown Leather case.  I'm very happy with it as it doesn't add much to the size.    I had a bookbook for my old iPhone 5 and liked it for a while but it just became a pain if I was holding the phone to my head, + bulk.
This explains the whole "I just went to take a quick shit and missed the UPS guy scenario".  They never even show up at all.
I got here at 4:00AM and the somewhat loose line was streched down to Gymboree.    Half the people are 10ft from eachother.
True, but only if they have a GSM radio in them.  It wasn't that long ago (they maybe still do) sell CDMA only phones.
The AT&T/T-Mobile GSM Model of the iPhone 6 is Model A1549

The Verizon/Sprint CDMA/GSM model if the iPhone 6 is A1586

Hardware wise, they are slightly different phones.
Sprint and Verizon are going to be in the shortest supply due to the fact that they are CDMA phones and the least 'cross compatible' phone Apple makes.

OTOH there should be more (idk if 'plenty') of phones for GSM providers - AT&T & T-Mobile - mainly because these the hardware within these GSM is more globally used.

Also, absolutely everything I just said and everything else in this tread is pure speculation :P
If only they paid taxes on that money......
Businesses should be allowed to spend their profits however they see fit.

You shouldn't be towing that.

The max payload for your truck is 1600lbs
People/gear in your truck = ~800lbs
Hitch is another = 80lbs

That leaves about 720lbs for tongue weight.

If it's 10k lbs fully loaded your tongue weight is ~1000-1500lbs and that's specifically only if you've properly distributed the weight in your trailer.

On top of that, the Expedition has independent rear suspension (unlike the F-150 which has a solid axle).

Take my math out of the equation and go with straight tow weight which is 8900lbs on your truck and you're still 1100lbs over.

I'm not trying to rain on your parade but know that you aren't driving a safe rig on the road.  That trailer is too much for that truck.  Be safe.
2002 Excursion with a V10 getting 9MPG around town.  Suck it.
How much does that trailer weigh?  You probably shouldn't be pulling that trailer....  Please tell me you are at least using a weight distributing hitch.
Because plasti-dip gives a rough, textured look you'll usually just end up making it look like a work truck by blacking out chrome.   

If you're trying to change the look of your truck and want to make it look nice, buy PTM (paint to match) parts and then paint them the same color as your truck.

On the KR I think they are already painted to match, in which case - stahp.
The box isn't necessary.  HTC Advantage small print states that it's not transferable but others on this subreddit haven't had issues using it with a phone they bought used.   The 6 month period for HTC advantage would begin when the previous user bought the phone and activated it on T-Mo so keep that in mind.
I have no affiliation with these people, just did a search over on XDA.

http://unlockcode247.com/
Did you contact HTC about the phone no longer turning on?

HTC will never have the same level of customer service as apple, they can't afford to.  They also don't have the brick and mortar stores that Apple has which certainly is appealing to many people (unfortunately Apple doesn't as easily swap out with computers as they do with idevices).

Also, Apple will tell you to fly a kite if they want if you're out of their warranty and haven't purchased anything extended.  Yes, sure, you may get a rep that will swap out an out-of-warranty phone but that's not the norm.  

Enjoy your new iPhone (soon).

The fact that it won't stop vibrating regardless of flashing, etc means it's clearly a hardware issue.  Fortunately you're getting a replacement so not a big deal.  Weird for sure.

I haven't tried a external hard drive but it will charge my phone albeit a little slowly.  The head unit was $599 when I bought it 6 months ago.  The MHL adapter came as part of a $59 kit.  Expensive, yes, but it's the ONLY adapter I've used that works flawlessly.

Frankly, I'd run a separate micro-usb w/ a 2A source to the MHL adapter to get the best of both worlds, fast charging.
I have a Pioneer AVH-8500BHS along with a HTC One M8.

Using AppRadio Unchained it works fantastic.   I have exactly what you're talking about - one USB in the glove box and one in the center console that i use to hook up my phone.  After going through several MHL adapters I finally just went and bought Pioneers and it works flawlessly.     There is no tangible difference between using the head unit and using the phone.

I do use the app "CarHome Ultra" to have an easy to access screen on my deck.

I also really like that I can just say "OK google" and issue my phone a command without touching anything - including calling people.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Can't say I like it more.  InsertCoin and ARHD are very similar it's just a matter of preference.  I like what baadnews has done with the insertcoin market, kontrol and themes.
I'm a big fan of the insertcoin ROM which, like android revolution HD is a sense 6 based ROM so you get they best of both worlds
Honestly, before you ever actually cut the cord I would call customer retention (call their main number and ask for customer retention).

However since you've already cancelled service you will need to wait at least 2 years to become a new customer.   They won't offer much of anything to you until then.


I ran my first m8 without a case and can tell you that it didn't hold up that well.   I found the dot view case to be too cumbersome and limited.   The Slimarmor rearranges the same shape while providing good protection. 
Take a look at the spigen slim armor.  Or maybe you should consider using a skin instead 
Got two of these for myself and the wife. After a month they just became a total pain in the ass to use. Got a spigen slim armor case and haven't looked back 
Carriers like AT&T are already doing this with things like their Next program, technically.
Not that I ever download anything in this category but Easynews responds to DMCA takedowns with lightning speed now.  Over 10 years with them and it's time to move on :(
The usenet provider I've been using for about 10 years is failing almost everything unless I get it within the first 30 minutes of it being posted.  Time to try some other (non Highwinds) providers.  I'm a little bummed because I was easily able to saturate my 100mbit connection with them.
Sweet! Nice work!
Initially I loved the Dot View Case because of the notification system.  After a month I pretty much hate it.  It makes using the phone a total PITA in my opinion.   My M8 is going back to HTC due to a purple blotch on the screen and the new one will just get a skin on it and a screen protector.  That way I protect it from scratches - if I drop it, I drop it.
I did end up receiving mine... 3 months after ordering.  It then broke after a week :(
I've been happy with Easynews for 10 years up until recently - seems like nothing is on there anymore.
Where is this wonderful device located? If not in the US I'd like to build one for my kids.
Unless they sell you a protection plan which does, in fact, put more money in their wallet.  I've had several BB employees bullshit about what is going to break on a device and how I should have the PP. 
Tacky? Yes.

Somewhat useful if you live in a cold climate to keep ice off your dish.

If you live somewhere with a lot of sun it's going to fade quick and I'd be concerned that all black could cause enough expansion that it would mess with your signal if it's already borderline.
I'll try and answer as much of this as I can:

Better to call sooner than later so they can book you on the day you want.  Since it will be outsourced to a 3rd party installer (the truck will say DirecTV on it but it's a 3rd party doing the work), the more time, the better.

The Wireless genie should work fine for you in that situation. 

As far as all the discounts go, yes you can stack stuff but it's really going to depend on the customer rep you talk to at DirecTV (call DirecTV directly, do NOT go through a reseller).     Quality on most channels will bet better than Charter although DirecTV tends to really compress your local channels so they may look 'worse' on DTV than charter.

Your price will go up at the end of the obligation, 1 year or 2 years.  If you decide you no longer want D* at the end of your contract then just let them know and they'll send you some boxes to return the receivers in.  The dish will remain on your house unless you remove it.

If there is a problem and the service stops working AND it is because of DirecTV then they'll fix it.  If it is because of your own wiring or something in your house, you will pay UNLESS you have the protection plan.  If you have the protection plan then they'll pretty much fix anything inside and out and you'll be able to get better upgrades at the end of your contract.   

Yes on your contractual prices.

Some may disagree but I tip the installers (especially) on a new install since it requires a decent amount of work and their employers (3rd party) don't generally pay all that great.  No, you are NOT going to get free channels doing this but I end up with an installer who gave much more attention to detail that one who I don't tip.   Throwing some bones there way when they get there makes a big difference.

I hope this helps, I've had DirecTV for almost 15 years and wouldn't change.  In my experience their customer service is second to none and if you treat them with respect it'll go far.  They are one of the few places that appreciate a customer is sticking with them.  I don't know how this will be affected by the AT&T buyout :(
I highly doubt he'd have an issue in any campground with that rig.   Yes, some 'resorts' only allow Class A rigs so he couldn't do that.

Most of the time its the condition that matters more than the age.  A 15 year old rig can be in great condition.   Generally people who are driving a POS aren't going to be looking to stay in those campgrounds anyways.
My only concern when full timing with any kind of motorhome is that if something needs to go in for repair, you're out both your living quarters and your vehicle if you're not towing a car behind it.    
The RP-172 would be great for your needs and the Grand Cherokee would tow it easily so the Expedition would obviously be fine as well.

I assume you and your wife don't want to sleep in the same bed since the 172 has bunks vs a queen bed?

Doesn't anyone here use mysms? It allows you to receive and respond to sms' on all of your devices.

I agree with others on here regarding a 3/4 truck.  I don't always agree about the diesel option.  

Pros:
Better mileage
More torque to tow
The engine will probably outlast the rest of the truck

Cons:
You'll pay more for it initially
It will cost more to maintain (even oil changes will cost you more)
Some diesels need $$ to be rock solid (Ford 6.0 comes to mind)

Are you buying new or used?
What is your budget?
After you've made your trip, will it be a daily driver?


This will be fantastic.  I've been using the stock apps so I can take advantage of the DotView case.
Pioneer AVH-8500BHS + HTC One M8 + MHL Adapter = Android Bliss
correct
It does give you another 250 coins.  So far I've gotten GTA:SA, Minecraft and Sonic 2 for nothing
After that go buy minecraft for 699 coins and earn back 350.
I flashed to the Google Play Edition using the RUU and couldn't be happier.  Clean stock Android. 
[Android File Transfer](http://www.android.com/filetransfer/)
I wouldn't fear the Sense roms - they are pulling all the crap and bloatware out of the roms and leaving you with stock sense.  Best of both worlds, IMHO.
You wouldn't have all the LTE bands.  Right now AT&T is using 4 and 17 which the T-Mobile version does as well but AT&T is starting to use 2.

The question you have to ask is how many true hardware variants of the M8 are there?   

Take this with a ****ing massive grain of salt:   I'm going to assume that all the North American GSM M8s use the same hardware and that the radio firmware is the only thing that HTC is really changing.   I don't know if anyone has tried this but theoretically if you unlock the phone, update the radio firmware and install a ROM from that provider then you'll have the same phone they sell.

Once you SuperCID and S-OFF you'd be able to do this - I'd take a long look at the XDA M8 forums where these firmwares are posted and see if anyone has tried this yet.
Actually, if you SuperCID you *can* flash different radio firmware on to your M8. There shouldn't really be any issue flashing a T-Mobile radio firmware onto a GPe m8.
You're either going to have to use the Sense 6 toolbox or install a custom Rom like Android Revolution HD or InsertCoin that are Sense based roms.
Sweet, thought I'd have to go back from GPE to Sense to get full use of my dot view case.
What kind of head unit?  I have a Pioneer AVH-8500BHS and it connects just fine.

Although some of those purchases are optional, some of those apps vastly improve your experience and it's worth throwing a few bucks the developers way.
As long as Android can keep eating away at iOS marketshare by converting customers (me as of a week ago) then they'll also see those same customers purchase apps on the Play store.   After moving to an HTC One m8 (from 7 years an iPhone user) as my primary device I've probably spent ~$75 just in the first week alone in the play store on apps.

I used this the day after I received my iPhone 5 (launch day).  

AT&T unlocked my iPhone 5 within about a week.    
I'd be surprised if this doesn't start showing up in aftermarket head units.  It's just an app built into iOS.     It's essentially no different than AppRadio mode.
I had that headunit for about a week.  When I realized the cost for what features it had, it went back and I got a Pioneer AVH-8500BHS.  
I love Excursions.

This looks to be a 2000-2004 with upgraded grille and headlights.  Not a huge fan of the wheels either but not too bad.

As someone who drives one every day, it's really not that hard to parallel park these things once you get used to them
It's actually running a custom rom already (TnT Lite) which from my understanding should have google apps in it.

That said, XDA shows quite a few custom roms for the tablet.
As an Excursion owner, I came here to see an Excursion.

Was not disappointed.
LuLous is my personal favorite.

I also like Johnnys and Marios Portafino.

Campo is over-hyped.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good but nothing amazing. 
It's actually pretty cool since you're getting perspectives on things you wouldn't normally get with that set up.
Let's see a picture taken with that!
Yes, you won't have any problems.  Just install the AppRadio app on your device and then get a HDMI and USB/Lightning cable (along with with the adapter) and you'll be good to do.
As someone with a lazy eye, I really appreciate that you find humor in this.
Nice try, Russian Board of Tourism.
Generally in a lower priced neighborhood you're going to have slightly higher crime rates, no HOA (good and bad) and a more transient population.

Here's some demographics here:  http://www.movoto.com/neighborhood/nv/reno/89506.htm

Head over to AlertID.com and signup and then enter that address to see the most recent crimes around there as well as sex offenders.

There is only a few places I'd tell someone NOT to look at:
- Sun Valley (there are nicer stick built homes in the back of Sun Valley)
- Neil Road area

Reno is pretty large especially when you look at the North Valleys that stretch all the way to the CA border.  You're still technically in Reno but driving from Bordertown to downtown will be a ~20 minute drive.

You could also look in N. Carson City, something close to I580, then Reno is a quick drive down the interstate.

If its private party you'll pay NV sales tax.  If its a dealer you'll pay their sales tax
Do not. I repeat, DO NOT buy from a used car dealer in this town (unless its a CPO with a manufacturer warranty)

You will get a MUCH better deal finding a private seller (even privatepartycars is fine), plus you will NOT pay sales tax on the transaction.

What I would do is find a mechanic that is willing to look at the vehicle.  If a seller isn't willing to let you have the car inspected then just walk away.

CarFax is your friend on this as at least you will know if any major accidents were reported and that the title is clean, I also like to google the VIN number and see if it gets hits at multiple dealers in the past.

Spending ~$100 to get a vehicle inspected by a mechanic is worth it.

The only thing used car dealers are good at is polishing turds.
I've dealt with Peggy over at Paramount Auto-Body and they had second-to-none customer service.  
I'm not a Realtor but I'm happy to give you whatever information you need. I can recommend several.

If you want 80k or less with at least 4 bedrooms, there are currently 4 listings in the cities of Reno/Sparks.  They are all Short Sales and all 2 bath:

1975 Trainer Way for $60k

365 Wellington for $70k

318 Wheeler for $75

1880 Trainer for $80k



If you're looking 3 Bedroom/2Ba there are 7 listings to choose from currently (also short sales):

15004 Cuprite St	$45,000

1750 Castle Way	$60,000 

5489 Yukon Drive	$65,000
 
17815 Georgetown Drive	$70,000 

7745 Yorkshire Drive	$73,000 

6620 peppermint Drive	$75,000 

8710 Aquifer Way	$79,000 

Short sales make up VERY little of the entire market but they do make up a good chunk of the price point you are looking for.  Cash certainly helps in this situation.  However, many of these don't have bank approval yet so you could be waiting.

I hope this helps you, let me know if you want any more info.
Does the OSD show up on a NON-HDMI inputs?
Someone beat the Chevy Reaper with an ugly stick :(
I have to say that I recently purchased a Samsung 7100 65" LED and after using Avia, WOW and some other stuff I really, really like the picture on it.   I also have a 50" Panasonic Plasma that I LOVE but with the right calibration these LEDs can look fantastic, especially if you have a good amount of light coming in the room.
Even if you don't want it, you'll easily turn a profit selling it on fleabay
The answer is YES.

It's called a Diplexer and they are frequently used to tie an OTA antenna and a satellite together into one cable and then broken out again once inside the house.
The one on "Hell Freezes Over"
Rather than the AppRadio 3, I'd look at the Pioneer AVH headunits.

I've had the Alpine ICS-X7HD, a Sony XAV-602T and a Pioneer AVH-8500BHS installed in my truck.

Originally I had the Sony - I like the user interface AND if you're using Mirrorlink it's a great head unit.  I'm using an iPhone and the experience using the Sony AppRemote wasn't very elegant.

I liked the Alpine because the user interface was close to what you'll find in most vehicles that come with a screen/av unit from the factory.  What I didn't like and figured out really quickly is that the screen didn't register my responses and I'd find myself tapping multiple times to get it to do something.  

I finally got the Pioneer and while the interface isn't the prettiest, it does move fast.  I also love the AppRadio mode.  With my iPhone I can use AppRadio Extensions to allow any app to work on it OR if you're on Android you can use ARLiberator or AppRadio unchained.

If I could have the look of the Alpine with the functionality of the Pioneer, I'd be a happy camper.  
Same as sprint (ok but not amazing).   However all calls will use wifi if available.  You're only on the sprint network when there is no wifi.
Check out Republic Wireless
I've timed it, it's always 29-31s after I send the command.

Installer even said "it will start 30 seconds after you hit the button". I was excited at first just having it.  Now I realize it's insanely annoying to wait 30 seconds. 
I was able to find a 32GB Samsung SD card at best buy for $8 close out.  Fortunately my head unit has a sd slot but virtually all flash storage has gotten cheap.

I'll use spotify and pandora in town but longer trips it's nice to have my library with me. XM is ok bit audio quality is lacking.
That kit looks fine to me for what you are doing and even if you upgrade down the road.
I have a late 2012 MacBook Air and was considering getting the game.  Should I even bother?

Which GTMAT did you get?  The Onyx or the asphalt based one?

If you got their cheapest type - you overpaid for what is essentially 'peel and seal'

If you got their most expensive type, the Onyx - you probably paid more per sqft than Dynamat.

IMHO, after looking at Raamat, GTmat, Dynamat, Stinger, SecondSkin and others I ended up going with the Stinger Roadkill as I wanted a butyl/aluminum dampening product vs asphalt.   Butyl dampening you can get away with 25% coverage to at least stop a lot of resonance - whereas a asphalt based dampener you're looking at a lot more coverage.

When you want to go beyond that look at products that use Ensolite.


I'd be fine with 'grey water' from the washing machine being used for the toilet (not the other way around though).

Be nice if houses came with a grey water line that you could use for things like this.
I used this site extensively when I had my WJ's:

http://wjjeeps.com/

http://wjjeeps.com/audioupgrade.htm


I had a couple WJ's - I ended up fabricating a 2.75 to 2" adapter and using 2" tweeters using some sheet metal.  It was really pretty damn easy.  I'd say it's worth it as I found the WJ to be a great vehicle acoustically (at least when it wasn't moving).



* Heatgun
* Scraper
* Googone

It's gonna be a bitch but that's the easiest way.
Nice work. 

One question:  Why not use a FLCAN vs the hidden key?
If you live in a part of Reno that has wiring over 20 years of age - neither AT&T nor Charter will be perfect.

AT&T does not enforce their caps in this market.

Some parts of South Reno have FTTP (fiber to the premesis) which (currently) is limited to the 18mbit package.

I've had the 100mbit service from Charter for 2 years now with zero downtime (south Reno/double diamond).  However my offices in Incline Village and on Lakeside go doen several times per month.

I also had ATT at my house which also had no downtime.  However it was essentially Ethernet over fiber vs the VDSL Uverse offerings.
Take a look at Stinger Roadkill as well.  Cheaper than Dynamat and just as effective.
What head unit and what wiring harness did you purchase.  Did you make sure that some of the 'obvious' cables (red, yellow, black/grnd) are wired correctly?

Also, are you sure you are properly turning the unit on?
Glad I could help!   If you end up going with the Pioneer, check out AppRadioWorld.com and AVIC411.com.
I'd consider unlocking it and using it with T-Mobile.  At least that way you'll be able to use all the features of it.
I'm saying to get a headunit that will show your iphone display and allow you to interact with it - best of both worlds.  Look at the Pioneers with Advanced App Mode.
Do you use a smartphone?   I found it more beneficial to get a headunit without nav (Pioneer AVH-8500BHS) and use my nav app of choice.

Otherwise if you go with that unit I'm sure JVC/Kenwood have a European disc for it (navteq or tomtom)
In my experience when it resprings :(
Tweaks installed via Cydia.  Things such as dimmer, f.lux, RetinaPad, etc.
Installed just fine here on a iPhone 5.

Happy that AppRadio Extensions works in iOS7.
He mentioned a powered sub.  Line-out converter would allow him to do that.
Running the sub off the rear speakers IS absolutely doable.  It is far from the most ideal way to run it though.  All you need is a line out converter.

What is your budget?  As long as you go with a decent brand of powered sub (Pioneer, MTX, Kicker, Kenwood, Infinity, etc.) you should be fine.  Most if not all of those powered subs will have amps with built in crossovers / low pass filters.
AMTP is a little dated but my understanding with implementing it on the headunits is that it will allow you to control the music on your Android device similar to how head units currently talk to iPhones/iPods.
According to your diagram, this is a 4ohm load since the lower VC isn't even connected:

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/5YMVgxC.jpg)

I'm kidding. It's a 2ohm load.
I just finished building the following machine for a client:

- Asus ROG Extreme IV Motherboard
- Intel i7-4930
- 32GB Corsair Dominator RAM
- 1TB Samsung SSD
- 2x eVGA 780ti superclocked video cards
- C70 vengance case with H100 cooler

This. Thing. Flies.
An update to this:

The AVH-8500BHS does NOT have a similar harness to the AVIC-850 and there are no free pins. I read about grounding the mute and parking brake together but for the next few days I'll just unplug and plug in my relay and when the microbypass arrives I'll use that.  

No reason to use a switch if the process can be automated.
Shit - thank you!  This is worth a try!  Gonna try this first thing in the AM and report back!  Appreciate it!

Edit:  I did order a microbypass - I have no interest in having to flip a switch to do this.  I'd rather just have it automatic.

Edit2:  So reading around, it sounds like with AppRadio2 and AVIC models you just need to insert some wire into the empty slot next to the mute and then ground it to bypass this.     I'll try this tomorrow and let you now.

Thanks - regardless, you put me on the right path.
yes - didn't realize that was a DVC.  
I have that amp and I like it but for that sub you could give it a bit more power.  That amp will do 300W at 4Ω  and 500 at 2Ω RMS.   That sub is rated for 3.8Ω so you're looking closer to ~300W

edit: Imma Derp. Thats DVC sub so you're good to go. That amp runs pretty cool and works great for the price.
I'd go with the GMOS-04 if that is suggested.  The differences most likely are that some more features are in that Monsoon stereo rather than the standard stereo.  I would get the right harness vs. taking the chance.
You'll need a wiring harness such as: Metra 70-1761 and a dash kit such as the Metra 95-8202.

Recently I had the Sony WX-GT90BT which works great for a feature-packed double din headunit (I'm not a fan of single din w/ pocket).   There is single DIN version (MEXBT-3100P) of this unit as well if you do want to go that route.  I was really happy with this unit.

If he has a smart phone (android/iphone) then Sony makes an App called  AppRemote that allows you to control all the features on your phone and vice versa.
Although I'm not a huge fan of Best Buy - this is on sale right now:

Shop around and you'll find the VT-GMRC-01 harness or similar for ~$50

http://amzn.com/B0007KK2DS - Dash kit on Amazon for $12

Antenna Harness for $4 - http://amzn.com/B0002BEQN4

You're going to to go a little over $100 but this is easily doable. 
Tried that. Didn't make any difference.
I'll give that a try - thanks!
Tried that before getting the Y adapter.   The sub output is turned on in the head unit.
Frankly this is why I went with a unit (Sony XAV-602BT) that ties to my cell phone for navigation (there is an optional $250 tom tom nav kit available)

The unit also is incredibly easy to control with a nice quality screen.
A psp? What are you, 19?
Glad to hear the pedal works again.     Unhook the stereo, replace any blown fuses again and see if everything works fine now.   Then hook stereo back up and see if it blows.    If you blow a fuse, you know it's a stereo - if it still does the same thing even with the stereo unhooked look at the 'body control module' which should be around (or part of) your interior fuse block.
Are you sure your vehicle has electronic vs cable throttle?
I drive a 4WD Ford Excursion.  Not only does everyone expect me to make it wherever I need to go, but they also expect me to bring their entire family/kids with them.

Seriously - I got a call yesterday saying "You can come in, right?" when others had been given the OK to 'work from home'. 
Can't go wrong with Polk.  Those are pretty good speakers for the price. 
I'll still listen to the local radio  in the morning for some stuff, otherwise I'm streaming from Spotify or listening to Channel 95 on SirusXM.
Honestly the easiest thing to do is head over to Crutchfield.com, see what fits your car and then look at the customer reviews and check them against other sites such as Amazon and Sonixelectronics.
Manzanita at the Ritz-Carlton at Northstar. It's isn't that expensive (~$36 per person) and is fantastic.  Also, it's a beautiful setting.  They do a great job for Thanksgiving dinner. 
Sony WX-GT90BT
If I may recommend something that will hit considerably harder:

Sony XSGTX121LS 12" Subwoofer with enclosure
http://amzn.com/B0042X964W

Kenwood 5001PS Mono amp
http://amzn.com/B00B8B0Q9A

I currently have this setup and have been very impressed with how hard it hits and sounds for the price. I've got it in a Ford Excursion that has considerable more cabin room than a pickup but that sub is designed to go into a small space.

Have you followed the wiring?  It could be something as simple as a broken or shorted wire to the speaker.  Check the molex connector in the door as well.
I use my iPhone, iPad and Nexus 7 with my Sony WX-GT90BT headunit.   There is an app for Android and iOS called App Remote that allows you to control the entire head unit from the device and vice versa.   This way I was easily able to tie into the factory wiring harness, still have a stereo when I don't have a tablet/phone.  It's also nice to have handsfree bluetooth in the car (The HU will connect to both at the same time).  With iOS you will use a cable to the unit, with Android you can do everything via bluetooth.
Installed one in my own vehicle yesterday and this past weekend in a friends to power door components, they work great
How old was the prior Pioneer radio?  I'm surprised you couldn't just use the existing wiring harness.
This is probably the guy that did it:

Holy crap! glad you walked away unharmed.

Contact the credit card company you used as well as your own car insurance.  U-Haul likes to tell you it doesn't but many Visa cards will cover it.
Get a sony WX-GT90BT and hook your Android/iOS device to it and play your music app of choice.

The sail panels have space for a tweeter (later model super duties had built in tweeters).  So I'm thinking to have them installed there.
Check out the Sony receivers with App Remote in it.  I can control my entire deck (and vice versa) over bluetooth with my Android tablet or via the lightning cable with my iPhone 5.  It's actually a pretty good interface, IMHO.

I'm generally not a fan of black wheels but.. damn!   The little pop of color adds a nice touch and makes the wheel much more interesting.  Nice work!
This album came out almost 20 years ago originally but was re-released with newer songs back in '06.

I'm not a fan of some of the newer themes but the Inspector Gadget, Pink Panther and I dream of Jeannie ones are pretty fun for bass.

I assume you're using the FM transmitter to keep your factory stereo in place?

If you insist on using an FM transmitter, may I suggest this:
http://www.amazon.com/Scosche-FM-MOD02-Universal-Modulator-Satellite/dp/B001QBG614/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1382482702&sr=8-2&keywords=fm+aux

You can also find Bluetooth versions.  I like these only because they tie into the antenna input of your stereo and (at least in my experience) have the least amount of interference. 


I had symptoms to this but they were prior to starting Fluoxetine and Lorazepam.  It took me going to the ER (thought I was having a heart attack) and finding out it was anxiety/panic attacks.  I also found out my blood pressure was elevated (normally not)  Symptoms felt like outward pressure against my temples and sinus area which is why I asked.   I hope he figures something out.
I'm not a doctor but does he take blood pressure medication?  If not, what is his blood pressure.  Elevated blood pressure can give you those symptoms (as can other things).
60A wiring is generally 6 gauge.
I just installed the Sony WX-GT90BT and freaking love it.  You can completely control the head unit from an iOS or Android device.
Thanks for the feedback - so it looks like those speakers are running at 2ohms?  I'm using all the factory wiring, so I figure whatever Ford did with splitting it up couldn't be too bad.
Any loud music can cause hearing loss, subs or not.   Do you find yourself more frequently turning the volume up since you installed the subs?    

Do you get some ringing in your ears that goes away after a few moments?
I don't think it's even a fair comparison, IMHO the views at Valley of Fire are much more impressive than Red Rock Canyon.  RRC has more trails to hike and has their amphitheater but as you saw, VOF is spectacular.   You definitely saw the better of the two first!
When you say both, are you referring to both the Android device and the iPhone at the same time?  Or are you referring to being able to have the sound and charge at the same time.

In scenario 1 where you have 2 devices, you could simply get a splitter and run 2 audio outs to the same aux input.

In scenario 2 then you'd want to use something like this http://amzn.com/B003MRF094 for a 30pin (4S or older iPhone) or get a  lightning to 30pin adapter (it does pass audio) for an iPhone 5 or newer.
I'm from Northern Nevada and after numerous trips down to that area, finally went to see Valley of Fire this past year right after we got our new Travel Trailer.     Holy crap, I was floored by the beauty of this place - it was amazing to camp in, as there are a couple great campgrounds in there.  Please tell me you had a chance to get off that main road and explore some more because there is truly amazing scenery there.

I wanted something similar to what you're asking and found a solution that worked well for me.

I just purchased a Sony WX-GT90BT for my Excursion and it's a pretty vanilla looking headunit but what I *really* like is how it works with my Nexus 7.  I can completely control the headunit from the tablet including using Google maps (or whatever Nav I want).

Here's a video of someone using an iPad but it's the same with an android device (Androids can do it wirelessly via bluetooth vs 30pin connector).   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAbnrlaq-1Q

I'm pretty sure there are single DIN Sony head units that have the same 'App Remote' feature.

Edit:  Yep, here's a Sony video using a single DIN:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TfeJaNF5dk
Single or double DIN?
If you think it looks good, sure.  Keep in mind that you're doing this not to add value to your truck but to personalize it.  It may not garner any extra value if you go to sell your truck (the opposite actually, people may think it was involved in an accident).   I have aftermarket grille exterior parts and they're fine - I just know I may have to replace it sooner than later.
Single or Double DIN?
No.. much, MUCH more expensive.
Sigh.  The money he spent for the install, he could have bought aftermarket speakers.   Why do people think that an install like this is difficult enough to pay for someone?  Not to mention it's just a big rats nest of wires back there.  I'm also not a huge fan of mounting the amp to the box...
Less than $2,000 if all aftermarket parts but some of those parts aren't going to be easy to find aftermarket.  The hood, bumper, valance, lights and mirrors will be easy but the fenders and header panel, not so much.
You're going to need to mate the header panel from the 2011 SD to your 2001.  With that and the correct hood and fenders, you should be good to go. The header panel will allow you to put the headlights, bumper, etc without cutting anything up.

Keep in mind that going completely aftermarket on a lot of these parts isn't fantastic - a lot of times they don't match up quite right and be a pain to put on.  Also, they may weather a LOT quicker.

Yes, works great.  Better than the Jabra Journey I was using.

I like how it looks but I still have work to do with tying in the factory DVD so it's not in all the way.

I do have stock speakers and am very pleased with the improvement.

Also, you can set the display to be any color that you want so you can go with the Ford green which makes for a nice match.
I just installed the Sony WX-GT90BT in my Excursion and love it.  I didn't want a touchscreen deck in my truck and this hit the bill.  Plus, you can control it (and vice versa) from a Phone or tablet so if you still want a touchscreen you can still do it.  It's pretty sweet and priced right.

http://store.sony.com/p/Sony-Car-Stereo/en/p/WXGT90BT  (I suggest buying from Crutchfield or Amazon)
You don't find the cool white in the cab a little jarring/office-like?
I have the 2002 OEM Version of this ;)
It's hard to say.   I have a 28' Travel Trailer that weights about 8000lbs when full.  

The problem lies in the Raptors Payload and tongue weight capacity.  

Lets say you're towing that 8000lb trailer, you need to account in the tongue weight, which is usually 10-15% of the trailers weight.  Lets say 10% or 800lbs in this instance (in reality it's going to be closer to 15% or 1200lbs which means before you add anything else, you're already past the payload capacity).    Now you've reduced the payload capacity of your Raptor to 230lbs.  That's either 1 person and their luggage in the truck or 2 people with their stuff in the trailer.  Unfortunately people see 8000lb towing capacity and immediately think they can put a 8000lb trailer on the back with nothing else and call it a day (you could but it won't be safe)

I'd consider a small boat or <5000lb travel trailer/PUP trailer but the Raptor is not an adequate tow vehicle for most people.

Outside of weight and tow ratings, the Raptor is also a fairly short wheelbase vehicle which isn't going to do you any favors going down the highway. 

There's a reason you see most people towing campers with 3/4ton+ trucks.  Please don't just listen to the RV or Truck dealer who's spitting out numbers just trying to make a deal.

Is it just me or does Hogwarts have a very close resemblance to this?
My father, originally a navy seal and then went on to successfully manage several UK oil companies.   We got everything we asked for, lived in massive houses, traveled everywhere, drove nice cars.  I thought it was cool and wanted to follow exactly in his footsteps.  I'd talk to him about running the companies he ran when I became an adult and doing whatever he did because it looked awesome.

Until I got old enough to realize that he was ruthless when it came to business and relationships, both personal and professional.   He stepped on a lot of people to get where he was and made my mother miserable.  I vowed at about 14 years old I wouldn't end up being like him.

I'm happy to say that I feel that I've been pretty successful, I have a family, kids and everything else but without being a complete piece of shit in the process and having a family that loves me for who I am and not what I have.

tl;dr: wanted to be a astronaut,  now work in tech and marketing.

Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and need more pictures of that Excursion.
The matte black door handles make me think this is an XLS or XLT?
I have to admit, I was surprised that they still are pushing out the 16GB version.  I really thought there would just be a 32/64 option with the 5S (128GB would have been great too).

After the keynote I feel like the iPhone is becoming the iCamera with a phone attached to it.   It's frustrating - I've got a ton invested into the iOS ecosystem but it's really starting to feel stale - even with iOS7.
I'm sorry - I currently have an iPhone 5, a couple Apple TV's, A Macbook air and a bunch of Apple products.  Generally I'd be right on buying the next iPhone but this is a freakin' yawn-fest.   If it's the same old iPhone with some new stuff inside then it's time for me to look at getting the Nexus 5.    I can't deal with the tiny screen and boring look.  iOS 7 looks good but I'd love to see it on a device with a bigger screen.

If Apple brings out a 4.5" or bigger screen I'll be a very happy person.
Does you school participate in DreamSpark? If it does and has DreamSpark premium you can get Fusion at no cost.
As others have said it's (IMHO) important to know Photoshop, Indesign and Illustrator as they all work well together.

I like using Adobe Bridge to keep my projects/ads together.  Works quite well.
Costco becomes pretty miserable around this time of year.   I don't mind burners and next year I'd like to go but there are freakin RV's and men wearing sundresses all over the place.
Pretty sure this is in Reno, NV - love this picture.
That front end looks like a call back to the old '88-98 front end.
Verified it's a kit: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=283958645048124&set=a.215696795207643.41421.107987752645215&type=1&theater

I saw this in Reno and thought WOW but something about the rear end looked cheap and non-original.
Bought mine with 42K miles in March for $11,500
Looks like a kit IMHO.

Are you in Reno, NV?
Are you sure about this?  I have a Nexus 7 that connects to my iPhone just fine.  The iPhone is running MyWi which does, in fact, create an ad-hoc connection.
Care to elaborate?  I've been an avid Apple user for many years and just bought the Nexus 7.   I quit using my iPad shortly after getting this and love it.  What didn't you like about it?
You're awesome.  Thank you!
That feature uses a separate processor/core in the Moto X, so it's really a hardware feature.    It would gobble up battery like crazy otherwise.
Is there any way to have map info cached on the device?  I just got a Nexus 7 and it spanks the iPad but I really want to use it in my vehicle.  I was hoping someone had a way to cache the maps so I don't have to use a 3rd party offline Nav app or tether the tablet to my phone.  Thanks!
Check Office Depot - their inventory on the website matches the store (or did in my case).  It said they had 1 available.  I walked in and asked for it, they offered me the display and I said sure - but came back with a boxed new 32GB (matching what the website showed)

Edit:  I bought mine a few hours ago.
Except most teachers don't work 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year.  Especially now that WCSD has eliminated track schedules.  Don't get me wrong, I do think teachers deserve more for what they do but they aren't hurting.
Ahh.. I love seeing firefighters making ~$150K.
FYI:  As far as I know, since '99 the SuperDutys have had the wiring for the brake controller already there.
Why not just use google music?
Been there, done that.   Weigh the value of the relationship you have with your best friend against the fun time you'll have with his Ex.

I was in this situation about 12 years ago.  After the relationship was over I regretted the decision I made - even to this day.

What you (and I back then) aren't realizing is that while the ex may be attracted to you now, subconsciously all she is trying to do is also break you up from your best friend.  I didn't realize this until years after we broke up.

So again, you need to weigh those items in your mind and see which is worth more to you.  I'm not saying 'don't do it' but just be prepared to live with whatever decision you make.
Voted!  Good luck!
Nice work - there are some things I'd suggest looking at.

Picture 3 (entry), I'd recommend getting in front of the latch and that wall on the right hand side.

Picture 6 (entrance to kitchen)  Your eyes are drawn to the wall with the thermostat and pillows - I don't know if I'd use that picture.

Picture 9 (kitchen).  The serving dish needs to go, buyers don't want to see personal artifacts in the kitchen, especially if it's blocking the view. I'd probably take the lemons out too.

Picture 10 (bathroom).  Did you photoshop yourself out of that one? I see artifacts on the mirror.  I would have tried to stand slightly farther back to get more of the room.

Picture 25 (bathroom 2).  I'd stand farther back again if possible too.

Most of what could make these shots better would be using a shorter focal length like 10-12mm.   With 16mm you're getting wide but you need ultra wide for a lot of rooms.

Also, you can get rid of the blown out whites with the windows by shooting two of the same shots at different exposures and blending them in post/photoshop.  This will make a more accurate representation of what the view is like outside the window.

Tell the sellers (or the agent) that while this is on the market, I'd suggest using incandescent bulbs instead of CFL (CFL makes things VERY yellow) and using Halogen bulbs for can lighting.  Its a small investment for them to make that makes a HUGE difference in pictures as well as in real life when someone is looking at the home. 

I do think you did a great job with composition, nice work!
Thanks. I'm really happy with it and you're right, it does breath some new life into the beast.  She already looks pretty good, only has 49k miles on it.
I read the first page, then I skipped to the last page.

Where he mentioned the engine had been 'tuned' (chipped) I lose any sympathy.  I don't know if that was the first, the third or if he'd done all 3 but as soon as you do that you give the manufacturer a (good) reason to deny a warranty claim.

I'm all for tuning, I'm going to get an SCT from 5-star for my Excursion but he's playing with fire.
I can tell you right now that that property will get sold for residential development. That is some nice real estate that will overlook South Reno.  Not to mention it will be connected to town easily with the South East Connector.

DR Horton alone is building about 20 houses at a time over here, and there is another one building a whole new development on Carat Blvd.
Reading these in my head, I start to think this should be reposted to /r/dolan (yes, it's very strange)
You look like Brains from the old show Thunderbirds.

Definitely change pharmacists - I see plenty of them that decide to take a personal interest in what your taking and think they are more knowledgeable about what you need than your primary physician.  For a little while I had xanax and ativan Rx's at the same time and a pharmacist questioned why I would need both and told me he'd need to talk to my Dr. first before filling the prescriptions.

Keep in mind ativan (and all benzos) are schedule IV controlled substances so I can see why some pharmacists are weary of doling it out.

Don't just stop taking it either, you really should taper off otherwise you're going to feel terrible.   Those benzos aren't great for you long term and your doctor won't prescribe them indefinitely.  Ask your doctor about going on some kind of SSRI for the long term (I personally like fluoxetine/prozac).  I've been taking it for about 3 months now and feel much more level headed/normal and only take the ativan when I'm having a panic attack or if I'm having insomnia from anxiety. 
Please don't post this kind of thing - I end up going by my local goodwill store every day for the next 3 months, only to be disappointed :( 
This is a fantastic name for a band!
How many of you got the 'VIP expiring' message a few minutes ago?  

Also down for me.

Dear god - both of those have side effects I wasn't even interested in dealing with.   I'm on Fluoxetine (Prozac) and it's actually helped with my sex life and actually curbs my desire to eat.

Is there any reason your doctor put you straight on Celexa and Zoloft without trying prozac first?
Lots of hate on Charter here. 

I've been happy with them at my house and 3 offices in Reno, Fernley and Incline.

Speeds remain constant during the day.  I have the 100Mbit service at my house and it screams - even during 'peak' hours.

Maybe it's because I'm using up all the throughput that Charter has in Reno? Muahahahahah (just kidding although I do get ~10-12MB/sec when pulling from some sites)

Edit: And as far as support goes - it's much better than I had with AT&T.  If they can't answer a question or fix something right away, I'll get call backs confirming I'm happy with the resolution.  Granted I've only had to call on the Charter Business lines - the line at my house has literally never gone down in the past 1.5 years.

When I did have AT&T I was 'fortunate' enough to live with they have FTTH (fiber to the home).  Unfortunately with AT&T it means you're stuck at top speeds WORSE than those with DSL based U-Verse.  AT&T FTTH U-Verse is stuck at 18Mbit while DSL U-Verse is at 24Mbit.
I do this drive all the time.  Please, do everyone a favor, even if you're doing 45 - if you've got someone behind you, pull over and let them go by.   For someone who has to do that drive all the time it kills me when I get someone who decides their speed is fast enough for everyone.
I have the 30pin to VGA adapter for my iPad 3 and it mirrors everything, not just a VGA out app. I'm pretty sure the iPad2+ and iPad4+ did VGA out for EVERYTHING and not just specific apps.
If you're going to stop making payments, do it on both.  There is no use paying the second.   Bank the money you're not paying to BofA and let the foreclosure proceedings continue.   Right now you stand only to lose your house, if you file bankruptcy you're putting pretty much all of your other assets too.  Not to mention filing bankruptcy is not as easy as it used to be and will cost you a decent amount.
Are both loans through the same bank?  If so then the first doesn't have to do any negotiation with the second and foreclosure proceedings (or a short sale) will proceed normally.

Don't file bankruptcy unless is the worst-case scenario.   In this day a foreclosure on your credit isn't as bad as it once was.  

The only thing I can think of is going to be if the bank comes after you with a deficiency judgement.   There is no way to know what they will do.   If you do a short sale you could always ask the bank (your realtor or their short sale processing company/person) to waive it if possible.  It does happen.
This will get downvoted because I'm not going to blow a bunch of smoke up your ass.

Will this work out in your favor? The home loans - no.  But if you're going to stop making payments you do have the advantage of essentially living rent free until the bank finishes foreclosure proceedings on your house.  Depending on the real estate market in your area, this could be as short as six weeks or it could take years.   If the real estate market in your area is heating up like a lot of places then the banks want to get you out and get someone in there.    During this time I would bank whatever payment you were making on the house and don't spend it.

Your credit will be fucked for a little while but fortunately, if you decide to buy a house you'll only need to wait 3 years and you'll probably qualify as long as you don't have a bunch of outstanding credit card debt or collections.

Please note that I don't agree with people walking away from their home loans but sometimes, such as situations like this where you are legitimately having hardship, it makes it easier to justify.

So bank that money, live as thrifty as you can, find somewhere decent to rent for a couple years.   Get used to living on cash because frankly it's the smartest way to live - if you can't afford it, don't buy it.

I thought the same thing until I read your post and then googled it. Jesus Christ, I'm 34 for fucks sake. I can't believe I didn't think a Narwhal was real.
No, when I was younger I lived in a town outside of Aberdeen, Scotland and had an Amstrad CPC6128.  One day my parents decide I shouldn't be playing games all the time on there and proceed to chuck all my disks out the Window - including that one.   They all landed in a bunch of rhododendrons and I only got some disks back.  I don't remember if I acutally lost that disk or not but as soon as I saw it, it brought back memories.
It's better to have tried and failed rather than never tried at all.  It won't be easy but I'd at least try before giving up hope.  90% of the things we worry about never actually happen. 

Go for it.
You don't happen to live around Aberdeen, Scotland, do you?
Nurses are generally very unhappy there.  Independent MD/DOs are fairly happy,  MD/DOs actually employed by Renown are only slightly happier than the nurses.  Renown is a machine that swallows you up and spits you out.  There is a lot of petty politics that occurs there and nobody anywhere will lend a sympathetic ear.

As a patient - I prefer Renown.  If I were seeking employment I'd be cautious.
Thank you for this.  I hadn't seen it before.  Now I'm considering getting CNYNERO for my license plate.
V10 gasser - Considering this is my daily driver with a VERY short commute, the diesel just wasn't worth it in the long run.
Just tried this. Neither I nor the alpha female was happy when we got to the mating part.
We used GCO to put hardwood flooring in our house when we bought it.  Paid cash for a pretty nice discount as well as having them throw in installation (this was back in late '08)
What? No?!  I didn't know this existed.  THANK YOU!!
Did you get this in the UK?
Drakkhen for me.  I remember buying it at Macy's (yes, that Macy's) when it came out.  I was so excited.  I spent a week just trying to figure out how the f**k to play the game.  For some reason I still love that game even though it gets terrible reviews.
that is some terrible acting.
I was recently prescribed this due to panic attacks that were coming on because of my health and unknown status of what was going on with me.

I was prescribed 1mg and when I took it I never felt drugged, it just normalized me.   However, as of Wednesday I was able to alleviate a lot of my anxiety because I found out that my death isn't imminent as I thought.   I'm also on prozac long term and now am trying to restrict any ativan use to extreme cases where I can't talk myself down.   You really don't want to be on benzos for any extended amount of time.  You and your doctor should be working on a long term solution while using rx's like ativan and xanex for short term help.

To answer your question though, I've been taking 1mg almost every day for the past 2 weeks and until Wednesday and just stopped.  I didn't feel like I *needed* it.
What the fuck?  When I slow this down it looks like a rat comes up and hits her in the face?!
I don't know if you'll read this far but I literally am suffering from almost identical symptoms.

2 weeks ago I drove myself to the local E.R. because I had a pain in my chest (left side, close to heart).  They admitted me and they did a blood test, chest x-ray and EKG.   I'd had a similar attack a few days before and the enzymes that are in your blood after a heart attack didn't exist, my blood work (at least what they ran) came back fine.  The EKG showed a normal heart beat.

I'm still scheduled to take a stress test next week to make absolutely sure it's not my heart but both my primary physician and the E.R doctor figure I'm having anxiety/panic attacks and that I'm hyper-focusing on my chest.   I'm now on several meds to help aleviate when I'm feeling that my death is imminent but the stress test is certainly going to help me psyche that I'm not in cardiac distress.

I am on medications to help (ativan, prozac) but I know those cost money, especially if you don't have insurance.   When these attacks come on I just try and remind myself that I'm not really having a heart attack.  I completely focus on my breathing, taking slow deep breaths and counting them as I'm doing it.  That way my mind is preoccupied with those thoughts instead of panicing.

I just wanted to let you know you are certainly are not the only person dealing with this.
I got 90% and it was pretty simple.  The iphone has almost 0 depth of field, the images tend to be noisier and the contrast tends to suck.

Honestly though, if there was a shallow depth of field I knew it was the DSLR.
Go get an HIV test rule that out, that will put a lot of your mind at ease.

Yes, it sucks that you'd have to take medication to feel normal but its a step in the right direction.  You don't deserve to feel miserable so I'd at least consider giving it a try.
I wish I could upvote you more.

With people with panic attacks/anxiety that are related to things about your health - the most IMPORTANT thing you can do is rule out those things.  See the doctor and have tests run so you can rule that out.
Find something to sink your mind into right now.  Focus on your breathing and try and stop hyperventilating.   Breath in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds and then exhale.  count your breaths as you do this and do it over and over again for 5-10 minutes.

Consider going for a walk to get some fresh air.   Make sure you relax your shoulders and muscles where you feel tense.  A lot of people don't realize it but you end up having your shoulders hunched up like crazy and that isn't helping.

Again - try the breathing and find something that takes your mind off it.  

Lastly - you're not crazy - you had a legitimate reason with multiple repercussions to freak out.  Dealing with these panic attacks requires you to start assembling everything in your head logically and realizing it isn't the end of the world.  You did realize that there was a solution and you found it.

It was TOTALLY inappropriate for your boss to tweet about it so fuck giving her an apology.  We all handle stress/panic in a different way, she should have been more sensitive to the situation and handled it like an adult.

You're not an idiot, your reaction was not inappropriate.  You're human.  Just stop, breath, think and take moments to figure out what to do next in a situation.  Panic tends to be how we react to a situation and part of treating it is to try and control how you react to a situation.

Don't feel bad, everyone on here has their own level of panic and has dealt with the same thing as you.  You're doing fine.

Breath, try and relax. Listen to some music that may take your mind off it or watch a movie/tv.
Yes, it really hit me today that I *do not* have any desire to go to work.  And I love my job but it's killing me.  I'm not getting stuff done.  I actually find that Xanax makes me give less fucks about work than Adivan.   

Exercise really is one of the best ways to treat yourself.  I'm raring to go go exercise but my doc wants me to take a stress test to make sure it's not my heart (since chest pains when I panicked where the whole reason I'm here)
I'm somewhat like this.  Part of it for me is learning to accept what I can not change.  With the emails from your boss, you just need to take it at face value and not let it ruin your day.  If you know you've done the best you can - then you know that it's all you can do.  

It's also going to take some time to get used to taking criticism - I had a *really* hard time with this but over time I've learned to accept and use it to motivate me to do better. It's NOT easy but it IS manageable and will make you a better person.

I also think you're simply feeling ALL that work you've done to be a perfectionist coming to a head.  Be glad you're aware of it. Do NOT be afraid to talk to a therapist or a doctor (especially a D.O. vs an M.D.) about how your feeling.  

You'll get through this and you're not alone :)
Just this past week I got prescribed:

Adivan
Xanax
Trazadone
Prozac

Benzos are good short term, they aren't good long term. They are addictive and your body quickly builds a high tolerance against them.

Generally you should use the benzos while you're working on a long term solution to the problem.

I know exactly what you're going through and it *fucking* sucks. You should be proud of yourself for starting to take care of yourself and getting in shape.

I'd recommend practicing controlling your breathing as well as simple meditation.   I find instrumental and ambient music helps while I'm working or driving to keep my mind off of those other things.   It's important to find something that keeps your mind off.

The 'i don't give a fuck feeling' is nice and all but be careful, I'm finding myself less motivated to go to work.  Its why my doc put me on the prozac, to get back to 'normal'
Thank you.  I've been ashamed of this and until recently felt it was a weakness.  It does feel better to talk to people about everything.  After talking to my own mother I come to find out she's been suffering from panic attacks for years to.  This was both a relief to hear and a curse.  I don NOT want to be on some kind of meds the rest of my life.  My biggest goal is helping myself mentally and finding my center.
I'd definitely have it checked.  I'd been suffering for months and thought it was tension headaches since it would start in my temples and by the end of the day it was in my shoulders and back of head.  Ibuprofen and others would only do so much.   Had my blood pressure checked and it was HIGH (I'd had low blood pressure for over 30 years until that point).  He put me on blood pressure medicine and within a few days the headaches were lessened dramatically, now after about 2-3 weeks they're pretty much gone (and my BP is back in the normal range)
Have you checked your blood pressure?
Another person checking in that this happens for no reason
I had this same issue.  My doctor put me on Trazadone and it has helped dramatically.
If you're in the US and you're in a decent sized town that has a Realtor association you are probably throwing your money away with a lawyer.   Most associations produce the transaction forms that are used by agents that have been gone over with a fine tooth comb.   A brokerage or even individual agent could have some kind of form in there too but generally they are extraneous and won't prevent the closing from happening.

Also, IMHO appraisers are also a waste of money unless you're a bank or investor.   Use any one of the real estate sites online to pull comparable values.  Even use your agent - they should be able to generate a CMA (Comparative Market Analysis) within a few minutes.  If the seller wants too much, counter, if they don't accept - move on.  

Where I do agree is a home inspection - you get what you pay for so you should pony up for this service.   I especially recommend inspectors on *new construction* and even moreso with tract homes.    Most people assume a new house is going to be perfectly built and majority of time it's not.    Builders and their subs cut corners every step of the way and most of the time the county/city inspectors sign off *a floorplan* and not on each individual house.  Lets say there is 50 houses being built, 10 of which are the same floorplan - the city/county inspector just signs off on those plans and not each individual house.

Keep in mind, when you're *buying* a house you shouldn't be spending any money out of pocket for their services.  Ask them for CMA's, ask them to show you the house multiple times, ask to see similar properties.  Do your own research.   There are plenty of GOOD Realtors out there.
You know, someone tried something similar to this about 70 years ago....

In all seriousness - it's a terrible idea.  Some of 'those people' you're referring to contributed a lot to society.    You wouldn't be advancing the human race, you'd be doing it a disservice.  People would live longer consuming more resources since there would be no worry about dying prematurely from disease, etc.    As a dog owner, this idea is no different than putting down my german shepherd because he has a higher chance than other dogs of getting hip dysplasia.

Also, as a ginger, if any of you bastards want to get rid of us - Good Luck.
I don't quite feel the same way as everyone else about this.  The fact that 2 other cases exist out there really makes me think this is par for the course for DR and DRTV.   I'm sure there are others out there that didn't know about this story and just continue to use their camera as normal.

The long winded reasoning provided by the PR person just sounded like an excuse.  The good news is that they will most likely stop doing this now that this came out.

Just think about it.  If it was ONE person I'd believe DR. But now there is 3 cases of the camera being used and then wrapped back up perfectly and shipped out to the buyer?

Wow.  These are some great shots. You've got a good eye for composition.

Michael Jordan is only 50?  I'm 34. He's 50?  FUCKING 50? Just 16 years older than me? Jesus Christ I'm fucking OLD.

Edit: Get off my lawn.
I like the photo and I do think the subject works.

However, she's in the lower two thirds and there really isn't anything that interesting in the upper third.  I would have placed the subject in the top third a little more and perhaps used a different focal length to get more DoF.  I would have also moved slightly so that one larger tree trunk wasn't distracting.

That said, the subjects expression really draws me in and the plugins you used to get the color do work.  Good job - I can't wait to see more photos from you.
Would you mind scanning it? Would love to read it.
Have you considered using a wider angle lens?
The lens is meant to depict a still camera and the 'triangle' is meant to depict a video/film camera.
I got to the 3rd/4th photo and realized the HDR effect was too much.   Are you actually doing HDR (multiple exposures) or are you trying to get the effect of it using a plugin?

The composition of your photos seems good, but that HDR effect needs to come down several notches.
If you were driving that vehicle when you got the ticket, good luck.

If it was parked somewhere you could possibly get away with a waiver that says the vehicle wasn't used at that time.  The forms are available at the DMV website or at the actual DMV if you go there.

I have to assume you weren't driving it because generally they'd tow your car.  Expired registration = no insurance (it doesn't matter if you had insurance at the time, your insurance is invalid without the registration).

When I dealt with this last year the employee at the DMV was like "So.. you didn't drive this vehicle.. RIGHT? You have Form X... RIGHT?".  Didn't pay any fees (on 2 vehicles)
This has huge potential - huge!  The hardest thing is going to be getting all that data in there, and keeping it up to date.

Have you tried placing the SIM from the lost phone into YOUR phone?  At least that way you could potentially get the phone number.
Try hoot suite.  I use it for this and it's been great.
The only thing worse than living in the town where this fucking ad exists is logging on to Reddit and finding it here, reposted monthly.
Not a fan of fisheye but I do have the VCLECU1 and looking at this new lens it has the right threading as well as the mark to match up the adapters.  I'd be floored if Sony abandoned the adaptors along with the 16mm.

Honestly, I've been really happy with my 16mm+VCLECU1.  I just know it's a crapshoot in terms of the quality on them with some good and some bad.
These aren't old boards painted over btw.   Most of the time whomever has commissioned these boards has run hundreds of them for marketing. All their doing is replacing some of the top and bottom sheets with custom graphics - in this case Grand Marnier.   Any of the smaller snowboard manufacturers would be generally happy to make these for you.  Locally for me Sentury Snowboards creates custom boards all the time for people and they're using the same materials as their other boards, just different graphics.
Your white balance is completely off.  I'd either set your white balance or set it to Auto (but may still give that blue cast).    Looks like the SD14 can shoot in RAW so I'd definitely do that so you can fix some of these things in post.

Personally I think the problem with your picture is the subject in general.  The sky is unexciting (not your fault) as is the snow on the ground so I don't know how interesting the shot could be unless you got closer to the tree itself.  The houses are a little distracting and overall the image seems a little underexposed.  Perhaps if the shot was in landscape instead of portrait it would have been different and if the tree was in either the lower third or top third of the picture instead of close to the middle.
What lens(es) are you using with your NEX?
I was able to get a SEL16F28 yesterday and also got a UWA for it.   The 16 by itself wasn't amazing but I really love having the UWA on it, its fantastic.
Nice shot!  The sky and the trees almost make it look IR.
What I've come to realize is that it's very easy to spot a good photo and a bad one.  Almost instantly you're going to make a decision on that photo.

99.999% of these people may own equipment but can't compose a decent photo at all.    I want to tell these people, if you can't take a good photo on your iPhone, what makes you think your DSLR is going to make it any better? A good photographer is much more than a good camera.

I have one of these friends too - she has the financial means to buy the latest and greatest, and then all she does is post these shitty hdr shots with vignetting of her kids all day long.  Then I noticed she set up a photography facebook page and somehow convinced a local homeless shelter to let her take pictures of their kids with Santa and give them prints for free.... don't even get me started.
I'd argue that it's also Samsung's business plan.
As someone who's been on a highwinds provider for 8+ years.   

No.
If it is their 2wire RG unit (usually a big grey or black device with 2wire and maybe an AT&T modem on it) then they are correct, it can't.  

If it is a small DSL modem then it can be used on some other DSL providers.
I like LuLou's (slightly older crowd and its not cheap) or Johnny's in the northwest.  Johnny's is some off the best Italian food I've ever eaten and LuLou's has some of the best contemporary food (and great cocktails) I've had in this area.
I really don't think the 16mm lens is great by itself.  With the UWA or fisheye adapter however, it's a much better lens.   The UWA adapter essentially gives you a 12mm focal length which will give you more than the 18 vs the 16 by itself which is only a 2mm (and not massively noticeable) difference.

I didn't get the 16 as part of my kit so I'm in the opposite boat as you -  looking to pick it up with the UWA after having an opportunity to use a friends a few months back.  My issue is that the $250 retail price is pretty steep and I'm concerned about the build quality of used/older ones but I digress.

I'd say if you want to take more advantage of that lens, get the UWA.


Most videos I shoot really focus around a person that I'm interviewing and therefore the setup works for me:

Sony NEX-5N

iPhone

iMovie

iTalk app (free)

Audio-Technica ATR-3350 Lavalier Mic.

TRRS to Mic Jack adapter (needed for above Mic to work with any phone with a TRRS jack)


Then I used this tutorial guys tutorial to match everything up:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gVL-pMv1FM

Mainly I just use the triple clap for sound.  Fortunately the NEX-5N does record sound so I can either match up the wave forms (easiest) but if I didn't have an onboard mic (NEX-6?) you should be able to still be able to match the visuals to the audio.

Honestly, it's really pretty easy and the audio is MUCH better than the mic built into the 5N.    This solution was using stuff I already had so it saved me some coin over buying something like the Zoom H4N.


Keep in mind my setup is for recording voice, interview style.  There are a billion options for mic's that you could use with a smartphone or just an external recorder.

Would you mind sharing what other apps you use?  Such as the slow shutter app?

Thanks and nice shots!
Investment and retirement.  Put some money away in savings in case of emergency but as long as you have a career that you can be gainfully employed with I feel that trying to make a big savings account isn't worth it.    Putting the money in 401ks or even SIMPLE IRA's with medium risk at your age would be a good idea.

Avoid credit card debt.
Don't be car poor or house poor.
This will sound lame but the Sony NEX-5N camera totally changed how I felt about photography.  I had various canon SLRs and before a family trip last summer I sold the Canon and lenses and got the 5N.   The size and lightness along with interchangeable lenses and good image quality totally sold me on mirrorless.   Less kit makes it easier to carry around which equals more pictures.

They aren't for everyone but I'm 100% more into photography than I have been the past few years.    I know I'll get hate for this but give it a few years and I think mirrorless cameras will usurp DSLRs.
Sure enough - he edited this original post and added his facebook page...
While I admire your efforts in weight loss - this post seems like the perfect way to drum more interest up in your book/website......
I recently sold my DSLR and lenses to get into the Sony NEX system.   I can't tell you how big of a fan I am to have interchangeable lenses on such a small body.    It was a huge difference going from a full size canon SLR to this in terms of bulk and weight.

I've also found that for the level of photography I do that this system works out great.   Sony makes some decent lenses and I can hop on Amazon and order an adapter if I want to use another brand.

I'd take a serious look at the some of the mirrorless systems out there.
I got the 55-210 for Christmas and have been very happy with it.

My next purchase will be the 16mm + UWA.

I feel like if I have the 16mm, the kit 18-55 and the 55-210 then I'm covered for 99% of photos I want to shoot.
You're (we're?) going to want the ultra wide conversion lens (Sony VCL-ECU1) to go along with the SEL16F28.
What wrist strap is that?
I have the 18-55 kit and the 55-210 and I freaking love the 55-210. For many of the shots I do it works great with fantastic depth of field and the OSS at full zoom is fantastic.

My next purchase will be the 16mm w/ ultrawide converter - that'll cover me for 99% of situations.
After some digging around - you're correct for disk based games for sure.  It looks like (most) 3rd party games that are downloaded will also give club Nintendo games.

That saddens me.   DQ has to be one of my favorite franchises.
Seems pretty fitting that Joey Fatone had a burrito for a child.
From the acticle:

>Dragon Quest X on the Wii U will be released ***worldwide*** in March 2013.
Take a look at these:  http://www.criterioncellular.com/repeaters/index.html

There's lots of different vendors and no legal issues with these since all you are doing is boosting the service indoors and not broadcasting your own signal on the same frequency.

I've seen some people use a microcell/femtocell in these situations but usually it's not a good idea since you're usually very limited on the amount of users that can connect to the device.

As someone who is married to a Nurse and watched her go through school where CNA's also got training, I always questioned why people bothered to be a CNA - you literally do most of the shitty work for shitty pay.  It took 2 years for my wife to be an RN (with an ASN) (vs. 1 year of training for CNA I think) and her first job is paying $60K/yr - it's not a mind blowing salary but few other professions will pay out that much w/ an associates.   

I'd argue that a CNA would be too hard of a job to hold down WHILE you are going to school as well and for the money you make it literally wouldn't be worth it.
I have 100Mbit cable connection and am sometimes able to saturate the line using highwinds.  I'm on the west coast.  My Sab is set at 100 connections.
Perhaps the best thing to do with these is apply them to your own vehicle and then park like an asshole.  Then, everyone who get's bent out of shape about you parking inconsiderably laughs when they see it and don't give it another thought. Meanwhile you can always get away with parking like a douche because people think you've already been chastised for it.
Head over to:  http://www.myusage.att.com/ and login using your AT&T username/password.

If you login and get a graph of your usage - you are in a market where AT&T enforces caps.

If you login and get something like "the tool is not ready for you/your area at this time" or similar - congrats - you are in a market where AT&T is not monitoring caps (this seems to be more common).

AT&T generally only enforces caps in markets that their competition also does.
While I appreciate your efforts to fill people in as to what's going on I'm not entirely sure you understand how Usenet works. 

Also - other than the USPs - few if any people are in to this to make money.  The cost of bandwidth and storing the data alone add up.
I have to LOL to the fact that Morganelli has truly helped accelerate development in the next generation of indexers and posting along with exposing himself and his contacts instead of keeping his business under the radar.  Since I'm fairly certain his team is probably that of himself and maybe 1 other person I doubt he will keep up.  Had he kept his mouth shut instead of boasting like Augustus Gloop - he would have quietly made much more of an impact than he will now.
It'd be nice to figure out what the links are to download the Wii U firmware.  That way I can see how fast it comes down to my PC vs. my Wii U.

When the updates have come out I assume I'll have it quickly since I have a 100Mbit connection.  3 hours later I realize that I'm wrong.
This makes his post on twitter all that more interesting:

Joe Morganelli ‏@Morganelli
@dan_sinn yes it started personal.I watched a good friend lose house/wife/family due to piracy.He lost everything he had.

I'm pretty sure he was talking about himself - when he had to pay up $15,000,000
The very copyright holders he says he protects are also the same people he owes $15M to.
Did this joke on my 13 year old daughters.  Still epic.
It works fine for me (other than the front page).  There's content that's been added as of 25 minutes before my post.

Look - most of these sites - especially ones that were conveniently built into scripts such as CouchPotato and Sickbeard are going to be targeted.   When you have sites like Gizmodo and Lifehacker running stories on how to access all this stuff, it painted huge targets on the backs of some of these sites.

The reality is that some of these that are still around are either going to shutdown out of fear or become invite only.   Fortunately with newznab being available other sites will certainly pop up.   I'd only truly get concerned when content start disappearing from Usenet providers.
Another person interested here, thanks!
I still see people trying to make a profit on Craigslist and they never sell.   I just post ads on there with the system at retail price along with a list of places I've found them in stock recently.  People are still trying to sell deluxe bundles for $100+ more than retail locally.
I'll second UnlockFusion.   I unlocked my 4S via AT&T right before the 5 came out.  It took about a week for it to happen but it didn't cost anything.  It's important to note I was mid contract when I did this (I didn't have to wait to fulfill my contract).  It was free but it also took a week.

I used UnlockFusion a few days ago and it cost me a whopping $2.10 and took a few hours (they say they'll have it done within 24).  They also claim that you can do it regardless of your status with the existing provider.   It's probably easier for you to go this route rather than going through AT&T (who I don't think are going to unlock a phone that has an unfulfilled contract).
Looks like a Tanooki - at least the Nintendo version.
After assuming you were full of shit by the post you made yesterday - I went ahead and spent the whopping $2.10 on eBay and sure enough - when I restored it was unlocked.  Pretty happy.  Not sure why the OP and you are being downvoted.
Another UnlockFusion user here.  Paid $2.10 on eBay and had it unlocked within an hour.   

My only concern (and I have no evidence of this) is that this is a loophole that will some how get closed in the future.  However I'm not sure if Apple can relock your phone.
This is nice and all but why doesn't someone just make a bigger battery that fits in the existing battery compartment?
He's in the UK.

It's region locked just like DVDs are.  EUR region games can only be played on EUR region consoles.   What TV is used doesn't matter too much unless you're using an analog connection and even then, many TV's sold in Europe can handle NTSC, PAL and SECAM.
I see you figured it out but just so you know - Neo6 and ProLogic are 'simulated' surround sound.     The Wii U can ONLY do PCM surround.
The game needs to support surround sound.  Zombie U is the only one I'm personally aware of that has surround.   The menus and NSMBU do not have surround.
Took me a second to realize those black boxes are original Wii's and not deluxes.  I have to say it's pretty par for the course having all the basic units.  I almost wonder if they'll go the way of the dinosaur before the end of 2013.
$750?   Goodbye my iPhone 5!  I was bored with you anyways...
I understand not having MMS sucks but I've got to be honest.  You're using an unsupported phone on an unsupported network (I get that it rides on AT&T).  It's readily known that you may and probably will have issues when you do this.  This isn't Apple's fault.

Hell - if you want to bring unlocked phones into this conversation, even Apple mentions on their website:

>The unlocked iPhone works only on ** supported** GSM networks, such as AT&T in the U.S. When you travel internationally, you can also use a micro-SIM card from a local GSM carrier. The unlocked iPhone will not work with CDMA carriers such as Verizon Wireless or Sprint.
And only in Canada:  http://techland.time.com/2012/11/27/wii-mini-outed-by-nintendo-as-canada-exclusive-wont-connect-to-internet/
Reading this some people are having a hard time comprehending the use of this.

Please let me explain.  Some of us, including myself, have used the existing charger for the cradle and in my case, the charger is no longer accessible for me to use to play and charge anymore.   Because of this issue, cables like this are perfect since I can keep my charger in place and use a different cable to keep on playing should I run out of battery.

Can you use the 'pick up at store' option?
I'm not watching my receiver like a hawk but I've yet to experience surround with Mario at all.   Unfortunately I still haven't opened Nintendoland, ZombieU and Sonic.
In for 4, THANK YOU!!

Edit:  My experience was strange btw.  In Chrome I could add them to the cart but it told me out of stock (even after clearing my cache and logging out).  I fired it up in Safari and was able to complete the transaction and pay for them.  Now I just have to go to the store.
Take a look at this link:  http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=500865

I have NSMBU and NintendoLand of which I've only even opened NSMBU and haven't experienced and surround with it - although in fairness I realized my receiver wasn't set to auto-detect on the input I used. .  I'll probably pick up ZombieU today.  I'll come back here and report back if I get anything.   The receiver I have is a Pioneer VSX-9040TXH.
I think part of it is that the since the Gamecube, Nintendo has been marketing these consoles as Family oriented vs. Sony and MSFT marketing their consoles primarily to the young adult crowd.

To me you also have 2 distinct types of console gamers these days.  You've got the FPS crowd and you've got the casual gaming crowd.  There is plenty of crossover there but that's what I see out there.   Generally those who aren't into more casual gaming tend to crap on it (without trying it first).  That said, my son (16) who generally lives for FPS', loves playing on the U.

As someone who owns all 3 'current' generation of consoles - one is no better than the other - I own all 3 just because there are games I love on each one.
I honestly expect the Wii U to be 'limited availability' through Christmas vs. sold out.

Prices on Craigslist are dropping quickly.  I picked my deluxe up at Target last night and there were several more (the 3 Targets around me had received stock).  Launch day demand was high but I think you're starting to see things slow down.  I actually think some people who remember the Wii launch are just saying screw it and waiting.
Targets in Reno and sparks in Nevada received a new shipment today. If you're in that area go hunt. I picked up a deluxe this evening.  
Targets in my area (Reno, NV) got a new shipment today.  There are several within a 20 mile radius of me that all had 7-9 received earlier today.

Edit: Call target.
This is fantastic news.  For me that means it will take MONTHS.
I wouldn't trust anything over the phone.  Walk in and check for yourself.   Half the time when you call a Walmart or a Target they just tell you whatever they assume.     When I got a basic at Walmart, 3 people told me they were out of stock when, in fact, they were sitting in the cabinet.
Honestly - I think if you're diligent about keeping up on your local retailers stock by visiting them - you may get somewhere.

At least locally, the scalpers aren't having an easy time.   On CL I see deluxes sit there at $450, day after day.  Personally I bought a basic but haven't opened it yet unless I just can't get a deluxe in the next week or so.   I have however put it on Craigslist for the retail cost + local sales tax.  This has pushed the asking prices on Craigslist down much to my amusement.  

I think the initial rush is there as with all these items but I think they'll come into stock sooner than everyone thinks.
Road will remain a 4 lane road as Veterans is now.   This road is projected to carry as much traffic as McCarran does so it'll really only be a pain during peak hours.
As someone who lives near Veterans and South Meadows, this sucks.  However I've known about it for years.

I am looking forward to how crazy easy it will be to get from S. Meadows to Legends, the Marina, etc.   I'm hoping it will quicken the commute from this area to 80E instead of the freeway.
What's interesting is that when you first posted that link the deluxe was an option.  In the past 5-10 minutes you can now only select the basic.
The basic is in stock - the deluxe is not, even with that bundle.
In an act of desperation for my kids I bought a basic so at least, come Christmas there would be a Wii U underneath the tree.   I'd love to do this but (obviously) concerned about getting ripped off.

How would you conduct this?

Love that picture.
I've been dealing with the same thing with my iPhone + iPad.  It kills me that Apple gives you 5GB for all devices vs. 5GB per device.

For me I found getting all my videos out of my camera roll, deleting my old back up and re-backing-up fixed it.   Videos were taking up an insane amount of space and still taking up space even after I thought I deleted them.
If you're doing someone where someone is going to profit from the transaction (other than you) you're gonna get fucked.

I've always sold my items on Craigslist.   I have never, and will never buy ANYTHING on Craigslist but I sell everything on there.

I sold my unlocked 32GB 4S on Craigslist for $450 the day AFTER the 5 came out.

Other than the original iPhone that I paid $600 for I've never been out of pocket to purchase the latest iPhone, I've always been able to sell my old phone for more than the new one (on contract) is going for.

 I'll only sell for cash and always just meet people at a Starbucks or whatever and I have a counterfeit pen/uv.   I also have that person agree to the price before we even meet so there is no last minute low-balling.   Yes - it may be more effort but it's generally worth it. 


I tracked down a similar font that won't set you back $$.

Doing BS in Health Informatics here too.  I'm a little down because I'm having a hard time getting through this with my job + kids/family but I'm trying to crunch through it.
I've found that if you're looking for a Verizon or Sprint iPhone 5, chances are you can walk in today and buy one.

If you're looking for an AT&T iPhone 5 however you're going to have a mixed bag of what's in stock.  My local Apple store gets shipments almost daily but AT&T phones go quick, especially (suprisingly) the 32 and 64GB varieties.
I am not an iPhone dev.  However if memory serves, developers can run unsigned code on dev iphones.  Therefore it shouldn't be too diffucult to get Cydia and Installous installed and running on an iPhone.  How functional either program is, I don't know.  
Can we get a subreddit for open wounds?  I know I'm weird but I find them fascinating.
Believe it or not: Bad Credit > No Credit.  Even Bankruptcy > No Credit.
If memory serves the Apple store app isn't even a retina app or ipad app either.  I wouldn't hold my my breath.
My iPhone 5 got delivered last Friday at my office.   I was excited and opened it up to check it out.  It was a think of beauty.. I pulled off the front plastic and then the back.  That is when I pulled the phone up and out of my hand.  It fell to the ground by way of bouncing off my desk and then hitting a metal picture frame resting against the wall.   Nice scratch on the back.

Best thing I ever did!  Now I don't care about every little blemish.  I suggest you do the same.  Relax.

Also, AppleCare+
