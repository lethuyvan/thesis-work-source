Se os negros são a maioria de baixa renda, e negros de alta renda não têm a mesma dificuldade que os de classes mais baixas, então a cota social resolve o problema sim. E sem negar ajuda a quem precisa mas não nasceu com a quantidade suficiente de melanina.

So, racism is only racism if someone dies. Gotcha.
So, racism is only racism if it's in a large scale or hurts people severely? Simply yelling the N-word at a black guy isn't racist then?
Racism is a crime in many countries. Just saying.

The problem here is the double standard. Yes, racism against blacks is way more widespread than racism against whites, but that doesn't mean one of them should be more acceptable. The more anti-white racism is seemed as okay because it's not as big of an issue, the more it becomes normalized and the more it can potentially grow to systematic levels.

Prejudice isn't quantifiable. One bigot is already one bigot too many.
In America. Compare that tho what white people went through recently in South Africa or Zimbabwe. 
Someone could yell "Nazi" while pointing to a guy in full Wehrmacht uniform heiling Hitler with a swastika tatooed in his forehead Manson-style, and I'd still be like "you sure he didn't just disagree with you" at this point.

E qual seria este? Porque não consigo pensar em uma coisa que elas fazem que o critério social já não resolva.

A diferença é que, enquanto as cotas sociais são baseadas em fatos facilmente observáveis (até um idiota consegue ver que ricos têm vida mais fácil do que pobres), as cotas raciais são baseadas em estereótipos, generalizações e, sim, racismo. Sua necessidade implicaria que os negros têm mais dificuldade de entrar nas universidades não por falta de recursos, mas porque são negros e, portanto, menos capazes que brancos. Ela discrimina os negros ao tratá-los com condescendência, e discrimina os brancos pobres ao negá-los a ajuda necessária baseado em nada além de cor da pele.

Até sua própria aplicação é impossível sem apelar para métodos racistas de classificação de etnias (a [One-Drop Rule](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-drop_rule), por exemplo), visto que é fácil burlar um sistema de auto-identificação.

Se o problema é preconceito, bastaria não informar a raça do candidato às pessoas que corrigem as provas e o problema seria resolvido.
Esse é um dos problemas principais com as cotas. Ou você permite abuso, ou você usa métodos racistas pra classificar pessoas por etnia. Não há meio termo. É um sistema falho por natureza.
Se já são cotas sociais, o aspecto de raça não seria supérfluo?

Okay friend, let me explain something to you since you seem to be new here. Hebephilia is NOT the same thing as pedophilIa. I'm sick and tired of you trolls popping up everywhere and spreading BLATANT misinformation. In many countries hebephilia is considered normal and healthy . Human beings have a natural attraction to girls who are going through puberty. Being attracted to girls who are pre-pubescent is fucking sick and disgusting, but only in the US does there seem to be an unwarranted taboo around a healthy and normal condition. My head hurts. I'm just trying to get my real life back.

In the final battle, Jon Snow is hit in the face by NK's sword.

Jon wakes up in a fancy bed at the Red Keep, his crown hanging on one of the posts. He looks outside, and there's half-Stark, half-Targaryen banners everywhere. It was all a dream. He's the rightful king of Westeros.

"Come back to bed, Your Grace", a female voice says.

And Jon runs to the arms of his beloved Daenerys... but, instead, he finds Sansa, wearing nothing but the queen's crown.

He unsheathes Longclaw and kills himself.
Yesterday I was watching season 7 and I saw Jon snow riding a horse and wielding a sword. What kind of generic fantasy nonsense is that? ^/s
It's like reverse sagging.
Not exactly. Yeah, it has been overused until it lost its meaning (like any other buzzword), but it basically means "a person who says good things not out of a genuine desire to do good things, but to look good to others".

A good example would be the company who put up the "Fearless Girl" statue in front of the Wall Street bull.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Jimmy Neutron - Boy Genius. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Carl's love of llamas, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Jimmy Neutron truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Jimmy’s existential catchphrase “Gotta Blast”, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Steve Oedekerk’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Jimmy Neutron tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

THIS. If the problem is that cultural elements from non-white cultures are discriminated aginst, then wouldn't shaming white people for taking part in them otherize those elements even more, by making them even more of a "[insert culture here] thing"?

This seem to be a trend in the SJW* way of thinking : the idea of "If I can't have it, no one can". It's an incredibly childish concept of justice that does nothing to make the world better.

You treat men and women differently and call that "equality". Terminology my ass.
You can't achieve equality by treating people unequally. Men and women should be *partners*, not *allies*. Fight together against the sexism that's making the lives of both genders worse instead of focusing on one side entirely while the other just serves as cannon fodder.

But you know what? Fuck that. I refuse to be a part of a movement that excludes me based on nothing but my genitals. Not even as an "ally".

I guess that's the problem: they're just teenagers. It's not unusual for kids that age, particularly male, to see getting laid ASAP as the ultimate achievement. They chat about how big the girls' boobs are, they brag about how many women they fucked at parties (even though they're just lying 99% of the time) and bully virgin kids to ostracism. 

To normal people, that's just a phase. Once they mature, they start to see sex as just a part of life rather than the meaning of it all, and become functional adults. But incels  internalize those childish views and become more and more bitter. Since, in their minds, not having sex is the source of their misery, of course the women who refuse to fuck the depression out of them are EVIL. And the more time they spend surrounded by a circlejerk of bitter virgins with the same toxic mindset, the more they believe this shit.

This is why I despise the incel community. It takes normal yet outcast teenagers in need of love and validation and turn them into shrieking trolls spreading hate and negativity.

>accidentally misgendering someone does not carry any penalty - but if you're maliciously and intentionally calling someone by their wrong pronoun as a political act, that's kinda fucked up, IMO

Agreed, but how do we know for sure? What's stopping an ill-intentioned trans person (or even a cis person posing as trans) from claiming your misgendering was intentional? Similarly, what's stopping a legit transphobe to pretend an intentional misgendering was accidental?

That's one of the problems with regulating speech. It gives way too much opportunity for abuse, since intent is something only the speaker knows for sure. It's much easier to try and be polite and thoughtful while instructing people to do the same.

I think the joke would be of better taste if the punchline was "And that's how Karen found out she's transgender". The implication would go from "trans women are actually men" to "Karen is a biological woman and identifies as a man".

>Their legs were straight and their feet were like a calf's hoof, and they gleamed like burnished bronze. Under their wings on their four sides were human hands. As for the faces and wings of the four of them, their wings touched one another; their faces did not turn when they moved, each went straight forward. As for the form of their faces, each had the face of a man; all four had the face of a lion on the right and the face of a bull on the left, and all four had the face of an eagle. Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each had two touching another being, and two covering their bodies. And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit was about to go, they would go, without turning as they went. In the midst of the living beings there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches darting back and forth among the living beings. The fire was bright, and lightning was flashing from the fire. And the living beings ran to and fro like bolts of lightning.

That's the biblical description of a cherub. Yup, those plump naked baby angels you see in paintings.

I was just giving you an example of Feminist extremism that predates the modern alt-right. But radfems existed even before the word "Feminism" was coined. Suffragettes have promoted actual misandry, such as the White Feather campaign, to shame men *and boys* into risking their lives in the war, or that time they tried to ban condoms to prevent men from having reproductive rights. And they also used downright terrorist tactics, such as bombs.

["A Soviet weekly newspaper today published the most detailed accounting of Stalin's victims yet presented to a mass audience here, indicating that about 20 million died in labor camps, forced collectivization, famine and executions. (...) In all, [historian Roy Medvedev] calculated about 40 million victims of Stalin's repressions, including those arrested, driven from their land or blacklisted.."
](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/04/world/major-soviet-paper-says-20-million-died-as-victims-of-stalin.html)

But, sure, Josef Stalin was a fucking saint.
>First, communism was active much longer in different populations.

All of them somehow ending up as dictatorships that violated countless human rights.

>Second, the Nazis had plans to kill off 20M to 30M Slavs by starvation. They just didn't get the chance to implement it. 

You're right. Can't compare both. The Nazis attempted to commit genocide by starving people to death. [The Soviets were successful.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor)

TBH I'd have no problem with Feminists not fighting for men's rights if they just admitted they're a women's rights movement and stopped pretending they're a movement for general gender equality. 

MRAs never address women's rights issues, but that's because it's always been about men. It would be like expecting Greenpeace to include LGBT rights on their activism even though it has nothing to do with protecting the environment. 

Feminists, however, claim they care about men but do nothing to show it, and even go out of their way to infringe on men's rights. This hypocrisy is what I have a problem with.
Men have issues that remain unadressed by society, but that doesn't mean women don't have issues of their own.

What radical MRAs and radical Feminists alike don't understand is that there is no patriarchy or matriarchy; just different kinds of sexism that affect men, women and/or both.

"Feminism means equality. That's the only true definition."

"How about those who don't follow the definition?"

"You see, there are actually many definitions of Feminism..."
Okay then, let's play that game.

The definition of Christian is "one who professes belief in the teachings of Jesus Christ". Jesus said "love thy neighbor", therefore the Westboro Baptist Church isn't Christian.

The definition of "PETA" is "People fir the Ethical Treatment of Animals", therefore those assholes who kill stray dogs aren't truly PETA members.

The definition of "boat" is "a vessel capable of floating on water", therefore the Titanic wasn't a true boat.

When you kiss a woman, your tongue gets in contact with her saliva, which is filled with feminine hormones like estrogen that make you less manly. Kissing dudes, however, allows you to take a bit of their testosterone with the saliva, making you manlier.

Kissing girls is gay. Kissing guys is manly. That's just science.

Hypocrisy was probably the thing Jesus hated the most. Half the things he said, particularly the most inflammatory statements, can be boiled down to "Don't be a hypocrite".

I don't have a problem with Feminism per se, but what it has become. Its demonization of men, its dogmatic approach, its increasingly authoritarian tendencies, its black-and-white worldview, its obsession with aglutinating every single equality movement under the sun in order to hog the spotlight... Not to mention that a few things in Feminist Theory seem really hard to believe, exaggerated or misrepresented intentionally, such as the Patriarchy, rape culture or the wage gap.

I'm bi, and I guess for me it was a slow process rather than an "oh shit I like dudes" moment. My attraction to men started up as something very low key, like a strange feeling when I saw an atttractive guy that my brain still didn't register as sexual attraction. That "feeling" then grew more and more until it hit me that it was the same thing I felt towards women I was interested in.
Nah, North Korea isn't really Communism cuz they use money or something. s/
Because he was a leader of the Communist Party? Because his system of govnment was Communist? Because he defined himself as Marxist and Leninist?

Just because someone contradicts the principles of an ideology, doesn't mean they don't subscribe to said ideology. The Westboro Baptist Church goes against Jesus' "Love Thy Neighbor" philosophy, yet they're still Christians.

It's important to notice that the ones claiming Stalin wasn't a Communist are Communists themselves - people who'd benefit from not being associated with him. Whenever someone brings up the positive side of Stalinist USSR (their role in the Allied victory in WWII, putting a man in space for the first time in history, etc) these same scholars will define Stalinism as Communism again in order to take credit for those achievements.
Stalin was an extremist, but a Communist extremist. He doesn't stop being Communist just because some rando on Reddit said so.

The DNC lost the moment they picked Hillary. She had no charisma, was involved in some pretty shady stuff, was connected to a president lots of people disliked and her attempts to be relatable to millenials were so laughable they became a meme. The ony two things going for her were the fact that she's female and her opponent being a guy like Trump. You can only run with those two so long before people ask themselves what else this candidate has to offer.
Okay, here's a novel concept:

Funny how, in eight years of Obama administration, neither of the people saying "you hate Trump? Go to Mexico!" have moved to Mexico themselves.
Problem is that we tend to associate those things with an specific gender, so a trans person wearing them is an easy way to avoid misgendering. Without gendered clothing we'd have to go full Professor Oak and ask everyone what gender they are upon meeting them.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Eminem. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of street slang most of the jokes will go over a typical listener's head. There’s also Slim Shady's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The stans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these rhymes, to realise that they’re not just cool- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Eminem truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Em's line “Vomit on his sweater already, Mom's spaghetti” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Marshal Mathers' genius wit unfolds itself on their Spotify playlists. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Revival tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Why be a king when you can be a God? 😎

are there people who actually thinking sucking dick is gay?

1. you're sharing protein
2. you're admiring masculine physique
3. being in the vacinity of other high testosterone males increases your own testosterone

eating pussy is gay because you're litterally slurping down estrogen. and long term relationships have been proven to lower testosterone.

spartans had gay orgies all the time and they were the height of masculinity. you bet they were at least fondling eachothers test producers.

>Why is it unreasonable to notice that the only group which would rape me, would be men? I don't understand, can you explain why it's unreasonable to be afraid?

First of all, because *no, it isn't*. Newsflash, women can rape as well, both men and women. Even if your attitude wasn't pure bigotry, it's still useless to protect you against rape, and I don't think you're willing to live your life paranoid of every single person you find.

>The problem isn't the emotional response women have to rapists, the problem is that too many men are rapists.

The percentage of men who rape is still extremely small. Most of the men you'll find in your lifetime aren't rapists, and the vast majority considers rapists the worst kind of scum.

>Notice how you frame the situation in order to place all the burden of a systematic problem onto women's emotional response to a crime that someone else chose to do:

Oh, FFS, no one is blaming you for your rape, we're just telling you there's no excuse for bigotry no matter what. You can bet I'll call out a 9/11 survivor if he starts saying all Muslims are terrorists and my buddy Ahmed is secretly a member of ISIS.

>**A** man raped me.

There you go. Out of the billions of men on the planet, one of them raped you, and you chose to base your entire perception of men on this one monster even though we're all individuals with individual thoughts and personalities.

The thing is, rape is a crime considered especially heinous by society and the authorities, either be almost as bad, as bad or even worse than murder depending on who you ask. The consequences of false rape accusations are massive, and the potential for malicious use of those accusations is big. It's important to protect rape victims and punish rapists, but it's also important to make sure no innocent person gets a punishment they don't deserve. Especially since it allows real rapists to roam free.

In the end of the day, a democratic law system should be based on the principle that everyone is innocent until proven otherwise, and there's no reason why rape should be an exception.

What you need to understand is that Deadpool is like those racist comics from the 40's or ridiculously campy comics from the 60's: a product of his time. He's a parody of the same edgy sociopathic antiheroes with leather uniforms, big-ass guns and Mary Sue tendencies the 90's were infamous for. Besides, his 4th wall breaking was somewhat original back then.

He's not a bad character, just severely outdated.
It's also embarrassing. What genius looked at a bathroom stall some day and thought "you know, what if I could pee where everyone in the restroom can watch it?"
Imagine a person who was attacked by a black guy and hates all black people as a result. Then claims that "it's not that all blacks are criminals, but *enough* blacks are". Would you see that as reasonable? Would you accuse those who call them racist of gaslighting?

Look, I'm sorry you were raped. I hope neither you nor anyone else has to go through such a terrible experience again, and I hope your rapist has a special place in Hell reserved for him. But living a life of hatred, paranoia and fear can't be healthy. Get psychological help. It'll make your life better.
Imagine being so secure of your sexuality that you think a fucking bean will make you gay.

What I see constantly is an aversion to the "listen and believe" culture that not only fucks up the lives of the falsely accused, but banalizes rape itself, making it harder for real victims to get help.

Jesus was actually pretty pro-women for his time. He took a promiscuous woman and arguably a prostitute as one of his followers and stopped an adulterer from getting stoned. He was against divorce, but keep in mind that "divorce" back then was code for "throwing a woman in the trash because she's no longer useful to you". And, in a time in which a person's mother was barely mentioned in history books, his mom, Mary of Nazareth, became known as one of the key figures of Christianity.

Just like homosexuality as a sin and other conservative views, a lot of the misogyny in the Bible comes from Paul, who only started preaching years after Jesus' death, or from prophets who died before Christ was even born.

Exactly. TBBT isn't about an autistic guy, it's about how people hate living with an autistic guy.

It's Autism Speaks as a mediocre sitcom.
Because his (stereotypical and exaggerated) traits clearly show what the characters intended him to be. Besides, if I recall well he was based on one of Chuck Lorre's former roomate, who had Aspergers.

And they never say he isn't an aspie. They leave his disorder deliberately vague to avoid angering the politically correct crowd.
TBH, a selfie of Joseph and Mary with Baby Jesus could end countless theological debates and even prevent wars.
All of the time. My first boss was the worst example.

Not only did he often made fun of my naivete and played mean-hearted "pranks" on me, but he took advantage of my inability to sense people's true intentions to exploit me on a daily basis. All while pretending to be my "friend". It took me months to finally stand up for myself and quit.

Fucking dick. If he wasn't married to an awesome woman who legitimately cared about me and had a 2 year old daughter, I'd wish for his "company" to go bankrupt.
There's a difference between self-diagnosing with the intent of looking for a professional diagnosis later, and simply accepting that online test you did once at WebMD as the undeniable truth.
Because lots of mentally ill people are assumed by NTs to be "just pretending" or "exaggerating". To them, depressed people are just sad, people with ADHD are just lazy, and autistic people are just shy.

A bunch of idiots thinking they're autistic because they read the Wikipedia page on autism once only makes these misconceptions worse, especially when they refuse to let a specialist give the final verdict.
How do you know they are?
Not exactly an American thing. In Brazil we have "caramba/caraca" for "cacete/caralho", "filho da mãe" for "filho da puta", and so on.
I'm completely unable to approach people I'm interested in. I did dated three people, one of which I had a month long relationship with, but they all made the first move.
I wonder if there's a connection between this and how girls claim lesbians eat pussy better.

Guess it's easier to know what turns your partner on when you have the same genitals.

>Where people refuse to give ideas that don't deserve it increased visibility out of a misplaced sense of obligation to debate any person on any topic at any time.

Tumblr is filled with Nazi blogs, Hapa blogs, Hotep blogs, tweaker blogs, shoplifter blogs and even serial killer fandom blogs.

>Where people are aware of the physiological and psychological effects of trauma and harassment.

Again: You mean the place that lead a little girl to suicide because she drew a Steven Universe character too thin? 

>Where people understand the difference between 'political correctness' and common courtesy.

"Common courtesy"? The most common debating tactic they use is reposting a selfie from the other person and calling it ugly.

Unless it's THEIR opinions who are threatened of course. Also, isn't that the same argument people use against Net Neutrality?
I once read about an experiment done in an African country (they didn't disclose which one) involving kids from two different public schools. One of them punished kids with spankings, the other used methods such as detention, grounding, scolding etc.

The kids were placed in a room with a hidden cam. In the center of the room there was a table with a toy they were explicitly told not to touch.

Both groups had around the same number of kids who disobeyed the order and grabbed the toy. But, when asked if they had obeyed the order, the kids from the spanking school were able to lie more convincingly and with less shame.

TL;DR: Beating up your kids won't discipline them, it will just convince them to hide their indiscipline better.
Cool motive. Still murder.

People can choose to date the same gender, but that does not make them gay. Similarly, a gay guy could date a woman in order to hide their homosexuality (this is known in LGBT circles as "having a beard") and still not be straight, and a kissless virgin isn't necessarily asexual.

Your sexuality is innate and defined by what you're attracted to, not what gender you choose to have sex with.

Isn't violating freedom of speech what Stalin, Mao and Kim-Jong Un would do?
Nothing. I mean, what could possibly be wrong about supporting history's greatest mass murderer? /s
And there's also Maoists, Stalinists and lots of people who see Che, Fidel and Chavez as revolutionary heroes.
Then we should change that mentality and make it okay for black people to wear cornrows instead of forbidding white people from wearing it. Especially since restricting it to black people would otherize it even more, making the problem worse.
>How would you feel if some random claimed a accessory or statement from your culture that has be known and active for hundreds of years and claimed THEY discovered it

But that's not what happens. No one goes to a Japanese restaurant, eats sushi and goes "hmm, this food white people invented is delicious".
It amuses me that the people who bitch about cultural appropriation are also the same ones pushing for multiculturalism.

As if you could defend segregation and non-segregation at the same time.
And you don't see a problem with it?
Obama did caused racial tensions to stir up in my opinion, but not because of his actions. Having a black man as the president of a country with a history of racism and a culture of segregation as big as the US would never go down without conflict.

The good news is that it was still a major step towards equality in the long run. It's just that there's always a storm before a rainbow.

>Sim, porque só muçulmanos acreditam em Deus.

Essa é a questão. Não só feministas acreditam em igualdade de gêneros. Igualitarismo, MRAs, direitos dos transgêneros... Todos esses também são movimentos pela igualdade de gênero na teoria tanto quanto o feminismo é.
This guy must really love Charlie Chaplin.
Por essa lógica, se você acredita em Deus é muçulmano, se odeia violência contra animais é membro do PETA e se gosta do seu país é nacionalista.

Feminismo não é sinônimo de igualdade, é um movimento ideológico específico que não pode ser definido por uma só característica. Simplesmente acreditar em igualdade não te faz feminista. Primeiro porque o feminismo não é o único movimento pela igualdade de gênero. Segundo porque o feminismo também inclui aceitar diversas teorias, dogmas e ideias, como a existência do patriarcado, por exemplo.

Read the post. OP did a test that made him suspicious of having Aspergers, and wants to go to a doctor to confirm that suspicion.

That's not self-diagnosing, that's pre-diagnosing and it's okay.
Yes. There's a reason psychologists nowadays refer to autism as a spectrum. Some people have only a few traits of Autism or Aspergers while some have most of them. Unfortunately, media tends to portray us all as the same Sheldon-esque stereotype, which makes identifying AS harder.

Hello daddy, hello mom
My theory is that The Incredibles is based on the end of the Golden Age of Comic Books and the beginning of the Silver Age.

In the early 50's, a psychologist named Fredric Wertham published the book Seduction of the Innocent, with a thesis on how superhero comics caused juvenile delinquency. The resulting parental panic plus the lack of interested in supers thanks to the end of the war led to many titles being cancelled.

Similarly, the prologue to The Incredibles shows how moral guardians and angry citizens made the government force supers into retirement, and later we discover Syndrome has been "cancelling" the heroes as well.

The Silver Age started a few years after Wertham's book, bringing a new generation of heroes and reinventing the old ones, in the same way the movie depicts. It was also marked by a decidedly sci-fi vibe, and the launch of the Fantastic Four, the obvious inspiration for the family.
And all the architecture is based on marble pillars, but that's a coincidence.
Related to the second one, the Hitler clone. You know the type: charismatic, megalomaniac, wants to exterminate all the races he consider inferior. It's such an easy villain to make and to hate.

And yeah, there are plenty of bi people who are 40 or older. Like other elder LGBT people, they tend to stay more in the closet due to the prejudiced society they grew up in, and also because elder sexuality in general is still seem as "icky". Just because you don't personally know any doesn't mean they aren't there.

>"Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument." -Wikipedia

You didn't deny Hillary Clinton was dishonest, just pointed out Trump was also dishonest without actually refuting the first claim. Thus, whataboutism.

Black supremacists who believe in a bunch of wacky conspiracy theories. My favorite examples include:

* White people are demons created by a big headed scientist named Yakub in order to take over the world.

* Melanin gives black people superpowers by absorbing sunlight, kinda like Superman.

* Related to the above, white people kidnap black people to steal their melanin and sell it in the black market (pun intended).

* Black people used to have an epic futuristic civilization like Wakanda until white people defeated and enslaved them despite being inferior.

* AIDS is a plague white people created to get rid of black people. Same thing with ebola, swine flu, cancer and the most deadly of all diseases: homosexuality.

* Name a civilization or historical figure; chances are some Hotep has a whole theory on how they're actually black and white people covered it up.

People also said they "weren't voting for no darn negroes", and yet Obama was elected. Twice.

The difference between Hillary and Obama is that he had charisma, knew how to appeal to the youth and, most importantly, brought something new to the table besides being just a black president. Like him or not, he knew how to convince people to support him.

Hillary is simply unlikeable as a person, was involved in many corruption scandals and is the face of political establishment. Her only positive traits were her gender making her possible election a historical event, and the fact that she isn't Trump.
Oh, she's an "empowered" woman and has political experience? That makes her about as as qualified to be president as... Sarah fucking Palin.

People who claim Hillary lost the election because she's a woman are so delusional. It's the exact opposite. The only reason Hillary got that far is because she's a woman.

Why should we shot someone for being a pedophile? Don't get me wrong; to child molester, suffering forever in Hell isn't punishment enough. But why hunting down those who are attracted to children but never did anything illegal? That's basically punishing someone for crimethink.

>Also, by calling pedophilia an orientation we recognize that they are incurable and can finally stop giving them chances to be a part of society. They are a write off.

That's not what sexual orientations are for.
No, because it isn't related to gender.

Basically, a preference is how you like your partners to look like or how their personality is, while a fetish is related to what you prefer in bed. Paraphilias are similar to fetishes, but are caused by psychological disorders and/or morally questionable (like pedophilia or necrophilia). Sexuality is what gender you're attracted to in a general way.

I agree partially. Sexuality is simply what gender you're attracted to: men, women, both or neither. Anything more specific than that is a fetish, sexual preference, personality type or paraphilia.

This being said, asexuality is definitely a thing.


And I've seen girls who don't like ginger dudes, and guys who prefer tall chicks.

I never said it was a jab at white people. I just said it perpetuates these same stereotypes by making it look like successful black people are the exception to the rule, and that it diminishes the person's achievement by making it about race.
You can only "subvert" a trope too many times before it becomes a trope itself.
Sociology isn't an exact science. It's barely science at all, just a collection of highly subjective ideologies.

But explain to me. How is this definition better than "prejudice based on gender, no matter what gender"? How does it help create a more equal society? Or does it only serve for assholes to be assholes without being called out on it?
