There is no way he's that far from the waterfall and able to turn around without us noticing without editing.
Can the president ignore executive orders? I mean, he can just overturn them with another order if he wanted to, does it matter if he just ignores them instead?
Last time there was a similar deal(12 credits at once) they offered an Echo Dot to go with it ($50). 

I bought it, but was shortly after given 6 more credits for free, for a total of 18. I have no idea why this happened, but I wasn't the only one it happened too.

I'm guessing it'll be in the next batch of crown crates.
My favorite part about ESO that other MMOs don't do is the lack of a gear grind. MMOs like WoW and FFXIV have the gear grind as their bread and butter; it's basically the whole point to keeping playing, so you don't fall behind on gear.

But ESO doesn't care about that grind. They've actively worked against the grind with Transmute and being able to improve gear to the highest quality and being able to do it to jewelry soon. I've been using the same gear since forever and even if I wanted to change it, it wouldn't take that long to.
Cool strawman. You knock it down all by yourself?

Movie three has...this scene. It's hard not to see a huge drop in quality.

> realize most of the crown items could be add in grinding rewards to make the game more appealing and more successful

Having played FFXIV extensively, I disagree. To unlock the tiger mount in FFXIV you need to kill 2,000 S rank monsters and 3,000 A rank monsters. A ranks spawn every 4 hours and S ranks spawn every 34-ish hours. Both A ranks and S ranks are limited numbers each spawn. Even if you could fight them back to back nonstop, taking 5 minutes apiece to kill(in reality it would be more), it would take you 17 ***days*** to unlock the tiger.

I'd rather just have lootboxes than that garbage. At least lootboxes respect my time.
> the only positive memory i have playing skyrim was filling up a house with sweetrolls.

You realize there's other, cheaper, ways to get sweetroll furnishings in this game, right?

What the hell kind of midget are you?
who was camera????
It can be argued that those costumes are still behind a paywall because you can't get them without shelling out for a subscription or purchasing a DLC/chapter(The only exception are free ESO+ weeks, but those are pretty rare). The fact you can unlock them from within the game doesn't change the fact you had to pay money for that privilege.
> That was really the main thing that kept me going back to games like WoW and FF14, I was running older raids and things to collect mounts, pets and cool gear

ESO just has different priorities than FFXIV, and that's okay. Especially when the gear grind is something that ESO has actively worked to remove from itself.
> Can you buy all in-game motifs in the crown store?

Nope. Even factoring in rotating them into the store for a brief time, there are a lot that haven't been on the crown store at all.
Anton Yelchin is a phenomenal Odd. The movie itself is only okay, but seeing Yelchin as Odd is worth the price of admission alone.
Judging by the other arms packs, no. Unless they decided to give players a clannfear polymorph.
The arms packs don't include the monster set shoulder/helm for outfits. However, while the arms sets are available for purchase, you can (randomly) unlock the outfit shoulder/helm from undaunted chests. But ONLY when they're on sale.
The ending was written years before work was started on the game, so I don't know if that counts.
What?
With the example I gave, there was. No reason to have it be the same except laziness. It would not have affected the outcome at all to have the player character say what you choose and have the robot react to that answer.

Small big cats chase laser pointers. The bigger big cats, like tigers, could not care less about it. The theory goes that cats chase laser pointers because they're roughly the size of prey they'd catch in the wild. So a tiger wouldn't care about the laser dot since it's not big enough for their attention.

Enough of an issue with people that it was changed before the outfit was released.
For the first book, Alloy of Law, no. I had my mom and dad read it and they completely understood it despite not touching the first trilogy. They also both really liked it. It's as standalone as a book can be.

For the second and third books, Shadows of Self and Bands of Mourning, there is a lot of references to the first era trilogy, but the plots themselves only deal with current goings-on. Like, you won't be completely lost because you haven't read the first trilogy, you just won't understand the references. Actually, since you've read the first book, you'll understand a lot of them, and even the most important one that will most likely be plot relevant in book 4.

My father read the second and third books and followed along just fine, so I'd say the first trilogy isn't necessary for comprehension.

:Edit: The second era books take place something like a thousand years after the first era books, so all the characters are different. Since, you know, all the first era people are dead.
Have you really read no other books? You'd think school would have at least forced you to read a few authors.
I'm always baffled why people say the world building in NotW is top notch. The magic system is just equivalent exchange and a little True Name nonsense on the side. The world itself is Generic Fantasy Setting With Wizard University #3613. I'm just utterly baffled why anyone would think that's the best.
>But to be fair there is a sequence in the first 100 pages where a cohort of high mages battle an immortal possibly-demigod in a flying mountain, one of whom gets blown in half and then gets his soul shifted into a puppet. That was where I was hooked.

On the contrary, I was brought out of the action because of all that. I had 0 context going in so I cared not one whit about the characters or what happened to them. One character I didn't know getting blown apart was about as interesting as watching paint dry, to me.

Have you tried the second era Mistborn books? I absolutely love them more than the original trilogy. Sanderson's growth as a writer is very obvious when comparing era 1 and era 2 Mistborn series.
The sequel trilogy makes all the terrible parts of the first misborn trilogy worth it.
Yeah, no. There's magic.

I always thought the brain surgery thing was weird because she actually performs it. I mean, this is the book where she gets the Yeerk morph, of whose species' defining trait is to get into the brainspace of creatures. Couldn't her Yeerk morph handle Ax's issue without needing to be so invasive as to cut open his head? It's just weird to introduce the first Yeerk morph in the book where brain surgery has to happen, and then not use it for that purpose.

Also, I don't understand why Ax couldn't just morph out of his sickness since his issue was physical, but whatever.

Well, Ivalice was mentioned in the lore before the second raid we're getting, sooooooooooo yeah.
I'd say give it more than a day. Cops clearing people out would naturally scare off criminals.
Au Ra weren't developed at all before they were introduced/playable, because the only one we saw was Yugiri, and even then she wasn't a good representative of the race. Hell, we had to wait until the next expansion after they were playable to even see them as groups in their homelands instead of random unrepresentative individuals here and there.

If Viera/Bangaa were introduced in the Ivalice raids and then playable next expansion, they'd have almost the same amount of lore that Au Ra got before being introduced. Hell, they might even have more, depending on what the third 24 man raid is.
Unfortunately they've confirm Bangaa will never be playable. Or Viera, for that matter.

Fortunately they've confirmed that we'll get both in one as the new [Viangaa race](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/000029.html)!

Just look up any interview with people who left Valve.
I meant making games wise. Obviously Valve as a company is set for life. I meant that when they do get around to making games again, where will they be? A lot of the appeal of Valve games was the excellent writing.
Multiple people have cited this very reason for why they left Valve. They want to make games and Valve isn't making any.
How is this Trumpgret?
That I know who they are as a casual observer is a testament to how influential they are. Where will Valve be without them?
> (probably after never being able to get anything done)

Probably? Definitely.


Can't wait to see how Valve adds micro transactions to Campo Santo's single player games.
Valve's last single player game was 7 years ago with Portal 2. I'm not holding my breath.

^^^^^^^^^Yeah, ^^^^^^^^^yeah, ^^^^^^^^^they ^^^^^^^^^did ^^^^^^^^^that ^^^^^^^^^VR ^^^^^^^^^thing. ^^^^^^^^^How ^^^^^^^^^many ^^^^^^^^^people ^^^^^^^^^do ^^^^^^^^^you ^^^^^^^^^know ^^^^^^^^^who ^^^^^^^^^actually ^^^^^^^^^played ^^^^^^^^^it?
Uhhhhhhhhh why? They've only put out one game.

IDK about you guys but I'd still die in PVP without killing anyone even with that buff.
I've fantasiaed into different races about, pffff 50 times now, at least? I'm too scared to look at my mog station receipts.

I don't like the races in FFXIV. In WOW I was happy to be a cow person or a demon person(depending on faction), and in ESO I'm perfectly okay with being a tiger person for 4 years straight since it released.  FFXIV's races just aren't animal enough for me. I don't think adding cat ears and tail is enough to differentiate them from humans and the **every** non-"animal" race is just some varient of human. I'm just not into playing what I already am. So I Fantasia as my moods come and go. It really sucks, too.

If characters are meant to be projections of us in the game world, then I'm not happy with any of the projections that are available in FFXIV.
Is that why they call it The Bends?
My SSD is "literally hard-coded with noise" too, I don't know why a vinyl records would be considered any different.

Are you just putting random letters in brackets to piss people off? Because if so, it's working for me.
Orsinum for covenant, Morrowind for pact, Summerset for Dominion. Makes sense.
It's so common you'd think it was part of a quest or something.
>Even with the inaccessible areas ignored, it's still likely the biggest explorable area in the game

This is purely my speculation, but this seems obvious with how packed the icons are.  Compare [this](https://i.imgur.com/747rzt9.jpg) with a map like [this](https://i.imgur.com/Cu6z6xR.png). Summerset has a lot of inaccessible area, but it is **dense**. A lot of the icons are in danger of, or even are, overlapping one another in Summerset, something that's not an issue in Wrothgar. Even if they are skimping us on explorable space land wise, it doesn't at all look like they're skimping us on explorable space do-things wise; to my eye it looks like Summerset has equal to or greater things to do than Wrothgar.
I have played for 99 days on my main. Although a lot of that was just idling in Rawl....

I didn't dislike Vin, I just felt she was missing a certain spark that would make me be fully invested in her. Vin felt a little too...convenient, I guess, would be how to put it? She didn't really do anything unexpected and her character arc was pretty obvious.

Wax's actions are pretty boring because they're even more obvious than Vin's were: He will always do the right thing, no exceptions. But as a character he's more interesting than Vin because every single villain is connected to his past, which makes everything personal for him. Through him we see how the villain was in the past, and how he's dealing with them in the present. Miles was a lawman he worked with turned villain, book 2's villain was...you know... Book 3(and 4?) are family members. And then there's Wax's rejection of Harmony after the events of book 2. 

I'm just a lot more engaged with Wax's stories than I was with Vin's.
>Its not free but my point stands

I don't listen to other DnD podcasts and this makes me glad I don't. Is that really what people want TAZ to be?
I have literally no idea what point you're making since TG/Orsinium/CWC aren't free.

[Citation needed.]

You do realize that they do one expansion, 2 dungeon DLCs, and one CWC-sized DLC every year, right?
> I never understood why they don't just have mounts that are relevant to the region in a particular stable.

Because Elder Scrolls has only had horses until ESO. For all we know, non-horses aren't canon.
> the problem is that ZOS is building new game systems in such a way that it drives people to use the cash shop and does not provide in game methods to obtain fun items. 

Housing doesn't require cash shop. You can purchase crafting tables with in-game currency. You can buy the storage chests with in-game currency. You can use the outfitter without the cash shop. Only 2 motifs on live are crown store exclusive, all others are obtainable in game.

Saying that there's nothing left because all the "fun" items are in the cash shop is a huge disservice to the effort ZOS puts into fun things, some of which even can only be bought with in-game currency.
Wow, those are awesome! Can't wait to immediately glamour over them!
I've found that the hard part is not falling asleep while doing it.

>should I play it if I’m a big fan of Skyrim, Witcher, Star Wars the Old Republic MMORPG, and Fallout New Vegas?

Yes. You'll be right at home here.
> I'm specifically referring to mounts as a tool to keep people playing.

ESO isn't really interested in the typical MMO treadmill to keep people coming back. There's no mount rewards, there's no gear treadmill. 

Honestly, that lack of structured rewards is what keeps me coming back. I can just do whatever I want and the game is like "Okay, sure, let's do that." If I tried that with WoW or FFXIV I would fall so far behind it's not even funny. I have to keep logging on to WoW and FFXIV to keep up and do the latest content until I'm fully geared from it.

Meanwhile in ESO I've been using the exact same mount and gear for literal years now, with only a couple pieces of gear being swapped out(Got my Maelstrom Arena lightning staff, baybeeeeee).
> Except Wow costs 15$ per month so those "free" mounts that take weeks/months to get aren't free.

And because of the mandatory sub fee, they're locked behind a paywall every month just to access them, so that's cool.

(I know there's an in-game method of paying for your sub, but my point remains: You're going to have to pay somehow for access, be it through money or your time(for tokens).)
Those aren't radiant apex.

Probably the same as Morrowind's houses. Here's a list of prices. Just apply the sizes of the place and voila, that's a good approximation for the price in Summerset.

>(Small) Saint Delyn Apartment: 3,000 gold / n/a(n/a) crowns.

>(Medium) Harbor Home: 332,000 gold / 4,000(5,000) crowns

>(Large) Amaya lake Lodge: 1,300,000 gold / 7,000(8.800) crowns

>(Exclusive) Tel Galyn Tower: n/a gold / 8,000(10,000) crowns

The easiest way around this issue is to have something that's hard for her to want to do, but make it central to the story so she has to eventually face it. She can destroy life or give it at a whim, but not everything can be solved by killing or healing someone.

Like, think Dr. Manhattan. He is invicible and can do literally anything, yet he's a fascinating character because of his internal conflicts. It is hard for him to want to do the things he needs to do, and his life is still tangled up in itself even with his omnipotent powers.

There are a ton of lux vendor housing items I use.
Cosmetics do matter; if they didn't then the ESO team woul just fire their art department and we'd just be playing with squares representing everyone.

But the people who get up in arms about pay-for-cosmetics are ignoring the alternative. To those who are not happy with cosmetics being in the cash shop: What would you be happy with? The only alternatives are subscription-based or Pay to Win. That's it. There's nothing else. Would you honestly be happier with those systems?
>Certain things are obviously over priced. $15 for a single character outfit slot. $150 houses. ... it can also be argued that these prices are insane and don't reflect their true value when compared to similar digital goods elsewhere.

Yeah, they are insane. They're also extra on top of offerings already in the game. There's a ton of houses you can buy with in game gold. I bought my main house for 75k gold when housing was released and I'm still using it as my main house. Outfits are the same. They give you one free. I haven't found the need to buy another slot; I can just pay gold if I want to change it.
Yeah idk where they're getting that $300 number from. Seems like a number they pulled from their ass.
I think they meant Hear here.
He'd probably say something like "90% of humanity are losers."
Well, kids are pretty stupid. When I was a kid I thought I'd be "just getting by" if I made $100k a year. It's hard to put numbers into reality when you're a kid, especially where kids are concerned.
> I think the people cheering for him to get raped in prison need to take a second to look at what theyre saying.

I don't really see a problem with it. Apparently everyone else replying to you doesn't know how  bills works, so let me educate them.

Just because a bill passes the House doesn't mean it'll pass the Senate, and vice versa. And even if a given bill passes both, there's a process called reconciliation where the discrepancies between the House and Senate bill are addressed to make them one bill. Reconciliation is a methodical process where a committee goes line-by-line through the bills and the stupid bullshit is cut out because reconciled bills need to be more focused than broad to pass the House and Senate. Then that shared bill is voted on by the House and Senate and if it passes it goes to the president to sign.
You mean .345 minutes late 3 years ago?
I think this would work a lot better if the order was "What's compost?" -> "Threw  a coffee cup in the compost" -> "What's wrong with you?"
I like the guild store addon that does this. Although I'd like it a lot more if I didn't have to scroll through pages and pages and pages and pages and pages of blank pages to find what I want.
> there's no way to obtain them with in-game gold or progression. 

It's almost like they're a nonessential piece of the game that's not required or needed, like they're just something extra instead of core to the game.
They've only done that with mounts so far, so I'm not really worried about that happening to non-mount items.

Also a sweetroll? But if you're upset you can't buy a glowing sweetroll, I don't know what to tell you.
Eh, to each their own.
The vast majority of it can be. 
I don't really think that's a lot of money.
Not as much as you imagine. Since these are individual pages and not entire motifs, I bet they'll be something like 15 gems/each, since a whole motif is 200. That's only a handful of crates that'll guarantee 15 gems.
>  I cant support any game that makes you PAY for RNG

You act like crown gems don't exist. There has been 0 times I relied on RNG to get what I wanted in crown crates. Some times I did get them trough RNG, but I never planned to. Because that's stupid.
> Why can't we buy it straight up?

idk about you but I have enough crown gems to do this.
>  man, don't talk like that "because you don't get exactly what you want", because i think that everybody wants different things.

I got exactly what I want in a tiger mount. So whatever flashy new mount doesn't interest me.  In fact, the only mount that would be a day one, must buy, is a tiger mount that's more orange instead of yellow.
Add piercings so we can store jewelry we make/get from drops, thus saving valuable space!
Why? It's tacky as hell with the bright shade they used.
Yeah, because it only ever used one core. With Summerset it'll finally use more than one core, so maybe it'll be okay?
Not just that, but it's a random video game movie. The last Rampage game was 12 years ago. It's mind boggling to me how this movie came to be created.
In what method should I rage against everything good and holy for abandoning me?
Honestly, I'm glad. I have more gold than I know what to do with, so wasting it on things like houses doesn't bother me.
Considering that the psijic crates haven't even been on the PTR, it's just speculation. The pages could be crown store purchasable without crates.
>If you want an unlockable item that really shows your skill, go after that.

I think I just woke up my neighbor with how hard I laughed.
> Make all of the pieces from the crates purchasable with Crowns.

If you really get technical, they already are.
Wow, what a bitch. I'm glad I chose to not kill her because it seemed like Naryu *reallllllllly* wanted me not to. Otherwise I'd have to be super upset she went against *my* wishes.

Yeah, exactly.
> Considering how popular it is now it was shocking to see it only made 500K

Only because of a really weird theatrical release.
I'm not. That movie had a ton of props and special effects that needed to be made.

If you read the book and that made you cringe, then I don't know what to say. The entire book was satire in every way except the plot.

Yeah, I don't know what the poster is going on about. If the universe's vastness can only be realized by making some colors fade, then that's pretty pathetic.
> If throwing dragons into, let’s say, the Napoleonic Wars is fantasy, then what if the setting was contemporary instead of historical.

They did that in the Temeraire series. Technically it's fantasy, since you can't do that stuff in real life. 

Your second point would just be contemporary/urban fantasy. Like Bright.
Monster hunter may not have magic, but holy hell is it unrealistic. Normally fantasy without magic would be historical fiction(alternate history or otherwise), but Monster Hunter doesn't fit that since it's so unrealistic.
That is completely not the point I'm making.
I don't know if that's fair. People in the US who simply can't get non-elective surgery because no insurance/poor don't count because they never even try to, but their wait times are effective sideways 8.
Fuck debt, man. If something like cancer happens you are grade A, 100% ***FUCKED***. It's not a medical emergency so the ER will turn you away. You can't do anything about it because you're poor. The only thing you can do is hope that you don't get it.

And as far as we can tell, cancer strikes randomly no matter your lifestyle. So better hope you win the luck lottery.

I read it as Saturday Night Ded. Since, you know, his name is Ned.
Minfillia's main issue is that she's a plot device to move the story along, be that her being captured or accomplishing something through diplomacy. To the player it doesn't matter because the plot will move on regardless even without her, as the expansions have shown. Being solely a plot device makes her a poor character.
I'd prefer personality to ability. Alisae might be middling in aptitude, but she has great personality and is fun to hang out with.

I do, however, want to point out that it doesn't really matter that Minfillia is a great negotiator; the story will happen with or without her because then there wouldn't be a story. So if the only purpose of her character is to be a plot device, then she is a *poor character.*

And about things being on the mogstation shop...The alternative is to have these items in game, which...jesus h christ. Want a pegasus mount? Do 2k Mentor roulettes. Want a tiger mount? Go kill 2k S ranks and 3k A ranks. I did the math on the tiger and even if each kill only takes you 5 minutes, that's over 17 **days** of work to obtain it if you kill them nonstop. I'd prefer to just pay a cool $20 or something, thanks. I like having a life outside the game.
More? Do they already have some in game?
> most players don't seem tolerant of mistakes. I've been chewed out for mundane crap

In my experience this doesn't happen in statics, just PUGs. After all, why would you want friction between people you're going to see the next raid day?
I got the gear and will, but no one, but NO ONE raids during my available timeslots.
Starting with OP.

Minstrel's Ballad: Furious Weapon
That sounds completely reasonable.  Therefore it's precisely not how SE will handle this.
Very, very salty people.
I wonder if they care one way or the other. Probably not.

I don't know what kind of bonuses you guys get, but I have had 0 bonuses from having my student ID. My student email address, however, has given me tons of bonuses with places.
Hell, you can drop a class without a W if you have the teacher/chair on your side this late. I don't see why it wouldn't work the opposite way too.
This isn't nostalgia for me, it's my present car.
ur crazy
Ha ha!

Oh wait, you're serious, aren't you?

Allow me to laugh harder.

#AHAHAHAHAHAHA
What?
Yeah, they're meant to be expensive/exclusive. If you don't want it, don't buy it. If you do want it, still don't buy it.
$30 dollars is the least amount of money I've spent on virtual items.
I always picture Ned as a skinny bald guy who looks like a slimy, back alley drug dealer for some reason.
No, it's still pretty stupid.
I'm pretty sure Overwatch is a bajillion times more popular than TF2. So yeah, TF2 ded gaem.
That's...actually pretty sad. I don't know why you think that helps your point. If LoL was the same way it wouldn't be the biggest game in the world; growth is what games want and need.
I think I'll do just that.
Who gives a shit.
Wow, fuck that subreddit. Why isn't it banned? 
Hellwood? Is that what it says?
I don't think it counts as confusing if the starting shot establishes the trick.
>They are referring to the Crown Crates

Uhhhhhhhhhh crates don't have houses. If you want to spend $100 on houses, that's your problem. The game offers plenty of houses that are fine with gold.
>It’s telling because it shows how little the people we trust to handle our best interests don’t understand where our society is headed.

Is this sentence confusing for anyone else?
Say whaaaaaaaaaaaat?
There's multiple chests that can store 30 items, I just don't want to accidentally buy the wrong one and never get a chance for a free chest. Damn things cost 100 writs.
I don't see loot boxes in ESO as gambling.

But then, I buy them expecting to not get what I want and purchase them based on the minimum number of gems I'm guaranteed to get, so there's no gambling at all.
I'm confused. I bought my main house for 75k gold, and basically furnished it with things I can craft(learned through designs bought with gold) and bought from achievement vendors(gold only). Crowns provide a shortcut, but a ton of the stuff I have in my house were either dirt cheap in guild stores or simply couldn't be bought with crowns.
What level, and what chest?
I bought it to keep my Morrowind/clockwork city keepsakes there from achievement items. I have each corner themed after a house/dwemer. It's pretty neat.
I would be super duper surprised if they don't. 
I've seen the rain in ESO, its not a light drizzle. Even if it were, there is no off season where there is no rain. It's just raining constantly.
That's just straight up racist.
Climates are labeled by how much rain they get. If it's raining for three weeks straight there, then yeah, it's a rainforest.
Always sunset.
Maybe don't buy a house that's in a rainforest next time?
From what I've seen of T_D, brigading is more likely.
I'm surprised they still have so many subscribers. Game is dead.
I honestly don't see why karma/post history matters. No one cares. Nobody.
http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/High-Collared_Coin_Ball_Gown
Wow, that is some serious dedication to the joke.
You get people happy about weird things when the glass weapons, a staple since the first Morrowind and notably green colored, were black/red/whateverthehellelse until dyeing came out. Glass weapons aren't ruby red, they're green!
The green is Vine Green.
Probably because they aren't that impressive.
Bouyant weapons have an internal glow that makes them visible in low light but is less impressive in sunlight. Glass weapons don't have an internal glow but with this dye it looks like they do because it takes whatever light there is and multiplies it. So if there's none, glass weapons simply doesn't glow. But man, in direct light they shine.
I thought you might have added those dots in. Jesus christ they're actually there.
Maybe it's an increase because it's just so damned detailed!

...I can dream.
I'm pretty sure they're doing this because no one was using the sets anyway. They all look lackluster these days, and when you can have awesome looking transmogs from previous expansions, why bother?
Tier 10 was the fucking pinnacle of class set looks. I still use the frozen blue T10 for my shaman.
I'm going to just assume you're really dedicated to the joke.
It took me forever to realize that "jajaja" was pronounced "hahaha" and not "jaw-jaw-jaw."
> Jalan is such a dislikable charatcer

I don't have issue with him being morally bankrupt; if I did I wouldn't have read it because Jorg is far worse and I read his series first.

It's just that I disliked him; there's a difference. Jalan was boring in his book. So, so boring. The whole thing was boring as hell, actually.
> naked save for a loin cloth brandishing a long steel broad sword

That's one badass loin cloth.
I thought that sounded pretty great until I read the first book. Jalan was so uninterested in the plot(and uninteresting in general) that I wondered why Lawrence didn't just make Snorri the narrator, because the book clearly wanted to be about him.

I skipped the second book.
Wayne is Marco from Animorphs.
I can't tell if you're joking. I honestly can't tell. 
Have you tried JRPGs? The Tales games in particular seem to like having main protagonists who are dumb as bricks.
That would explain why the left belt has so many jagged edges.
Eater? Eating would imply digestion happens somewhere along in the process.
He deleted this post too. Nothing if not predictable.
I love The Adventure Zone to death, but it always annoys me when they say something like "You know, they're like X actor from the movie Y?" "Oh yeah, I know exactly who you mean." I don't! I fucking don't! Can you please use a metric everyone would fucking know?

I bring this up because it's topical to OP's post. There's a shared family language there that 1: I don't share and 2: Therefore I don't care about it and wish they would stop.
Do debuffs like Brink of Death matter?
Oh, that. Because it's misleading as fuck.
I'm not denying that u/imnotlegolas was an asshole there. It just doesn't make him any less right.
Or maybe he's just too busy pushing his first book on Reddit to care about the sequels to an unfinished story.
ya wtf! god!
I'm not OP but I can tell you that I
"Quietly" accomplished.
He beat King on the horror bestseller for like, a day. Considering King doesn't write solely horror, that's...impressive, I guess? It's like saying you're faster than Usain Bolt because you can run faster than him when he's sitting down having dinner.

One of the key points that stuck out to me in the [/r/AMADisasters thread about his last AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMADisasters/comments/63t9ie/selfproclaimed_author_of_an_incomplete_book/) is that he got to the top of that list with social media self promotion, not because of the content of his book.
When they ask for money. It's like, wtf man? This is some great exposure, you should do it for free.
It's been 5 years since book 1 came out. "Busy" and "writing" might be too strong of words to use.
> I'm curious - what, if any, kind of marketing did you do for this book?

According to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMADisasters/comments/63t9ie/selfproclaimed_author_of_an_incomplete_book/) he uses imgur and reddit to promote himself(just like this very thread we're in). 

He published that book in 2013. 5 years later and there isn't a book 2 of the trilogy yet, and apparently the book just sort of ends in the middle of everything without resolution. I'm assuming he does posts like these whenever his sales numbers get low. He's up to something like 4 AMAs about the same book.

Thank you for putting [f] in the title. You would not believe how often I'm left utterly confused by what sex someone is while browsing this subreddit when they don't indicate it with [m] or [f] in the title. I think this subreddit, r/femalpov, which is dedicated solely to women and literally does not allow male posts at all, deserves better than to leave the readers hopelessly confused and I thank you for doing your part.
That sounds a lot like crafting to me. In fact, that's exactly how crafting works in ESO, down to wood/stone/metal being the base materials you get by whacking things with your pickaxe.
Bagus sekali.
Army of Darkness made it work pretty convincingly. I'd suggest you check it out if you haven't seen it yet.
Nah, it's still pretty fucking boring.
I wasnt aware there was a difference. I heard you had to gather materials to make those planks. Do they make them without materials?
[This one](https://v.redd.it/hthyscoj6yq01) even says Victory Royale at the end. Does it say that for zombie mode?

I don't know, that just really looks like BR mode to me.
From the clips I've seen, it doesn't look like they're fighting zombies, but each other.
What other mode is there?
There is crafting, for some reason. Apparently people like that?

Doesn't seem inconsistent to me. It includes Myst: Masterpiece Edition and RealMyst: Masterpiece Edition. Why would they include the inferior products?
"Barely" is even a stretch. Whatever connections the two games have is paper thin. Like, watery, mushy paper that doesn't hold together well.
Kingdom Hearts, for real? I'm sorry, but something can't have the best plot if it's completely incomprehensible.
> Gemini Rue: it's not very well know point and click adventure game with a setting similar to Blade Runner with a pretty intricate story.

I'm going to second this. Someone randomly recommended it in a Reddit thread years ago and I gave it a try. It's so good. So good.
No.
How I would do this well:

>She spoke with a thick southern accent when she talked. "Yeah, we get about forty or so a year around this time," she said.
>"Each resident of Connor's Cove is such a unique and complex individual, with his or her own rich family ancestry going back centuries," said Milligan, who relied on a host of sad literary crutches to differentiate his bland characters from one another, including limps, horrendous signature phrases, and in one agonizing instance, an eye patch.

Holy shit, my sides.
Yankee in King Arthur's Court by none other than ~~Samuel Clemens~~ Mark Twain?

I don't really have to imagine. All I have to do is check out any fantasy movie.
Personally I'm hoping that there's an option for a myst/riven/etc. mouse pointer pack. I use the Riven mouse pointer, but it's sooooo tiny on a 1080 screen.

There were only 25 of them. I guess there's only so many original concept images they could give out.

LOL! It'll be unfortunate if it doesn't reach that goal by the end of **today**, nevermind the 24th.
I'm so sick of Reddit upvoting anything meantioning death or cancer. You can't go a single day on the front of r/all without seeing multiple "Here's the last pic my father took before he died. It was of me," "My second cousin thrice removed's son's girlfriend just got over cancer today!" Why do we care? We don't. These people weren't in our lives before the post, and it really, really just seems like gaming the system for pity upvotes, which is absolutely pathetic. Doubly so in cases where the death/cancer is unverifiable.
Didn't they have The Great Depression right before WW2? I'm skeptical of this claim. Certainly it was the case a decade later, but right after WW2? Now way.
People married earlier back then because there was really nothing else a woman could do in society. The declining marriage rate directly correlates with women entering the workforce. Because it turns out that if you're self sufficient you have more options than marrying.

>it also shows he cared enough about his work that he voluntarily engages fans on his own time. 

This happens all the time on reddit.
I wouldn't say less. I've just heard that it's not the type of series I'd like, and the author being nice online wouldn't affect my enjoyment, or lack thereof, of their work.
To balance things out: they haven't for me.
I couldn't enjoy it because, like a lot of Gaiman's works, the narrator was just a witness to the plot. So I didn't have any connection at all and could really not care less about the narrator.

I feel the same about silent protagonists in games. Just ruins the whole experience for me.
I too stopped after trudging through the first book. I hear everything only gets worse in the second book, so I noped right out.

The only thing I don't understand is how people say the prose is beautiful. Certainly there are some beautiful parts, but the majority of the prose is ...not. It's basic, utilitarian.
The Devourers. "Okay it's about a guy who meets a werewol--half werewolf-- and then the werewolf tells him that he ate his mom, dad, and then maybe eats the narrator". It's way, way better than it sounds and I wish I could properly convey how much I fucking love the book.

It's not as useful as you'd think. I used it before and it has some limitations like if you're in combat and dismount you won't have your original skill because it can't change in combat. Some people are willing to deal with stuff like that, but I'm not.

Upvotes are cool and all, but I don't really post here for them. I've been on forums of some sort since the early 2000's and they didn't have upvotes there. For me, all Reddit did was replace the forums I used to frequent. I'm more disappointed when no one replies more than low/negative upvotes. And I should know, a lot of my comments go into the negative because I post opposite the hivemind because I want a discussion to happen, or am rude when I need to be.

Semi-related, my highest upvoted thing was me talking about someone's multibreast fetish. That was a pretty weird thing to have as my highest upvotes.

I don't know how many times I have to say this, but I'll say it again: if that guy didn't want to get shot, he shouldn't have been holding an item literally everyone has on them at all times, in his own backyard where he should have felt the safest.

It's like that guy that got shot in that hotel hallway a while back. He wouldn't have been shot if he just did what the officer was requesting he do and keep his legs crossed, his arms in the air, all while simultaneously crawling towards the officer.
I was not surprised to see the jaywalker was a black guy. I guess white people get off the hook for it?

Feel free to tell this tiger lover [which one is male and which is female in this picture](https://previews.123rf.com/images/123light/123light1408/123light140800055/31056950-portrait-of-two-bengal-male-and-female-tigers-resting-in-the-shade-of-a-bush-in-the-dry-savanna.jpg), since you seem to be an expert in distinguishing tiger genders. I personally couldn't tell you which is which.

Also, only blue lipstick = typical drag makeup?
I'm just going to assume you wrote the Cracked article and investigate the issue no further.
I, too, have read the article released by Cracked today.
Actually if you hold your breath long enough you'll just pass out and start breathing again.
Sorry, but tigers are the best.

Oh, I'm not offended at all! I'm just sad for you because you see a "tranny" when looking at a female character.
Fuck you.
You could have just said that in the first place.
Well they do wear some kind of helmet armor, so you're not really helping your case, here.
TY!
I think that says more about you than me.

Just Google "Ready Player One" with "masturbation monologue."
You basically need to do everything in Wrothgar to get the costume. Check out the requirements for Hero of Wrothgar.
IE was first released in 1995.
A single headshot would do him in. Do you see how that's an issue?
No, they added the tiger pet, finally.

Wait..what? Why? The head is the most vulnerable part of a body.
She straight up says she is in the book, and the actress playing her said she played Aech like a lesbian. It's almost like when you normalize something you don't notice it.
And?
Yep.
Having a lesbian black woman = not progressive. You're far more progressive than the shit you're railing against.
I wasn't aware I was rich. Hot damn, sign me up then!
I didn't even know what Teac was until you mentioned them, but I'm willing to part with a private company for that.

I just assumed it would come from being the biggest economy on the planet.

Also raising taxes on the rich. But that'll never happen, so first assumption it is.
Why did you pick 1984? Wouldn't a better time be something like 2000 when IE was at it's height?

I, for one, would like to see half a movie's worth of Wade's 6-month masturbation binge.
When King Kong smashed her motorycle? That's a weird part to get excited about, but you do you.
None. The references are there and if you get them, cool and if you don't, who cares? The Shining is the only one I can recall that you have to know the source material to understand why that scene is funny, though not having seen The Shining myself, I found that scene to be funny on it's own. So it's more like it's even more funny if you've seen The Shining.
> So when was it decided they were calling themselves The High Fives.

Terrible exposition in the movie, but in the book all the players were calling them that because their names were the top five on the scoreboard.
I, for one, would have loved to hear Wade's monolgue about why masturbation is so awesome. And have it take 10 fucking minutes, just like in the book.
> How come when he’s a hologram in Sorrento’s office he can put his arm through his hand? If he does that in real life his hand would be stopped by his arm.

That part bugged me too...
Firstly, why the fuck would you climb in to it's mouth. Secondly, see my first question.
Both of Cline's only works are his worst, so that establishes a baseline.
Then maybe they shouldn't have fucking included Tracer.
>The romance was pretty.....weird. Like Artemis had all the exact right lines about “you literally don’t even know anything about me in the real world,” but then none of it meant anything

The book ends this scene with them not talking for about half a year and Wade going into a pretty deep, masturbation-related depression.

I wish I was making that up.
I'm guessing it was so they could release it before Easter. Because, you know, Easter Egg...
Personally I'd rate a 5/7 "Okay".
I heard that a sexual abuse scandel got in the way.
Yes and yes.
I'm 100% certain that's what this is. The thing about ocean deaths, though, is that the bodies usually show up on land.
Yeah, the conflict is amazingly low stakes. And if it is high stakes, he almost immediately undercuts it. The password thing is a great example what I mean.
...so it's okay because he's using words?
We're doing comparatives here. In the movie it was a genuine "We're fucked" moment and from that she turns it into a huge success. IOI would absolutely capture their  biggest rivals for the prize  and put them to work in the slave mines, and eat shit because of the hubris of it. In the book, he gets himself captured out of nowhere, assures us it's okay because it's his plan, and it turns out that everything is okay because of shit that happened offscreen we were never told about until the plot needed it. His hubris makes him in control the whole time; that's boring as hell.
If you think my issue is that he's able to buy the password in the first place then you completely missed my point.
Could you explain what the difference is? The book has plenty of expanded references like describing Joust, the Ultraman time limit, or how Voltron forms. Several key plot points rely entirely on lifting the works of others verbatim, like how Wade has to get through War Games and has some direct quotes from the movie.
My issue with the book is that it was just a list of "This happened but I fixed it. But then this other thing happened and I fixed that too." And on and on and on until the book is over. Boring as hell.
90% of everything is shit.

Statistically, there's a 9/10 chance my reply is shitty.
I hate The Martian too, but propaganda????? What?????
If you thought the movie was childish and on the nose, hooooo boy do you not want to read the book.
For more info, check out Armada by the same author.
The book didn't have much references to the dystopian society they lived in anyway. There's lip service to roving bands of outlaws and trucks that deliver "goods and services," but the whole dystopian landscape has no effect on the plot and every reference to the lawless wilds could fit into a five sentence paragraph.
I am officially crediting all the good changes to the movie to the co-writer, then.
>I think buying a backdoor password on the black market from a disgruntled programmer isn't purely magical in my opinion

It absolutely is a magical plot device from nowhere if it's not even hinted at in the narrative before it's used. That being the case, it makes Wade look like he's proud of fooling the reader about what's really happening. After all, if there was foreshadowing, we could have probably figured out what he was trying to do, which would have made him seem less clever.
What was the sword on Parzival's back a reference to?
I disagree. Wade getting a magical password without any foreshadow and explaining his plan as it's happening, with no mention of it before the chapter he's captured, is just sloppy writing.
>The references in the book. Their frequency and with how much detail the author went into explaining each and every one 

I was more annoyed by the pages-long reference lists that didn't explain what the references were and it didn't matter anyway because they were never brought up again.
I honestly preferred it to the book's story. The part with the person infiltrating IOI was done a lot better in the movie, and was not a complete asspull like in the book.
Do the credits say "&" or "and"? "&" means they collaborated on the script together, "and" means they both worked on the script, but not at the same time/together.
I'm glad he doesn't come off as a complete douche like he did in the book.
The bootup sequence. Where it literally shows it scanning the face.
Yeah they do. What do you think the bootup sequence is?
If you want a new worst ever book, try Cline's second book Armada. I thought RPO was okay and entertaining. Armada was just shit the whole way through. Just complete, utter shit.
Did we see the same movie?
The book's pot is almost completely different. That said, you don't need to read it if you've seen the movie; it's way worse.
He's even worse in the book.
Having read the book, I'm glad movie viewers were spared Wade's philosophical rants.
The book was .....okay, but plenty entertaining. The movie was pretty great and plenty entertaining.
>Name one thing the movie does better than the novel besides the awe of special effects?

Not having a chapter dedicated to masturbation.
Curator is the fucking MVP of the movie, as far as I'm concerned.
And then he doesn't do anything with it! It's like, why bother?
I just took that to mean IOI's rig wasn't set up to hide it. You don't see her avatar after the big battle, so who knows.
Have you read his second book Armada? I'm 100% convinced everything good about the movie that wasn't in the book was due to his co-writer.
Yeah that was just a weird line...
>There were moments that hinted at a more substantial story that seemed to fall through: "you only see what I want you to see, that's what you're in love with" was great, and there could have been a great story there - but of course she's gorgeous with a bit of a birthmark, not the obese, dirty/sweaty male sociophobe I was hoping for. 

The book handled it the same way. All that "you don't know the real me" talk with the payoff being her skin is discolored around an eye. Whoopdee do.
Wade didn't have any emotions about his aunt dying in the book, either.
>Maybe I’m just a jaded asshole, but I thought this movie was pretty bad. The whole thing felt like a barrage of rather obnoxious “remember this??????” moments.

I don't know, I didn't think the references were too egregious. Then again, I read the novel and was rolling my eyes so, so many times at all the pointless references, so maybe my tolerance is higher than yours.
Oddly, that was the only time I was conscious of product placement in the movie. I think it's because I'm 99% certain they had to pay someone else for everything they used.
>- It felt a little odd when Samantha just dumped all that ~~exposition~~ backstory on her dad so abruptly on Will only to never have that topic be revisited again in the film.

I don't remember if her father was ever mentioned in the book, but that scene in particular had very different consequences in the book. Wade and Art3mis don't talk for like, half a year after that and Wade goes into a deep depression.
He was shooting at them. The glance she gave him was one where it was right before she shot back.
There are cringe-inducing references, but the entire contest is riddles about, and solved by looking at, Haliday's past, separate from what he loved from the 80's. Wade is no longer a kid who has memorized every episode of Different Strokes or whatever, because there's no need to in this version. The scene you're talking about where they quiz each other is reduced to a few lines and used to connect the male/female leads.

In fact, it would be easier to list the similarities of the book and movie than the differences.
Meditations by Marcus Aurelius became just background noise for me after I realized I didn't give a shit about any of the stuff he was talking about. I finished it only out of obligation since I spent money on it.

I don't think they need to put any effort into why saying racism is bad; it should be self evident. My issue is that the devs used it as shorthand for why it's okay to kill the people of Columbia: Because they're unsympathetic, racist bastards. It completely annihilates any complexity or ambiguousness the story might have in regards to racism or just straight up murdering a city full of people.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H89MI4KlcQ&feature=youtu.be&t=58s
I guess you're taking your coffee black these days?
No, see, but you see, RACISM is bad, see, and that's why patriotism is bad, see?
Good to know that the plot had even more contempt for the setting than I thought.
I don't know, I guess I just expect better from grand, sweeping themes that deserve better.
My point is that they aren't smart games. At least not about what they porport to be about. BioShock is plenty clever with player agency. It's just....ehhhhhhhhh? with objectivism.
>TBH I haven't hanged anyone in a few years

Whoa, hey, what? Are we just going to burying the lead like that? What's this about?
Hey, that actually happened to me with [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/80mvoe/oklahoma_deputies_arrest_man_and_take_his_money/dux7w81/?context=3). They're every bit of Nazis as r/T_D is when it comes to dissenting opinions.
I would be surprised if the plan wasn't to ruin that statue. Fuck that guy.
I'm personally going to riot if they don't.
It's not about taking sides, it's about exploring the theme in depth. I have no issues with Bioshock saying that objectivism leads to societal collapse. I just wish they would have explored it beyond that. What makes it bad, is there any good from the system, who wants to keep it and who wants to abolish it, is societal collapse inherent in the system or a problem with Rapture in paticular, does that make Ryan the villain and Atlas the hero despite Atlas being the final boss, etc. None of these things were addressed in Bioshock. Or, if they were, the answer was something comical like "Societal collapse is inevitable under objectivism because it allows people to magically get superpowers that make them go insane." Like, do you see why that's not a discussion about objectivism?
Here, let me put it this way: if you take out every reference to objectivism, would the game be the same? I'd argue it absolutely would be the same because the story it wants to tell can still be told without it, which means that objectivism isn't important to the game.

Contrast that with Spec Ops: The Line, where themes of heroism are central to the plot, and the plot moves forward specifically because the main characters can't leave well enough alone and want to be heroes. From that baseline the theme is explored and expanded upon with questions about what it means to be a hero, are you still a good guy if you do bad things for a good reason, does killing people to be heroic have an affect on your sanity,  etc. And these questions are *in the plot itself*; you cannot separate the plot from it's theme. It is unequivocally a game about heroism.

Compare that with BioShock's objectivism, which never goes past a surface scratch because it's plot is concerned with you following Atlas' orders. You could remove all the audiologs without the plot changing. That's the difference between lip service and having a meaningful discussion about a theme.
>Note:This is about micro-transactions that ... bypass gameplay like timers.

Why are you playing those sorts of games in the first place?
Yeah. Maybe it just felt like a quarter because the rest was a slog.

> Novels sell far better than shorter fiction.

It always seemed to me like a collection of short stories would sell better.

But then Chuck Tingle sells a ton of 2k-3k word stuff, so what the hell do I know?
That doesn't really tell me anything about objectivism because, again, that happens in other spheres of politics/philosophy too.
> Vaas Montenegro, the main antagonist

You mean the guy who dies like, a quarter into the story?
HR I'm not sure; it just explores the surface level of things so it's a general issue. It needs to be focused on a few themes instead of all of them.

Bioshock taking place before the fall. You know, when objectivism actually applied to Rapture instead of anarchy.

Bioshock Infinite not being about warping through space and time. Also a message more meaningful than "RACISM BAD!"

Mirror's Edge everything. Just literally everything.
If you can miss certain themes of a given work by virtue of never seeing the content containing them, then maybe that work isn't about those themes.

To address your point, here's the penultimate philosophy behind Ryan from one of his audiologs:

>I believe in no God, no invisible man in the sky. But there is something more powerful than each of us, a combination of our efforts, a Great Chain of industry that unites us. But it is only when we struggle in our own interest that the chain pulls society in the right direction. The chain is too powerful and too mysterious for any government to guide. Any man who tells you different either has his hand in your pocket, or a pistol to your neck.

That's nice lip service to objectivism, but does it affect anything in the game? Both before and after this audiolog you're running and gunning and shooting people in the head and hacking computers and doing everything but the Great Chain Ryan is talking about. Like, am I getting it through that mentioning something is not the same as addressing it?
You mean the crisis Atlas started by waging a war against Ryan for control of the city because he was a power hungry douche? You may recognize this trope from basically every power hungry villain ever, no matter what political philosophy they're under.
>Why is someone assuming that you're smart enough to derive your own meaning from their art them being weak?

There's a lot of points in your response I could address, but this is really the crux of the issue, so I'll address it: These games have plots that completely ignore the issues they claim to be about.

Since you mentioned Bioshock, I'll discuss that. Bioshock is not about objectivism. It's about being deceived by Atlas and then getting revenge, with the meat being you're trying to save Atlas' daughter or whatever and then you kill Ryan and then you kill Atlas. That's the whole plot. You have to look at the plot to understand what a story is about, and themes of objectivism are nowhere in the plot structure. Therefore, the story(and by proxy the game) isn't about objectivism. 

Devs don't have to take a side, I'm fine with that. But it would be nice if they would do more than think they're so damned clever for inserting references to these grand idea without addressing them in any meaningful way.
> Errant Signal has a video of Deus Ex Mankind Divided that talks about how that game fails to follow through on many topics it brings up for example.

This just seems to be an issue with games in general where they mistake lip service to a subject for meaningful discussion/confrontation of those subjects.

Off the top of my head:

* DE: Human Revolution having nothing meaningful to say about augmentation and who controls society. 
* Bioshock having nothing to say about objectivism. 
* Bioshock Infinite having nothing to say about American exceptionalism or christian religious zealotry.
* Mirror's Edge completely ignoring the oppressive government *and* the rebellion against it.

I could pick my brain and list more but you guys get the idea. Bringing up a subject matter isn't the same as discussing it, and in a lot of these games the most interesting part of the discussion is just a backdrop to the main story that is far less interesting(Looking at Mirror's Edge real hard here).
>Don't tell me your story is going to have a bunch of crap, let it speak for itself.

Marketing. Why would anyone be interested in anything if they didn't know what was in it beforehand?
This sounds exactly like what happened with Bioshock infinite. It claimed to be about American exceptionalism and religious zealotry, specifically related to christianity, but at the end of the day the only way it addressed any of these points was "HURR DURR ON THE NOSE RACISM IS AWFUL."
Not only that, but...

You don't know what you're talking about.
wtf are you talking about?
>i'm not happy with the fact that i have to pay extra for content in a game

Are cosmetics really content? There's a pretty big difference between a new dungeon and, say, having a new mount to ride around. You're not really getting that much of a different experience than someone who does have this emote.
I like how Odin and Shiva's emotes took statues that cost $140+, but with Bahamut it's like "Nah, fuck it, toss it on the mog store."
I'm still buying this, though.

> For years now more adult diapers are being sold than children's diapers in Japan.

I hear this statistic a lot, but is it unusual? Lets look at the timeframe of those who would need diapers. Baby diapers are only needed for 3 years at most, while adult diaper needs can stretch on for decades. Given the range that someone needs adult diaper, is it really odd that there's more old people needing diapers than babies who quickly grow out of them?

>I can't think of a scifi demon

Shoot the cyberdemon until it dies.
By things I mean the parts. Without the second part there is even less of a reason to keep the first part because it doesn't relate to anything and the message is just "The universe did it's thing over a long period of time." Which can really apply to the prologue of literally every story every written: "The universe did it's thing over a long period of time and then Harry Potter was born." 

The second part is more applicable but the scene could be summed up as  "The man offered the woman, who was pregnant with twins, an apple, which she bit into." It's action, but doesn't really tell anything interesting. It's more like a description of a portrait or painting than the beginning of a story.

My advice would be to skip all this backstory and get to writing the actual characters you want the story to be about. If this intro stuff is important it can be alluded to/explained later.
I'm gonna lean hard to the latter. You're describing two different things that don't related and I don't really see how they connect.

Only if it's something like 4 hours. Anything above that and I'm fine with spending a credit on it.
This seems to be the fate of a lot of soft reboots done decade/s later. The original mojo is gone.
As far as I can tell, yes. Someone mentioned they had 18, after previously having 12 from the promo, in the thread announcing it and I had the same thing happen with me. That's as far as I can confirm or deny it, so do it at your own risk.
I'd probably keep it too, honestly. It's a unique item.
That's 400 gems right there. Not a bad deal.
I thought it was pretty dope when god condones gleefully murdering infants.
The best way to make a Christian into an Atheist is to have them read the bible cover to cover.
Same.
For some reason it turns into 18 credits shortly after. I don't know why it does that but I'm not complaining.
Fuck tips. Get rid of them.
God, I still can't believe those are a real thing.
It's unfair either way.
Oh I guess that makes it okay then.
That is just as bad as race discrimination, and only proves my point.
So it was pointless. Got it.
Anecdotes are cool and true and immediately discredit observable data from studies that day otherwise! Surely what they did at your restaurant is what they do everywhere :D
There's actually data backing up my claim; your opinion isn't true or needed.
Don't tip. That's the way.
So don't tip. I understand now.
>So serve then? 

Actually that's what's happening. Restaurants are having difficulty finding cooks/chefs because everyone knows the money is up front. In fact, people who graduate from Culinary school, who's dreams are only to be a chef, throw in the towel and serve instead, because the money is miles better.

>At least as a cook you don't have to worry about a server screwing you out of a $40 tip because of their mistake.

It works both ways, too. Put your heart and soul into a dish and the fucking *server* gets the credit and the increased tip. And they don't pay you a dime of that tip. In fact, they couldn't even if they wanted to; it's illegal. Because racism.
Yeah, no one cared about crates in Overwatch because they only had cosmetics. They bitched up and down the walls about BF2 because someone who bought crates could easily kill someone who didn't.
Why did crates drive you away? They only contain cosmetics. Your gaming experience isn't better or worse than someone who buys crates.
That's cool but I was only talking about California. Obviously I wouldn't tip in any state, but that's neither here nor there.
Basically no reason to. I hear you.
So basically no reason to. Got it.
Those people aren't paid normal wages? That sounds illegal.
So basically no reason to. Just as I thought.
Why are those numbers so low?
Where I live, California, the servers are guaranteed minimum wage. I don't tip.

:Edit: Those downvoting want to explain why I should tip?
The current system is also racist as hell. You think a black man makes as much in tips as a blonde woman? Helllllllll no.
This is what pisses me off. I work in the kitchen of a restaurant. The servers make 3-4 times the money I do, and all they do is take orders and deliver the food. Personally I think that's bullshit, they don't do 3-4 times the work I do. In fact, it's most likely less than me.
The second they go pay 2 win is the second they lose their entire playerbase.
I think expecting to get what you want through RNG and then being disappointed when you don't is folly of the highest degree.
I was more talking about DLC like DB or Orsinium and expansions like Morrowind, but yeah, basically. You can't do any of those without ponying up money so it's a paywall.
I just assume that I'm going to have to buy what I want with gems. Then I calculate the most amount of crates I'll have to get without dupes, and then see if that's an acceptable price. So...."$40 or lower for X....I could do that."

It's really no different than buying something directly from the crown store, except there's other goodies included.
I mean, I don't go in buying crates thinking I'll RNGsus my way to what I want. They put the gem system in for a reason.
You should definitely have enough gems by 55 crates to get the apex mount you want. I'm calling bullshit if you say otherwise; the math simply doesn't work out to you not getting it.
No, I just know bullshit when I see it. Honestly, who would think spending 17 days without breaks to get a mount is acceptable?
LOL!!!!!

Holy shit, dude. Are you serious? You're serious. Allow me to laugh harder.

#LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
>It's not about the money. It's about transparency. This is about being forthcoming with the extremely low drop rates. 

I think them having the gem system is enough of an admission that drop rates are pretty low. It acts as a ceiling you can hit where if you buy enough, you *will* get the item you want.

Unless it's a radiant apex item. In that case my advice would be to simply ignore them because you're not getting them. You just aren't. Deal with it.
If you say so. He still hasn't addressed my last question.
Wait is it 15 or 40 crates that's the max you can buy?
>  Also, a sub isn't a paywall lmao.

If you really believe that then I guess we're done because there's simply no reasoning with you.
> You're trying to relate your gem gain to this, but you're doing so by following a sub-optimal process.

You're the one that said you can get 400 gems from only 40 crates, and that's simply untrue if you only buy 40 crates. If you count 40 crates after 50 crates or something then yes, you can get 400 gems from 40 crates. But you'll never get that much off the first 40 crates.
ummmm what part dont u understand?????

Let me quote you from earlier:

>[My friends] won't touch any games that have stuff locked behind a paywall

A subscription is a paywall. vis-a-vis, they won't touch ESO because they're used to pirating games for free.
idk it still sounds like your friends want content for free, which is lol maybe they should just buy the dlc and expansions?
> It is very easy to buy one stack one day, piss away half your gems on little stuff you wanted, use a couple of those riding lessons, buy another stack a week later, then wonder why you don't have enough gems to get that legendary thing you wanted. 

...what? If all I'm buying crates for is the mementos, then I don't see the problem. Also, who tf would use riding lessons instead of gemming them?
> Yeah, that's "Pay2Skip", another predatory monetization scheme.

I'm completely okay with Pay2Skip for something where, if you kill the monsters one after another repeatedly without stopping, it still takes you 17 days.
I don't give a shit about a status symbol, I just want a fucking tiger mount. At least ESO has the decency to give it to me without wasting my time.  If you prefer to spend at least 17 days, back to back and with no breaks, to "earn" your mounts, then fine, go ahead. Personally I don't like such bullshit grinding and gladly pay money for mounts.
>Opening 45 crates and ending up with fewer than 400 gems would just about require getting no dupes

Normally I buy 40 crates every crate season to unlock the mementos and sometimes I have to buy more crates to get them all, and those total, what, 165-ish gems? There is no way 40 crates would ever get you 400 gems in a new crate season.
Let me tell you about the alternative to crates, which I ***HATE*** with a passion. Final Fantasy XIV recently released a tiger mount. The only mount I ever want in multiplayer games, and the mount that renders all others pointless for me. Well, in ESO I bought some crowns and boom, I got the tiger mount, no problem. 

With FFXIV however, a game without loot crates, I need to kill 2,000 S rank monsters and 3,000 A rank monsters to get a tiger mount. S ranks are limited to 34 spawns over the course of 3 days and if you're not there for the kill, better luck next time. If you somehow manage to get one kill on every S rank monster every week it would take you an entire year. A ranks are a lot easier to kill because each one spawns every few hours, but still, you need a fuckton. Each S/A rank takes at least 5 minutes to kill, between travel/waiting for stragglers/killing them. And on top of that you need to be logged in and paying attention to the game for the callouts someone has found one. The sheer amount of time it involves to get the damned tiger mount in FFXIV makes me so goddamn frustrated. I would much rather pay for a ton of crates than to have to grind that bullshit.

So yeah, I consider buying crates to be a great deal, because I know the alternative and I hate it even more.
Well you know, DLC and expansion content might be locked behind a paywall, but I personally don't mind because by buying them I'm supporting their game. Different strokes for different folks and all that. Your friends should probably stick with games they can pirate, unlike ESO.
>Because it might actually be more than 4,500 crowns.

Oh no! I didn't realize this! Whatever will I

Of fucking course I realize that. Ask me how many shits I give about buying crates. I can spare the money.
> You...do realize of course that if ZOS wanted to, they could put every single one of those items into their in-game store directly? With a set price, without a need for gambling or tertiary currency

Yeah, and then they charge you 4,500 crowns like [they did with the Great Elk mount](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Great_Elk). I'd rather take a mount that includes other random goodies and stuff I can convert into currency to buy even more goodies over spending 4,500 fucking crowns on one mount alone. No thank you.
#MORE RAZ IS ALL I CARE ABOUT GIMME MORE RAZ TY
Your friends sound like they just want a lot of stuff for free without having to pay for it.
