Another about someone who worked for Hillary yelling at a cop. Fucking crazy shit.

I've asked several dermatologists in the past about taking Vitamin D supplements and was told that there is no direct affect on psoriasis if you take it. However, a lack of Vitamin D lead to depression, which can lead to depression. And in that case can help clear some.

Like the original show, which is one of the things that made it great!

I watched this entire new series and my conclusion is that it shouldn't be binge watched. It reminded me of old school shows where every weak was an "oh shit, we fucked up, gotta get out of trouble" episode. This gets frustrating when binge watching. 

I enjoyed it, but could only do a couple of episodes at a time.

I'm 37 and live in Manhattan, and I've had pretty good success with the ladies in my life. But this particular date was only a few months after I left my ex-wife and was still getting used to dating again. So I do feel like I missed a few cues perhaps about what she actually wanted. It was just an overall odd experience and more akin to what the original comment we're all commenting on speaks about. That after further consideration, there really wasn't that connection that I thought. Which is fine. 
Were you a teacher before making the move? 
I wasn't necessarily ghosted but I had a similarly confusing experience. Meet this beautiful girl on Tinder, we meet up for light dinner and some drinks. And we hit it off. I'm walking her back to her place, making out on the way. She doesn't invite me home which is fine. I wasn't expecting anything else on the first date.  We make out again and I go home.

I felt pretty great about the night, then the next day she sends me a text, "Not really what I'm looking for so don't want to see you again."

I wasn't mad because I didn't get to know her enough to be angry, but the whole process was a bit soul sucking and confusing. 
I just read that in his voice... I hate you now. 
I have another question. If he does find something out of his jurisdiction, is he obligated to pass it on to someone who does?

Chris Matthews is unbearable to watch. Between his hyperbolic hypotheticals to his constant plugs for whatever RFK or JFK book he just wrote, he adds almost nothing to the discussion. He's so bad that other MSNBC talking heads make fun of him on their shows.

There is an amazing documentary called The Boys of Baraka that takes a few inner city boys out of Baltimore and into a private school in Africa. The results are interesting.

He's waiting to receive his opinion from the experts on Fox and Friends. 
Absolutely, and that's why now should be the time for an actual politician to be showing more face and becoming the leader of a movement. But there is so very little influence and leadership being shown by anyone else. 
This is the first time I've even heard of Ben Shapiro. Having just looked him up, I wouldn't shit on him for being 18 and having aspirations. I would shit on him for his views. As I support Hogg for his views, and the fact that he is getting that message across to millions of Americans. 


The kid is 18 and seems to have certain aspirations. You expect him to be a seasoned advocate or leader? Of course he's a light-weight. But he jumped into the ring and is carrying his own. And what does it matter if he likes the way he looks on TV? Again he's 18 and in order to do what he's doing, it takes someone who is not afraid to put themselves out in front of millions of people. 

Exactly. This doesn't downplay the work these kids are doing. Unfortunately, the message needed to be amplified with the blood of their peers. I hope these young men and women keep their momentum.

Being in finance might give you the flexibility to choose. And if you are in such a position, then you shouldn't worry about healthcare. Any decent company will have an adequate healthcare plan/ option. As far as workplace culture, this can vary greatly. I live and work in NYC and work culture is pretty intense. And from what I know and see from the financial sector, it's even more intense. But the money is really, really good. 
What places were you considering moving to?

“My kid and two other students walked out of their rural, very conservative, public school for 17 minutes today,” Greer (one of the student's mother) wrote on Twitter. “They were given two punishment options. They chose corporal punishment. This generation is not playing around.”


First of all, I support these students and their walkout. But the students don't have any rights in this case. During school hours, the school administrator is responsible for the well-being of his/her students. In most of the cases across the country where students walked out, administrators simply turned a blind eye. 

I work with public schools in NYC. Yesterday I was visiting a HS and spoke to some principals who were telling me about their students walking out early that day. One principal shared an interaction he had with a student who was afraid they would get in trouble for walking out and kept asking the principal if he was going to discipline them. The principal could not tell them they were free to walk out, but he also told them he would not punish them. 

This prinicipal in Arkansas is an asshole, but unfortunately he's probably in the right according to his state's laws. 
Going cold turkey is an option, but your might find yourself becoming more depressed and feeling more miserable and/or angry. So unless you can occupy your time to the fullest extent I wouldn't consider this. 

In your dating profiles be honest. Say what your plans are and what you want to do. It's important to state that you might not be around in a year or two. But I would continue to look around for a potential short-term partner or FWB. And honestly, you might actually find a woman whose goals align with yours.

Or just die of ill-health much sooner.  
I just switched back from google music to spotify. Spotify makes it much easier to discover new music, and the playlists IMO are worth it over Google Music. 
Money pays for training, oversight, and fixing the problems. And it's an internal problem that isn't being addressed, then someone (with authority) needs to step in and put pressure. And why is human error still an issue when we have the technology to automate most of it? 
Because it keeps happening, over and over again. They control funding, so don't make it sound like they're impotent and incapable of addressing solutions. 
So you're saying that our political leaders have failed us in following up and finding solutions to these deadly problems?
Yes prevent, we've had 3 deadly Amtrak accidents in less then two months. Perhaps we should try to prevent anymore people from dying. We can both grieve and act like grown ups at the same time. 
Wanting to prevent these events is not having human feelings?

This country has always been like this. I remember being a small child like 7 years old, and hearing a man tell my Puerto Rican father, who was not only raised in NYC, but also served in Vietnam to speak English or GTFO. The guy didn't care that my father was an American veteran. And I also doubt the man would have made the comment to anyone from the German community nearby if they weren't speaking English. This was 30 years ago. 
I recently, in the past few weeks, had this revelation. I know many people are able to fit in a workout routine in their schedules, but I either am too busy or too lazy to do so. But even as a reach 40, all I need to do to keep in shape is work out moderately for a couple of weeks every few months to look physically fit. And I attribute it to me playing sports and working out all the time when younger.
She's not even the worst demon he's spawned. His son is an even more terrible monster.
Yeah, that's the fucking point of a sanction. Because, you know, they're actively engaging in a cyber war with us, and we're doing jack shit about it. 
Republicans might have popular opinion swaying against the law enforcement among their base, but Mueller and the FBI don't fuck around. Mueller's team is the best of the best. If they wanted to get deep state on Trump, they totally could. I don't think they'll have to nor am I suggesting that actually would do something like that. Just thinking that finally Trump is going to get royally outsmarted. 
This is what happens when a spoiled rich bro is in charge. He's never had to answer to anyone before and now he's fucking with the wrong people. If the republicana weren't protecting him and themselves, he'd already have his feet to the fire.

Inferiority complexes, it's almost impossible for them to admit that they could be wrong, and/or not be the best and brightest. This isn't isolated to conservatives, but if their philosophies and ideas are also based on paranoia and fears, they never feel capable of opening up.

> Unemployment skyrockets in the last of the Bush years. Obama takes over. Unemployment drops every year he's president. He leaves, unemployment continues to drop. Somehow this translates to "Trump made unemployment the lowest it's been in years!" The fuck kind of logic is that? Like if I build 90% of something, and you come in at the last second and put the last nail in, somehow you built it? Nah, son. Don't work like that.

I'm 37 years old. Have lived here most of my life. Have worked in non-profits and philanthropy for about ten years now. Not once ever have I heard about a Trump sponsored charity, event, grant, initiative, etc. This man has never shown any inclinations that he actually cares about anybody but himself.

Which I wish Democrats jumped on during the entire tax cut debate. The tax cuts for regular folks is short term/ temporary but permanent/ longterm for corporations. And the GOP had no problem saying that it's easier for regular people to adjust short term. Which is complete bullshit. People need to plan exponentially as well. 2019 is going to be a nightmare of a year. 
Well, ideally we would be getting an influx of tourists willing to take advantage of the weak dollar right about now. But instead they're refusing to visit this country because they rather not deal with our backwards government and people. But now Americans can't afford to travel abroad, so we'll just spend our dollars here and experience the best of our crumbling infrastructure across the divided states!

That 33% radical base of Trump supporters are being prepped for violent backlash. Everything they believe in and support is going to be shown to be a front for foreign meddling for destabilizing our government and society as a whole. So between Fox news and its Deep State and xenophobic rhetoric and the NRA's pro-violence stance, these mouth breathers are going to react in the worst possible ways. 
Honestly, Canada might want to pay for that one.

The Waltons have more money than god. Perhaps they should pay their employees enough and provide enough benefits so that they don't require public assistance. And perhaps we should just have universal healthcare so that it's not tied to employment. And it's not the government giving handouts to people living at or below the poverty line, you heartless fool, but that we give handouts to companies like Walmart. 

As far as buying from them... I haven't shopped at Walmart in at least 8 years. So that's not a problem for me, because I live in an area with many other options and I make a decent living. But for many people neither is an option. 

And as soon as automation is cheaper and more beneficial for Walmart, they will. So they aren't employing people out of altruism, but because it keeps making them richer. [Walmart does more harm than good.](http://www.epi.org/publication/the-wal-mart-effect/)

I didn't mix it up. I specifically put down Net Worth and value. Profits are paid to shareholders in dividends and the Waltons are the top shareholders of Walmart stocks.

Totally, fuck the Waltons. (not /s)
The Waltons are worth around $140 billion. Surely you couldn't expect them to take a cut in value to improve the lives of thousands of hard-working Americans. 
Trump is an armchair quarterback POTUS. Thinks he can play the game, but instead crumbles and cries when actually put in. 
He's not lying. He's trying to shield the GOP and himself from the Russia Investigation. 
Well then if it's just the raw data, then it's best for them to destroy it. Let's just hope they're competent enough to do that correctly... I'm guessing they don't.
Find data? They would have had to look. They were never going to look. There is nothing to destroy except empty folders.

All they show are conspiracy theory shows. Everything is about ghosts, or bigfoot, Jesus, the Bible, and even when they are actually delivering something based on reality, they need to taint it... "Was Nikolas Tesla murdered over his death ray?" 

Our country will remain very ignorant and stupid as long as our cable networks are allowed to spew such bullshit and sell it off as informational/ educational. 
thanks! good catch!
The pivot from the RNC on Trump was just too severe. It's one thing to fall in line with party politics, it's another thing to begin to grovel so openly and praising Trump like an Emperor King just a few months after they were talking so much trash about him. They're all complicit. 

EDIT:a word
Remember the sniper in Dallas? One can argue they were just exercising their 2A rights. All hell came raining down on them. MOVE in Philly in the 80s had bombs dropped on them by the police. Tulsa race riots in the 20s lead to blacks getting firebombed by air. Oppressed people have been getting destroyed by the US government since the beginning of our country's history.

You need to remember that these black Alabamians have been hearing this rhetoric thier entire lives from thier state's politicians, law enforcement agencies, and a large part of thier white neighbors. They have been disheartened by politics and the country for a long time. Roy Moore and his ideas are not new to Alabama.
Yeah this is a feature not a bug in their eyes.
I'd be surprised if he's never killed a prostitute.
I agree with you. The Dems morally superior standpoint is reactionary as well. They should stand behind the laws and legal process, things that the right do not believe in. Ignoring the preying on teenage girls, Moore was kicked off the bench twice for not following constitutional law. That alone should make him ineligible to hold public office. So like you said, the right doesn't give a shit. That doesn't mean that everyone else should stop giving a shit as well. Because the right will be willing to play chicken all the way. 
I'd argue that we live in the golden age of lazy citizens. The data and science behind climate change is readily available. It has been reported for years. We have concrete and solid information at the tips of our fingers, but our citizens, incapable of rational and critical thinking, and lacking experience with scientific research, only respond to the loudest noises and shiniest images.

50% of Americans don't believe in evolution. 33% believe everything our POTUS says. We really have a stupid, lazy, and paranoid American population making the decisions for us who already refuse to accept that they might not know as much as they do. 

And the right feeds off that, and panders to them. Feels vs. Reals.
I wish we could just adhere to allowing due process for those officials already elected into office, this goes for both Trump and Franken regardless of the levels of the allegations. 

For Moore, who is running for public office, the public is already playing the role of jury when they go to the ballots. So he should be judged there. If in office, then again let the investigations begin.

We need to be a nation of laws, not reactionary to propaganda. 
Apparently it means Salmon in this case. 
"Temporary derailment." A derailment of any kind can be incredibly disastrous, with many many dead. The hell...

Because he needed it to be on public record that he is absolutely NOT GAY, just in case anybody has any doubts when they end up finding him in a shitty motel with some underage kid he's merely counseling. 
doh!

Sounds like she was impressed. 
Geez, what an insecure loser. 
Hmmm, I'm beginning to think that Trump might be a racist. 
> "We have to tend to this garden of democracy or else things could fall apart quickly," 

God I miss having an eloquent POTUS. Obama has such a great grasp of the language which is pretty good for a Muslim from Kenya. /s
It ate all it's peas, otherwise it wouldn't get any pudding. 
They should also form a supergroup, Stipe, Morello, and Nash. 
Yeah but according to Fox News, Trump IS the State like in any other dictatorship. 
In this Administration, the most obnoxious person in the room is always standing behind the podium. 
Thank you for your reply. I did mean standards for elected officials within a zero tolerance lens. The evaluations would depend on the evidence collected. This is a good discussion that should be had as it opens up an example of the proper use of critical thinking skills and evidence-based research, two things that are lacking greatly among the general population.  
And Republicans aren't calling to investigate their own. Which demonstrates the clear distinction between the parties in this case. 
What's your favorite spy novel? And why do you have such beautiful eyes?
Regardless I would like an investigation into all these claims. I want to believe him, but I can't hold him to any different standards. I also think that Republicans in similar circumstances (already in public office) should be investigated before asking them to resign. 


Putin probably told him to help destabilize the region. Then they team up and bomb the shit out of it, coming out as heroes and everything would be absolved. Trump, being the moron that he is, agrees. This also destabilizes us further, empowering the Russians globally. 
Didn't know that was there.

Aquinas was also very much influenced by the Greek philosophers. As were our Founding Fathers. 
The reason I didn't want to touch it is because Western Civilization began to develop systems of rules and regulations before Christianity became a major player. And of course lawful civilizations developed in parallel around the world without the help of Christianity. And I'm not trying to group all Christians into one bucket. My initial comment was specifically on evangelicals, which we could possibly look at their work in Uganda to see what kind of world they'd like to create. 
>Christianity had a civilizing influence on western culture.

I'm not even going to touch that one. 
http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/11/politics/kfile-roy-moore-kevin-swanson/index.html

Between this, gender reassignment surgery, the bombing of abortion clinics, and that republicans are more likely to support the death penalty, I'd say they go all in on the hate. 
Only because the Evangelicals are still restricted by our nation's laws. If they had their way, how do you think they'd treat homosexuals, non-Christians, and women? 
They'll celebrate because it's either proof that the Deep State exists and/or that it's the fault of the new Democratic majority congress. 
It's partisan because of religion. The evangelicals are no better than the Muslim extremists they so fear as competition. 
But I'm keeping my own image rights!

Trump is the face of the GOP. He's exactly what their base wanted and chose. They can only retain them if they go all in with their leader. Plus, based on how many of them keep jumping in line and bending over backwards to help DJT, I would not be surprised if much of the GOP is compromised in the same way. 
I'm investing in kneepads and stretching my jaw in anticipation.

He's been reading up on the economic impact of one of the greatest wrestlers in WWF history, Jake the Snake Roberts. #jakenews
But our president says he rarely watches TV because he's reading documents! #Bakenews!
He talks like I do! Like a fucking moron.
It creates a weaker and more divided society. If any of these politicians truly cared and had an ounce of empathy for thier fellow humans they would be against this tax cut for the wealthy. We're living in incredibly disheartening times however.
He's going to win. And Alabama will forever be cemented in their stereotypes.
As someone living in NYC and having dual citizenship, I'm considering it. 
Wouldn't be so bad if they didn't create an environment for brain drain as well. But all their best and brightest leave to blue states, our populations keep growing, but our voice only grows more watered-down. 
Those poor old men are about a hundred years old, they probably thought it was a portrait of that weird orange man shaking their hands.

I would say it depends where you grow up in the United States, for the most part we don't have national curricula so history text books vary from State to state. I grew up in a multicultural urban area right outside NYC, so it text books included many stories that were more culturally inclusive.
Your mom probably shouldn't be president of the United States either.
I thought it was a well known part of our American history. I learned about them in school as a kid.
Well then you'd be wrong. We covered the Navajo wind talkers in elementary school in the 90s. 
In Kelly's defense, he ran out of crayons and adderall. 
I thought the URL read virgintoy and thought it was a bit brutal at first to assume this would only appeal to neckbeards. 
And he did it in front of a portrait of Andrew Jackson! The man drips stupidity. 
He tried to share an endearing story about how he had to ask John Kelly about the importance of the code talkers, and all the praise Kelly had for them... Because at 70 years of age, having spent his entire life in this country, and now running the fucking place, he had no idea who they were. 
Are we sure they haven't already?
Not just squeezed out financially, but left with debilitating debt. Debts that break people, makes them sick with stress, and kills then slowly in a country with a terrible healthcare system. 

What we're seeing right now is just pure evil.
Hunger overcomes fear.
And he believes the Central Park Five, who happen to be black and brown, who were proven innocent, should still have been killed. 
When desperation hits they'll turn on each other first. Then the suburbs. 
Most people on welfare are the elderly, disabled, or children. And the very few who are able bodied are underemployed. And the even smaller, much smaller percentage, of those that are just lazy or too useless to work honest jobs. They'll turn to violence. 

Do you even realize that we live in a society and therefore we all have an obligation to help, improve, and maintain order?
You think these people will get jobs? They're going to get violent. 
You complete me.
Yep, Trump specifically said that Jones is soft on crime. The guy that prosecuted KKK members who murdered little girls, 40 years later, because the entire state law enforcement and FBI were a bunch of racists in cahoots.





In some other post someone had a better idea to make them all work in a coal mine. 
Right and also I think most people aren't thinking about the scenario that I mentioned when entering their phone into facebook or linkedin. 
Phone book registries don't account for cell phone numbers, which most people now use as their primary phone. This is at least to my understanding. Using my own phone number, and my google fu skills which are pretty decent, i can't find any information as to who owns it. 
[do hers look like these?](http://www.startrek.com/uploads/assets/articles/BurtonMission2.jpg)
The only reason that I could imagine that would make Trump afraid of there be a sex tape of him is that it will show what a disgusting body with a small penis he has. 
>They shouldn't be deciding what they think I might like.

That is literally Google's business model. 


I've gotten numbers from girls in a bar or from tinder, and not given there last names. Put it in my google contacts. Next thing I know they're LinkedIn accounts are being recommended to me, that tells me who they are, where they work, etc. There is huge security problem with this flexibility of open information. 
Easily have done it on purpose or by mistake?
Because it's not completely impossible to accidentally grab a person the wrong way when you spend all day long taking selfies with people.  But if multiple women came out saying he did this, then it's more than just a mistake or an accident. 

Regardless, it's not impossible that he did this. So I agree that he needs to be investigated. 
I would add that if Franken is that big of a creep that he would grab a woman in front of her husband and father, then he would probably do it all the time. If this is the case, then we need more women to come out and stand against him. 
I assumed it was a pretty common word.

Let me know if you need a deputy prime minister. 
Wait until you're 37 like me and are still asking the same question!
The Trumps are a tasteless and classless family. They fit in the gaudy, over-the-top, coke-fueled 80s. But now they're just a monster that should have disappeared along with that opulent time. Of course only people, from places whose styles and mindsets are barely out of the 80s would vote for him. Trump was still considered somewhat legitimate by the mainstream, his developments were followed with enthusiasm. Then everything he made started to fall apart, fail, and go bankrupt. The lawsuits and mobsters showed light and anybody with a brain finally knew he was a mobster-wannabe, spoiled brat with tiny hands and nothing to offer other than a caricature and brand.

Fuck him, fuck them all. 
Luckily they have a media outlet that instills fear and paranoia into its viewers.
What's the over under that only Puerto Ricans go to jail over this?
Who could have thought that thinking would be so hard?
That makes her smart.

I was always told that if I wanted to buy a Harley, I better learn how to be a motorcycle mechanic. Knowing how to fix your own bike is one thing, needing to know how to fix it because it's always going to give you problems is another. 
I agree to an extent. There are certain publications, shareblue being one of them, that I won't upvote unless they have some breaking original news, not necessarily because I don't agree with their rhetoric, but because the swayed tone does a disservice to the information being presented. 
See, you're comparing Shareblue, a small left-leaning news source to Fox news, a media powerhouse that is the "official" voice of the presidency and republicans in general. 

Shareblue is to MSNBC what Breitbart is to Fox News. And if you agree somewhat to my example and comparison, you could clearly see and understand that the levels of BS and made up shit are not remotely comparable between the left and right publications. 
Yeah but coupons for avocados, toast, and avocado toast! 
I don't upvote shareblue because I prefer my news to have a more neutral tone and lens. That said, they are not emulating Republicans' bullshit. As a whole, shareblue doesn't make shit up or create and share conspiracy theories. 
When they chant Make America Great Again, they're talking about the time in our history when only land-owning white men, most who happened to be Christian and owned slaves, were the only ones allowed to vote.

My mother moved out the country about 4-5 years ago, so during the election I kept her informed as to what was going on politically. She had spent roughly 30 years living and working in NJ/NYC and when I told her that Trump was likely to win. All she could say is, "How could anyone vote for that mobster clown?" It was so mind-boggling to her, and to me as well, how anybody could vote (and show trust) for a person who has had well-known ties to mobsters for decades. 
I feel like he might need to be waterboarded to both reveal the truth and to make him an honest man.

I wish I could remember the name of the show, but it was on Netflix. Called something like, "A Day in the life of a Murderer." And this is one of the cases they did an episode on. Really worth a watch if anybody can remember the name or the show. I'll try to search for it.

Link should work, so try again later. But I'll copy and paste the abstract of the paper here for you. It really is pretty fascinating. 

"Abstract
The amount and timing of sleep play significant roles in forming a solid foundation for competitive performance in young athletes. As children mature into and through adolescence, their need for sleep does not decline substantially, although the opportunity to sleep is limited by lifestyle choices, academic and practice schedules, and compelling changes in the biological processes. The biological changes include a more "permissive" pace for the accumulation of sleep pressure across the day in older adolescents and a longer day length in the more mature. These factors all favor later bedtimes and rising times as children pass into adolescence, and a concomitant delay in the optimal timing for waking activities. Among the important threats to athletic performance are insufficient sleep during training and competition and poor appreciation for the best time of day for competitive activities. The specific consequences of these issues for individual athletes are not clear, though when considering young people as a group, support for adequate sleep is a rational intervention to maximize performance."

I don't understand why people don't get this simple math. Let's say it is universally agreed upon that Bitcoin is going to go up to 10k, and you're only going in now to invest 6k into it. You're likely to make a 65% profit. For the same profit in XRP right now with it a 6k investment, it would have to go up to .33 Which doesn't seem farfetched in the not so distant future. I don't know if XRP could ever hit the 1$ mark, but if it goes to .50. That's a pretty damn good ROI right now on a much more stable coin on a much better platform/ blockchain with much greater longterm potential, especially once regulation really begins to gain momentum.

They wanted their piece of the pie. A piece that they felt was overwhelmingly being distributed to other poor people who don't live in places like they do, and who more importantly don't look like they do. They think those inner city poor people of color are living like royalty compared to them, without the same fight or struggle or feeling of despondency. Which of course is false. The poor are getting the short stick on all fronts by the actions of people like Trump.

About ten years ago I was driving cross country. Going through Missouri I was blown away with how many FM stations were talking about religion so I decided to check out AM... Holy shit.

Between that and every other billboard on the highway being about God, Jesus, and abortions all I wanted to do is get my ass to California already.

I worked for a small privately-owned company years ago whose owner was completely out of touch when it came to interacting with others. Every meeting only made morale go lower than the last, but one day he said he'd provide pizza on Fridays as long as we put in the hard work. Well, fine, okay we'll take the pizza. So we work hard that week, Friday comes... No pizza. Okay let's work harder the next week, again no pizza. A month or two pass and finally we bring it up in a meeting, "Hey, so what happened to the pizza."

"None of you performed well enough." We manufactured point of sales computers. You could see how the numbers had gone up over the past month or two. Needless to say, numbers started to go back down with morale. And I eventually got fired for telling him off.

I know, but you said CNN/Time Warner could lead by example. I was wondering if you had any data to base that comment on. And it's always quite possible that a subsidiary also has different benefits and perks made available to them. That's why I decided to split the two. Based on my own personal experience I would assume that people are underpaid in both, but I'm not basing it on first hand information from within CNN/ Time Warner.


For CNN? Time Warner in general? Or both?

I'm curious to find out more about the mother and why she won't talk to you. If I were in your situation, that's where all my focus would be. At the least your gf left you and is hiding behind her mother. Did you leave any messages with the mother? Did you tell her she's missing? If you did and didn't respond, have you tried visiting the mother? I don't think it's extreme if you are fearing for her daughter's life.

Ideally, a well-educated and informed populace would form groups to regulate the regulators.... Ideally. 
You told us what to expect.
Bless his heart. 
Couldn't agree with you more. Ripple is being built to survive just what you mentioned. A coin or two (most likely Bitcoin and Ethereum) will survive as sort of virtual tax havens, perhaps. But those coins who are working with regulators and have a real-world application are the ones that will most likely survive. Which will only be a handful. 
Yep, the day that XRP goes to the moon (for me) is the day that I don't have to go out of my way to exchange it for fiat. 
Everyone crying about XRP not skyrocketing right now are insane. If this coin is to succeed it can't be as volatile to every piece of news and speculation as the other coins. In fact, this lack of volatility is one of the reasons I prefer to go almost all in on XRP. Tie that in with an actual vision and business plan and it has all the signs for great success. As you said, the potential is massive. But anybody familiar with the business/financial world knows that such tech adoptions are tedious and slow. Again this is a good thing. 

Right now we have coins/ ICOs popping up left and right. This reminds me of the internet bubble of the 90s when websites and online services were popping up over night, becoming overvalued, and then poof they were all gone and only the strongest companies in regards to business models and long-term plans won. 
 
Supply circulation/ market cap. 

I feel that it's a very good sign that XRP doesn't fluctuate so much at every sign of new news and speculations. Volatility would be counter to the currency going more mainstream. But it's still growing, slowly, and if and when there is a much larger investment and adoption then the price will rise accordingly.

I actually ended up selling off a few days ago and put it into XRP. During or after swell when/if it hits a specific high, I'll sell what I had converted from LTC and reinvest in litecoin for longterm. And not touch anything for a good long time. 
Just over a month ago is when I began to get into cyrpto and got a bit swept up with the big surge that was occurring at the time. Began to buy into litecoin, and of course the litecoin subreddit added to the fervor with their memes and optimism (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). But aside from taking a hit from buying ltc as it rose, only to see the value plummet and continuously fall, I was trying to keep an eye on the long-term. In the meantime I also began to learn about ripple and xrp. And the difference in vision and professionalism between the projects were incredibly vast. Litecoin seems to bank on the fact that they have a faster and cheaper version of bitcoin, (the silver to bitcoins gold). But so what? 

XRP (and the subsequent fees) is much cheaper and ripple's tech is much faster. And they have a vision and business plan. They are getting big partners on board. They are getting media attention. And what is litecoin doing? Like you said, "Charlie Lee and his Twitter account."

I was on bistamp last night and realized that you can use tools on the tradeview. I drew a bunch of lines and discovered that I had no idea what I was doing. 

Frankly, one of the reasons I prefer to invest in XRP and Ripple is that it's less based on pseudo-science and BS speculation (to a degree.) 
NYC WTC? Where exactly? 
And that's the thing. Let's say it is hectic, and you're on line waiting to buy something. You look at your watch and it says you have 5 minutes to get back to the ship. Drop everything, buy nothing, and get back!
Also, and someone please correct me if I'm wrong because I'm really just learning about all this, but Ripple's tech and system would only be appealing if the transaction fee remains low. So if the currency being used, in this case XRP, keeps growing in value to the local fiat, those transaction fees would rise and cost banks more per transaction?

I couldn't imagine living in your situation. How could people from your small conservative town relate to him? We here can't relate to him and like it or not, he's one of us. Perhaps, it's because we're just so accustomed to dealing with bullshit out here? I feel that if you grow up in and around NYC that you must be consistently on the look out for scams and swindlers because of the sheer population density, there is serious and tough competition over everything. Forces us to be sharp or else we get run over. I hope i'm not making it sound that only smart or enlightened people can come from here. I don't believe that at all. It's just how, why can't those smart people you talk about not see right through him? 
I'm incredibly disturbed. These are the people who refuse to understand data, facts, and science. That's what is most disturbing. You can't convince them with evidence, empirical or otherwise. Frankly, it scares the shit out of me. 
Oh come on, of course they'll refuse. They refused to accept the facts that Trump is a failed-businessman, conman, wannabe mobster. And that's describing him kindly.  
Voting for this bill is considered a great honor for a congressional team.John McCain is hesitating,therefore voting is withdrawn!
You idiot, there is no "moon." 
Trump is in NYC slumlord mode right now. He wants conditions on "his property" to deteriorate so the tenants will die off or move out. Then he can go in and renovate and sell as luxury apartments.  He sees all Puerto Ricans like he saw the Central Park Five, just a bunch of useless minorities who deserve what they get regardless of facts.

As a NYC Puerto Rican, I'm livid right now. As a human, I'm depressed and scared.

well it's a meaty spot. 
I never met the guy who shot himself, but according to my buddy the guy was an asshole. And the owner was of course upset because a friend of his, killed himself, but he was much more upset because the asshole killed himself, inside of his place of business, with the owner's gun. Luckily the owner has good ties with the community and many cops go there to get ink. I don't think they questioned the story. 
They'd be easier to believe when they say that the free market will just regulate itself, if perhaps, maybe, they ever showed self-regulation by example. 
I send money every month to St. Jude's so some poor child and his family don't have to suffer more than the illness is already causing them. I can't believe I live in the world's richest country but yet this is something that needs to be done. It's shameful. 
I didn't witness this (thank god) but I was told and saw the cleanup the next day.

I was going to my local tattoo shop to get something done and when I get there, there are police cars and and an ambulance. My buddy who worked at the shop at the time sees me and just says, "dude come back tomorrow. I can't talk right now, but I'll tell you tomorrow."

So I go back the next day, he takes me to the private room they have for friends or VIPs of the shop and shows me a big part of the carpet that is missing. He goes on to tell me how this Hells Angel friend of the owner of the shop was hanging out the night before, drinking, getting some work done, when he decides to open a drawer and finds a revolver. He takes out all but one bullet and goes, "hur hur" before spinning the chamber, putting the barrel to his temple and pulls the trigger. Well he lost.

Interesting and thanks for sharing. I had a similar conclusion to what is said on that video. Where the Ripple technology is very independent of xrp, and really doesn't provide a clear cut opportunity for xrp to grow. 
I've been trying to make greater sense of xrp over the past few weeks and am still on the fence. If you don't mind, why do you say that it ain't that great?

I went into crypto with the idea that I could potentially lose whatever I put into it. With that in mind, I set a limit within my budget where if things work out, I could make a nice chunk of profit. If it fails, then I'm out of 1 weeks pay. 

And in response to your having fun comment. I totally agree and had the thought last night when I was watching the dip, how I've been enjoying myself for the past month reading, setting up accounts, etc. 

That said, crypto seems way too volatile for investors to be continuously positive and any people, IMO, should enter this market with much more cynicism. 

When I was a kid over 25 years ago, our apartment building had a soda machine and a cigarette machine in the lobby. I've seen laundry rooms with detergent vending machines. This fake-ass "Bodega" isn't anything new. And the only thing putting real bodegas out of business are rent-hikes. 
I like the Comeydore better.
This doesn't fix it, but it will allow you to get into the wallet if you want to do something right now. The first time I did this, I had no problem as long as a used my fingerprint to open the wallet. But as soon as I hit pin, it went back to just 1,2,3. 
If you uninstall it, and recover with your passphrase you get to reenter a pin, or move your coins around. At least I was able to do that on my pixel when i encountered the same issue. 
Trump is a lie incarnate. From his hair, to his skin color, teeth, and the size of his hands. The man has never been trustworthy and yet... here we are.

He's just following this administration's MO.
Bush Jr. wanted the war to make his daddy love him more. Cheney and friends came up with the justification, which benefited those who you pointed out. My argument is, how stupid was Bush Jr really? If he's as stupid as I think he is, he was also lied to. If not, then you are 100% correct. 
What I mean about well-meaning, is that he wasn't actively doing things he thought were going to hurt the US. I feel that he felt he was doing something good for the country. Problem of course, is how much of an idiot he was. 
Bush Jr. seemed like a well-meaning idiot. Trump is just a scumbag asshole, idiot.

Experience with public education, classroom teaching, program management, computer science education, and curriculum design for adult learning.
It's a reference. Upper management is right below CEO and Senior Executive. I said upper management can make upto 5x of 200k or 1 million dollars a year. Up to because it depends on the company. 

But having worked in the private for profit world, the private non-profit world, and currently as a public servant who works directly with superintendents I have experience with all this. And just for reference, my experience is in NY/NJ/CA where salaries and the cost of living are higher. 
>No, that is actually the problem lol.

You know what... I have to agree it is a problem. But not in this case. 

>You shouldn't be paid 200k for that job.

Why?

>You're going to have to provide a source that upper management makes 1mil a year on average.

http://chiefexecutive.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CEO_CompReport_ExecSummary_2014.pdf


Stop, it's not that certain people are making too much money that is the problem. That salary in most places exists because it's a competitive position that requires experience and skills. Now if they aren't doing their job, that's a different issue. If they here through nepotism, that is another issue.

The real problem is that people in this country, in general, are underpaid. That superintendent job is upper management. In a private company they could make 5x what they make working for public schools. 
We've been trying to hire for a very specific admin job here in NYC, starting salary is around 82k+. Because of the skills necessary for the position, it's almost impossible to find people who will take it for that "little" pay. Many of us on the team are here because we want to see the project we work on succeed, but we could easily make more in the private sector.  
And are expected to do more work. Public school teachers do a lot, but most principals also respect/fear their unions. No union to fear in most private schools.

That's the part that pisses me off the most, and what I've emailed my ticket rep about. At least make a half-assed effort to appease your fans instead of telling season ticket holders that they can 1) trade for another match (i'm a season ticket holder! I don't need tickets for other matches) or 2) just accept the automatic refund because they rather play to an empty stadium.  
As a NYCFC fan, I might have to go to the match on Friday in my old Whalers jersey. 
I rather fly to a match in England, than take the bus to Connecticut. 
Just in time to renew our season tickets!
Just heard the round trip bus they're "providing" costs 10 bucks. What a slap in the face. 
That's not going far enough. 
Police overtime pay, EMTs, fire department, clean up crews, and subsequent legal issues will surely be worth all that money those sufferers of economic anxiety will take with them.

I was actually listening to the Wall yesterday specifically for how much In the Flesh reminds me of Trump.

If tomorrow the FBI says they found evidence that Donald Trump had killed and buried 20 hookers in 1996, very small percent of people would be surprised. 
Aww, now I want to see them play nightcrawlers in the Oval Office or in prison, preferably prison.
I had arguments with fellow hispanics leading up to the election for them supporting Trump. One of my arguments would be that if we walked into the room with Donald Trump. No matter how much we kiss his ass, no matter how rich we may be, and no matter who we are, he's only going to be thinking of one thing, "you're spics." I feel this way now more than ever.

We need to start calling Alex Jones by what he really is, "A Reptilian." 

Also, this seems pretty staged. 
No, instead he doubled down. Said something like, "well they confessed." Never mind the facts. 
Not once, ever, has he shown any real sense of compassion or empathy towards another person. I would love to be proven wrong on this. But Trump is a sociopath through and through. I really hope he and his family all go down and have all their assets taken away. 

He's such a disgusting human, all us Americans should be ashamed to have created an environment where a person like him is even given the time of day to share his thoughts or lack thereof.  


Because they aren't all racists, some of them are just sexist. 
I try to mention the Central Park 5 as often as I can here on Reddit because it seems like a such forgotten insight into who Donald Trump really is and his views towards inner city minorities specifically. I'm glad Mr. Salaam is speaking out right now. He was the only of the 5 that didn't admit to anything at the police precinct because his mother showed up and saved him. 

Trump wanted the Central Park 5 dead. If he could have, he would have rounded them up (not himself because he's too soft for that) and had them murdered in public. And despite all the evidence showing their innocence, Trump refuses to admit any wrong. Fuck that racist piece of shit. 
Cut to a scene of Tiffany walking away from the prison where her family has been locked away. As she steps forward, her once crooked posture changes and her leg begins to straighten little by little. After all this time, Tiffany Trump was actually Kaiser Sosa.

It wouldn't hurt him in the slightest. And frankly, it's the last thing we should all care about. But that money trail, that's where his fear lies. That is what can take him, his family, his cronies, and his puppet masters down. 
Of course it is. The pee tape would do nothing to Trump. But the money laundering, and other shady financial deals, that's the real threat to him.

I work for the NYC public school system. First keep in mind that it's massive, we have over a million students and something like 1100 schools.

One of my buddies from the Atlético Madrid supporters club here in NYC is friends with one of the trainers who came over with Villa before going back to Atlético. When my buddy was in Spain, he got to hang out with the trainer and met Torres, who apparently had many questions about the MLS and NYC. This was before last la liga season. Of course this means nothing, but I wouldn't rule Torres out.
Apparently it's the fault of the Democrats for not speaking mouth-breather. These are the same people who refuse to understand basic science. I've been independent my whole life, voted for both parties. But currently there is no way that they are remotely the same. I like to vote with science, facts, and data. And only one major party is offering that right now. 
Democrats, "please read this to gain a better understanding." 

Republicans, "fuck you, I don't have to read shit to understand anything."

And somehow it's the "intellectuals" fault for not translating facts and data into a finger puppet show.

Anytime I take a new job I go in with the idea, "I'd like to not look for a new job for at least x years." This is usually 2-3 years, so after 1 year I start investigating options. As soon as something better comes around I jump ship. They've always replaced me with someone cheaper and less productive. So I feel justified that I've done what is best for both parties.
Yeah I've worked in education/ non-profits for almost a decade now and there were times I was left out of meetings that I should have been in because of my gender. Did it bother me? Yes. But I also work with technologists and scientists and see how women are discriminated against in that world. 

Bottom line is that you have to be aggressive if you feel left out and jump ship if it's the only way to progress. That said, I've worked with and for some amazing women who have had my back and who have had to fight extra hard because of thier gender.
