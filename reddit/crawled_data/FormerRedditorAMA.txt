I personally moved over to Verge for now because there's supposed to be some news tomorrow but I will definitely try to get back into XDN shortly after.  
I sure hope so
Sold at 585 ;) will try to get back in around 400 satoshi if IÔ∏èt goes down again
How do you think I feel after I made a few thousand dollars constantly buying and selling my Cardano each time with less.  Started off with 30,000 ADA and worked my way down to about 5,000 ADA.  Could have had $40,000 from my original $1500 investment at around $0.05 cents.  The feeling went away but man was IÔ∏èt shitty.  Would have been able to quit my job and pay off all my student loans and then have a bunch left over (not that I would have cashed out üöÄ).  
Really happy I got in yesterday around 500 üöÄ
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but that right there is what‚Äôs known as a correction
Dod?

Definitely, I would say it's quite undervalued at the moment and it's showing good support levels.  
I'm using Bittrex but I'll sign the petition!
About to sell all my Verge for 53,000 XDN
Sold my LTC today to go into TRX but was super bummed that they weren‚Äôt allowing new accounts for the time being.....until I remembered I made a binance account about a month ago 
Why not just USD Tether ($USDT) 
!Remind me 14 weeks
At my Staples, we don't do that but we get shit on everytime someone buys a laptop without services.  Because apparently, it's my fault they don't want to buy a $299 accidental protection plan on their $300 i3 HP.  It's normal to get a training session afterwards on how to sell better.  
I hope so too but I don‚Äôt think they should be allowed to use deadlines anymore
Preach
Not this guy (.18/.19)
Weird, my old Motorola was slow as fuck after a year.  My iPhone that's 3 years old (with original battery) still feels nice and snappy.  If it got slow one day then I'll just order a $25 battery w/ kit off of Amazon and it'll be back to the normal clock speed.  
How much did you lose?
True story, just did this yesterday.  Would just pay the $0.25 but it was $1.50 and was like fuck da
You do any shitting?
Do you have to pay capital gains even if it‚Äôs sitting in exchange and not converted to fiat yet?
Think it‚Äôs safe to say that patience DOES indeed pay off lol
Even if IÔ∏èt dips down to 1000 resist the urge to sell, you‚Äôll thank yourself down the road
This, my 30,000 Cardano would have been worth $18,000 if I had just held IÔ∏èt and I sold IÔ∏èt for a nice little profit and bought back in with much less units.  Profit is a profit don‚Äôt get me wrong but I totally fucked myself by playing the market.  Not about to make the same mistake with this coin.  
Isn‚Äôt $50 in a year a little crazy?  I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong that would be fucking amazing and that‚Äôs Tesla money right there but isn‚Äôt $50 too much?
Preach
Not stupid at all!  There really isn‚Äôt an app yet to buy Cardano so I just used my iPhone to buy it on Bittrex.  It works fine but it‚Äôs a lot of pinching and zooming.

Computer works best though
Steak burrito with brown rice, pinto beans, mild sauce, corn, cheese, and sour cream.

Would go again
Well, that was fast...
Bull run to the moon
That wall came down faster than IÔ∏èt went up
Shit all you would need would be a 5-7 minute heist setup / update related mission that ‚Äúrequires‚Äù this rocket powered truck for some reason and you‚Äôre good.  Not only will this make IÔ∏èt ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù but if you complete the mission you can get IÔ∏èt for a discounted price!!
I bought 23 at $45, sold at $47 and went into other cryptos.  Yesterday bought $500 worth when IÔ∏èt was $150 and I already made my money back and then some.  Can‚Äôt wait to buy the dip.....if there even is one.
Wanna be the first millionaire to say hi to me?
I hope so, I just watched my stake in BTC go from 0.16 to 0.29 (thanks to ADA) and then down to .09 BTC (thanks to me being an amateur) 

Currently holding 15k ADA 
Yeah 20 cents is being super bearish 
I am almost certain that IÔ∏èt will be at the very least 20 cents by the end of 2018.  
Khajiit has wares, if you have coin
As a bittrex user IÔ∏èm extremely salty because I wanted to buy some iota when IÔ∏èt was around $ 0.40 cents but I couldn‚Äôt D:  I was lucky enough to make a pretty penny with Cardano though 
Any particular reason why?  And what price did you get in at?
I sure hope so, would love to get back into ADA at around 800 sats
Well, for starters its got a really great team behind it that includes some of the same people that helped create Ethereum.  If you look into it you'll find that it's the third generation of crypto-currency (Bitcoin being 1st gen and Ethereum being third) and it looks to solve some of the issues that Ethereum may run into down the line.  The other day it went up to around 15 cents.  I was fortunate enough to capitalize on it so I may be biased but I think it's a good choice for the foreseeable future.  
Why not?
Buy Cardano and that 350 has a good chance of turning into $700 someday
My 2 ~~cents~~ sats*
Unsettling sounds about right
Shave off what years?
How long would you say the coin stays down for?
>  

Same, I would have made the most if I just left the 30,000 units I bought alone and sold when it was at .15.  Instead, I bought and sold at different times each with a profit but with fewer coins each time.  I'm definitely not complaining though!    

Will re-enter when it eventually corrects and hold for the long term.  
Just keep in mind that there is significantly more ADA's circulating than there is ETH 
You‚Äôre 100% right.  IÔ∏è‚Äôm still pretty new to this so the emotional factor is definitely still present,  I think that‚Äôs what fucks me up the most.  
IÔ∏è bought 29k ADA at 579 and sold then bought sold then bought until eventually IÔ∏è stopped at 730.  Made over $200 in about 2 hours but would have had more if IÔ∏è just held on to the original 29k.  Right now just hoping IÔ∏èt will drop down to about 600 sats.  Don‚Äôt make the mistake IÔ∏è did!!
‚ÄúNo one ever lost money making a profit‚Äù

-Forgot who
As someone who bought at 35 this is too fucking true
This guys gets it

Will do, thanks for the tip
Just got a refurbished one on Amazon for ~$830.  Made the mistake of doing 12-month financing instead of 5% back so I might just be a bitch and go through the trouble of returning it and repurchasing another one (perhaps of higher specifications) to get some sweet % back.

I see what you're saying, staying there would potentially bring new skills and more money, thanks for your advice!
Yeah definitely want to be professional about it,  I'd honestly be fine without a job for a little and it would give me more time to focus on school and I could always find another job.  Thanks for the advice!
You're right, developers aren't supposed to draw extra attention to it.  In my opinion, I don't understand why so many people are annoyed by it.  We're getting so much extra screen space compared to the ~~iPhone 6~~ iPhone 8 design.  
Yeah but look how much they will end up saving with the More account and Squaretrade

I bought 40 NEO at 33 for 0.26 BTC a day before it dipped...I could have had 77 NEO
Yes.
Did you just assume my education level?  Looking at it now, 53 is a pretty good entry point, best of luck!
Not sure if sarcasm or insult probably both
Don't feel bad I bought 23 LTC at 45 and sold at 47 about a couple weeks ago ...

Another day or so until my bank account gets verified.  I'll wait for a tiny dip and throw another $400 in.  ;)
You're right the gains are ridiculous, I only have 3.89 eth tho :(
Thanks!  How much do you have? (If you don't mind answering of course) 
I didn't realize that by doing an Id verification on Coinbase they increase the weekly limit to $500 so right now I'm at 3.89 ETH!!
Thanks, dude, I'll look into those.  I heard it mentioned a few times that Polo might be going down? or something along those lines, I could be completely wrong tho.  
Thanks dude I really appreciate it, have you personally ever used this site before?
The issue with that is coinbase limits you to $150 a week with a debit/credit card.

Unique art style, almost every picture has no people in it.  
Assuming he got the game at launch for 60 bucks (current price on steam is $5).  6,392 hours of gameplay would come out to 0.009 cents per hour so a thousand hours would cost around 9 bucks.  Since op said he got it for him 2 years ago but if instead he got it for him at launch then at this rate he would have accumulated 47,940 hours which is around 5 years, that means this game is taking up 1/3 of his time, what a fuckin noob
Mental
I agree, they're definitely gonna come out with a new mechanism for the bands but I don't think it's gonna be after 2 generations, at least I hope not.  
Yeah the worst part is when the rest of the store has to come over and help you and then it just makes you look bad even though there was nothing you could do about it, I once got in trouble for dimming the lights after closing when a customer was still in the dressing room lol.  
The dry week you described would be an upgrade to me, I could talk about technology with a stranger for free.  Definitely better than standing in a fitting room for an 8 hour shift just to have the last person leave after close with a cart full of inside out clothing (10+ pieces) and hangers that get stuck to the cart.  
I understand, it's just that at my job I've never had to do it in the two yeas I've worked there.  There are janitors that are supposed to do it but they're not there on weekends.  I know it sounds like I'm bitching about it but I learned after that it was there since they day before and they didn't even bother to clean it before any customers entered.  You should have seen it, shit everywhere, it was demolished.  If they told me when I was hired that I would be doing this sort of thing once in a while then I wouldn't have a problem with it.  Sorry for the rant and thanks for the advice!
Reason 1: I was supposed to be ringing, my shift manager tried to get me to do it by doing her a "favor". 2: business casual attire is not ideal for bathroom cleaning, last thing I need is shit to squirt all over a clean shirt.  3: it's not in my job description and I was the only male working st the time(mostly women) 
"...naked man and woman"  I always thought it was "everybody knows they can MAKE a man a woman"  Really sucks I have to find this out the day he died, RIP.
Honestly sounds like it makes the day go by fast.  The main reason I left my previous job of two years is because it was the exact opposite of that, it was so boring and repetitive oh and also mainly because they wanted me to clean the women's bathroom, that's what pushed me over the fence to leave.  It's been maybe a month since I left that job,  if they ask me why, how would you recommend that I tell management?  
Nice! What kind of stuff do you do to the computers, I'm assuming running virus scans and that sort of stuff?
Gotcha, thanks for the input
Thanks dude!  appreciate it!

I just bought a 15 inch MacBook Pro retina. But I got it for $900 and it was a 2013 model.  I was waiting for the new ones to come out like you but this deal came along and I pulled the trigger.
This is what I hate about Apple they add all these cool features in but they NEVER show you how to use them.  Another example of this is in photos when you want to select multiple images really fast.  To do it you just hit the select key and swipe all the images you want.  But there's no way I would have figured this out if it wasn't for reddit.  /rant
I just bought a early 2013 15" macbook pro retina for $900, deal or no deal?
Trick question, I'd rather be the dipshit with the lint in the pockets.

What keyboards are those?
Not sure but it probably would make it easier to get reception in certain areas.  
I actually just switched to T-Mobile  from Verizon 2 days ago.  It's pretty much the same for the most part.  Obviously Verizon has more coverage but it's not a night/day difference.  So far the only places where I get no service is inside of Copernicus.  If you don't mind toggling airplane mode once in a while to get it to reconnect I'd say go for it.  So much better paying 120/month for 4 lines with 10 gb each instead of 180 for 3 gigs shared.  
It looked so much better with the old one.

That would be pretty cool if he somehow managed to put the bodies inside of trees.  But it would be way too much work.
Could you post your resume please.  I would love to see what the resume of someone who has an interview at a company like that (Tesla?).  Thanks and good luck!
Are you saying that PC gaming is a walled garden?
What are some of the pros?
How so?  Wouldn't it be pretty cool to not have anybody in the store and have time to chat with other employees?

Does anyone know why he would do that to himself?

How big of an impact on battery life will this have?
Thanks!

Which repo?

What's the theme?

You'll find out how John Connor got his scar.  
I would check out the "Grey Market" first.  I was able to get the pre-purchase version of MKX for $15 a week or so after it came out.  
Also two questions

-Can you still do the thing where you drag the video down in the bottom corner and it still plays?
-When you're on somebody's channel does the top banner change colors to match their banner pic like on android?
Where do you live?

Not /u/mythekos but would be interested in some help with iFile :)
I got the robot class to work but letters & numbers but when I try to do it with enter it doesn't seem to work.  Not yet at least ;(
I'm gonna work on it later today. :D
Yeah I know, I just wanna get it worked out in the terminal first before I jump into GUI.  
I only did it once before but that program was using swing so that's probably why.  
I'm gonna give this a shot and get back to you.  What did you mean by "you'll have to have focus on the entry in order to make it register."?  Thanks for the help!
Oh ok, what about when the program eventually becomes an .exe will the raw mode transfer over?  Thanks for the help!
Hey!  That's just the empty array that it prints out when you don't hit enter and the timer runs out.  It's there for testing.  By "something other than [ ]" I mean the user's input.  When you can start typing theres a timer thats like 5 seconds and if you don't hit enter before that timer's done then it just outputs [ ].  If you hit enter before the time is up then it [prints,out,your,input,like,this].  If I could just force an enter before that timer is done my problem will be solved but the thing is I don't even know if that's possible lol.  
I guess that's what happens when you make your scanner static and put it above the main method..
Imagine how awesome it would be if Furlong didn't suck and he was in Genisys.  
Joy to the world...
Pg-13 tho

They could make a prequel to genisys with that?  But it would have to be all cgi.  
Turns out he's a real life terminator.  
It's literally a dollar.  
It's a good app but personally I find the interface hard to fall in love with.  
I don't really see why they would.  In my opinion it's their own notepad.  It's the same reason they won't port over their Alarm app.  However I would download it right away if they did port it over.
Is there any that let you play any song from the playlist?
You can supercharge spotify?
Sounds like something that would happen in one of my dreams...
Apparently the substrate just got updated an hour ago and everybody's shitting themselves and all the servers are dead.  
Yeah dude.  For a better understanding check out /r/jailbreak
How is it?  In terms of compatibility.  
Are you on 8.3 by any chance?
I wonder what iOS 9's adoption rate is gonna look like as a result of this.  I know Tim and his pie charts are gonna be happy.  
Unless you really need a new phone wait for the iPhone 6s.  It's only a few months away and its most likely going to be better.  If it's a flop (unlikely) then you can get the 6 for less.

I use this widget called counter.  It's just a simple stopwatch right there in nc.  I use it to keep track of my breaks at work. 
But..but I like my Kirkland watch :(
They should get rid of the numbers on iOS's clock icon and make it more like the one found on watch OS.  Much cleaner look imo.  
Agreed but I still don't understand why they gave the thugs completely different haircuts.  
You just described the feeling I have perfectly.  
Can you post a link to those monitors?
I like to take my life one upvote at a time..
They DID show an iphone 6 mounted to the pipboy..
Ha HAH I will downvote you because my android device doesn't have this game ha HAH /s
It's either a 13" MBP or an older 15" rMBP
It's been confirmed that sync for reddit is in development for iOS.

nope

How do you get MK1 Kano?
Thanks for clearing that up!
I see, thanks for the fast reply.  But what if you need to go back and edit the code?  Unless this is done at the final stage when it has been confirmed that the code works the way it should.  
How often does it get shrunken down to the 3rd form (x.v - q(x,t))?  Does this improve performance significantly?

I'm pretty sure that just means you're a bitch /s
Where I work theres this security dude that's certified or some shit and he's the only one allowed to make physical contact.  Funny thing is he's only there on select days.  
Before you go overpaying for more Razer gear I recommend checking out some other companies.
Why not just get the same mouse?  The Logitech g100s might do it for you though.  Also just out of curiosity, how long did that mouse last for you?
Have you looked into the Zowie ZA?  It comes in three sizes and just recently came out.  It's pretty similar to the FK's it's just that it has a more significant hump towards the back, kind of like your current mouse.  Also this mouse shoud be good for the grips you use.  
Extra ram module would provided the structural integrity required to prevent the bend.  Forward slash s. 
You bring up a good point but sadly you're gonna get down voted.  
Don't hate it just because you can't get it.  
It's not really supposed to.  It makes it less serious.  
Same, just cause it has a cooler wow factor than say reds or browns.  
I thought the za11 shares the same dimensions with the Sensei?
Pls tell me what you do cause this game seems to be getting boring for me and my friends.  
Nice, I just got a das 4 and I plan on returning it and getting a 60% board instead.  Most likely a Ducky mini (same one as you) or a Pok3r.  Brown switches.  
Oh nice, how much did you get it for?  Also what #?
First of all screw you for living next to a Micro Center.  Second, you should try contacting Ducky about the missing [keychain](http://i.imgur.com/NJ5vY2v.png).  They might be able to help you out.  
What is his actual license plate?
How are you liking the Pok3r op?  What are the keycaps like compared to other mechs?
Even something as simple as a red stapler laying around would do it.  
Plot hole:  if OJ  is talking German in the night , wouldn't they hear him when he was living in the garage?
Nice board!  It really sucks that you didn't get the keychain.  You should try to contact Ducky about that.  Also what number keyboard did you get?
cringe
I'm on the verge of buying either of the two.  Which would you recommend?
yeah you do
Germany?
Hey OP I just got the professional version of the same board a few days ago.  When you spin the volume knob do you notice that it's kind of crooked or not 100% flat when you spin it?  I'd appreciate your feedback because this has me on the verge of returning this otherwise awesome board.  Thanks.  
How much was it?  And how hard has it been adjusting to the smaller board size?
Are you sure abut that? /s
I thought that was a macbook pro 13 at first lol
One can only hope they make the iOS YouTube app prettier :D

God damn it I was set on buying the 13 pro this summer!

The perpetrator most likely used his keyboard sir. 
Worth the debt.  
Tell me more about this "Joe"
Oh my GOD!?
What's your job title?
You brought up good point
A green orge.. that would be interesting.
I interpreted that as "Every character dies after x amount of time" shyyt
Or it unlocks every hour or so of your characters life and you get the choice to wear the "skin".  Once  you die the beard items will disapear and the timer will reset.  Maybe after a few hours some options such as the "Clean shave skin" will disappear so you cant hide with the fresh spawns.  There would have to be a new category for this as well.  Maybe "Temporary Items".
These guys just don't give up huh? Lol
<bang>
What about your texture settings
Guess those classes didn't do shit after all lol
Okay, that's way too much ketchup

I thought the buttons on the back were there so that the bezels can be smaller than average?
which mouse is that?
They think it makes them a 1337 h4x0r cause it has a slightly higher learning curve than iOS.  
People can't seem to understand that the gap between iPhone's and android devices isn't as big as the one between consoles and PC's.  Owning an iPhone doesn't make you a peasant.

Very nice, IMO you should make the chrome icon's circle bigger and make the colored lip under the icons a bit slimmer
How do i get the google search bar on top?
Whoa did they update it the vechicles to support first person perspective?  

Everyone would just kill him?
thank you...
how big are all of the monitors op, including the one in the middle?  thanks
;)
OP, is that a Tekmat?
It's the one that came with the usb amp so its ~5-6 feet long.  I did some more research on this and I think the amp is picking up a radio signal.  It went away this morning but yesterday I got a very faint Fox Sports Radio broadcast that was a good minute ahead of their website.  There are other people that get this problem with guitar amps and other amps so I guess I just live too close to an AM tower or something.  I thought I was listening to a hacker's mic and they were listening to sports radio at first but I like to jump to conclusions way too fast lol.  Thanks for the help tho :)
ripped up your wrist? pls explain more
oh sweet looks so badass
Edit: I restarted my computer and it just comes back.  When I disable 'listen to this device' I hear it again.  I cant find anything online..
Holy shit what mouse pad is that

Are you telling me that I can log on right now and go cook some meth inside a camper if I wanted to?
fuckin magnets
Thank god (or should I say Duarte) I thought they were for real lol.    Sadly I bet there are a few of them who are serious D:
that subreddit makes me cringe
Is that it in the top left corner directly under that rock near the edge of the water with its head being the right most part of it?
I was more disappointed with the fact that they kept the ugly apex design w/ the jumbo space bar WHY Steelseries!?
In one of the fucking videos the guy said the light is centered on the key and as a result you will be faster to see and hit the key...
Am I the only one that thinks it would have looked nicer if the beer was in focus instead of the mountains?
nice!
lmao nice
Whats the pay like?
How often do you use that building to check the time?
Looks much better :D
Nice you did the thing with the circles on the app stores!  Another thing I noticed that might need some work is the calculator icon.  The original one is quite nice so I think you could maybe take that one and giver it the matte finish and make the black lines thinner.  Other than that looks good.  As for the name, I was thinking Flatte (matte+flat).  
Lol oh when you do the App Store and iTunes Store you should do them without the ring, it will be much cleaner.
Also the blue banner on top of the calender app should be a little bigger IMO
True, but you have to remember that this their air lineup and it didn't have a lot of power or an sd card slot to begin with.  I doubt that they will do this to the mbp.  
when you double click home button are the appp icons in the multitasking view the default ones or the custom ones?
I think that there are too many people who prefer the smaller size and too many optimized apps for them to just abandon the 4 inch market at this point.  
:(
Theres this thing called Alien Blue
Is that a 6 or 6 plus?
I'll be reverting it today ;)
Yeah I jailbroke my 5s about a week ago then just restored it to a backup through iTunes  to see how it worked and that's it you're back to normal with no traces of a jailbreak.  So easy.

What did bad company have that the newer ones lack?
/r/copythat
I was gonna get it yesterday but Best Buy didn't have any left so I ended up getting a razer deathadder chroma instead and so far I am quite impressed.  
How do you like that mouse
But rpetunderclass, Why not just get an android? 
You smart.
Probably claw-palm hybrid 75% claw 25% palm
I bought it and returned it a few days later.  The rubber coating was always slipperly especially after washing my hands.  Also the shape of it was kind of weird.  The sensor was good, no complains there but if I was you I would give the Corsair m65 rgb a look.  
Didn't read the title all the way and thought these were CS:GO skins at first lol
"probably"
Sure did, I go to sleep with 75% I wake up with 74%.  I charge it for 20 minutes it goes up almost 20% (5s).  Look at the 6 plus' battery, it's amazing!  Sure Android phones are capable of having good battery life but it's just not as consistent as iOS.  
What they could do is replace the final gold knife with other rare gold knives (karambit, cuntsman, butterfly)
Features, what features?  I'd rather be first in line for better apps.  Look at monument valley, android isnt even getting one of the level packs cause the developers said it's not worth it.  The amazing camera and battery life doesn't hurt either ;)  

also, their "weak ass hardware" outperforms android phones with superior hardware in benchmarks
I know right, fuck having a phone that has better apps and doesn't lag.  
Is it true that this is bad for the battery?
How does it work?
Copy that.
Thanks!
Aren't they all islands?
Well I can't argue with that logic.
Are those their gray or light gray key caps?
So you're the one who let the dogs out.  
It really depends on how lucky you get, my Sensei Raw (glossy)'s cord  crapped out after about a year.  If you're going for longevity then I would go for something Logitech cause of their awesome warranty.  I just exchanged a corsair sabre rgb for a logitech g502 at best buy yesterday and so far I'm pretty impressed.  
I don't get it?
Where was it used in the finale?
Oh shit, good eye!
Why would you start watching this late into the show?  
If this was compatible with chromebooks then I would have seriously considered getting one.
Cool, thanks!
where can I get the "google" keycaps?
rip in piss bitch
http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/spchless.gif
You know you can get the rgb version without the crab logo right?
what kind of a grip do you have?
Is there a subreddit for vids like this?
How much lag would there be you were to do this today?
Gotta love the silky blonde hair and the hot dog skin.  
I see what you did there.  
If they did it with RYSE and Dead Rising 3 then I can see it happening with these games as well, I just hope it's a decent port.  
Ubisoft made some bad choices and essentially turned into EA so everyone keeps saying they keep digging themselves into a hole they'll never be able to get out of.  
You should pitch the game to Ubisoft.  
Oh no, "Steps" is a standalone app.  The icon is a blue background with a white figure walking.  
One of my favorites is the Steps widget.  All it does is tell you how many steps you did today.  The app is really good too if all you want to know is how many steps you did in a week.  Plus there are no ads.  
[Reminds me of this](http://i.imgur.com/LoDZXKc.png)
If you do decide to take this route then keep in mind that the k70 RGB doesn't have that usb port on the back anymore.
Yeah I knew about this, it's a lot but it's very small compared to the google play store.  I just checked Instagram there and it has almost 16 million reviews.  I think this is because it's so much easier to review apps on the play store compared to the app store.  
Cool, you should give the app the ability to display more detailed information.  For example, say the apps says something along the lines of "It's going to rain today"  the user will want to know when it's gonna rain so you should give them that functionality so they don't have to open another weather app.  
How do you hear the alarm?

Is there a subreddit dedicated to this type of stuff?
Yeah it's kind of sad that something like this made it past quality assurance.

When you lay it flat on a table without a case, does it wobble around (sort of like a keyboard with only one of it's feet up) ?
oh, have you tried getting a replacement?
What do you mean by rub?
This happened to me the day Watch Dogs released
It's not plastic
Thank you for pointing me in the right direction,  I will definetely be trying out some of the stuff you recommended as well as some of your apps ;)
Good strategy I see how that will significantly increase the downloads and reveue.  But if you were someone who is about to release their first game and had limited marketing resources, how would you do it (well, how did you do it lol).  Thanks!

EDIT:  Just out of curiosity if you don't mind answering, how much revenue would you say you make a month?
How would you go about advertising / marketing a game that you're about to release?
If there was civilization there then all the billionaires would probably live on that small island.  
You could also go for the [Corsair one](http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Vengeance-Extended-Edition-CH-9000046-WW/dp/B00FK1E41U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1409593641&sr=8-1&keywords=corsair+extended+mouse+pad).  It comes in multiple sizes and the logo isn't obnoxious either. 
Oh cool, I didn't even know you could do that
That's a good point?
