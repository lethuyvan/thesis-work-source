Yeah, not gonna lie. I'm a bit salty about this. I poured hundreds of hours into Project Reality. If I had known about Squad on Kickstarter, I would have backed instantly.

I'm done. I've had enough. You can't just spam /r/HailCorporate and expect an upvote. You can't just be like "dude, you're playing a game?" and post /r/HailCorporate. You just can't.

I doubt you even work for corporate given how against them you are. You live in a cardboard box, typing on your CrapBook Pro, feeling good about yourself because you think you just "called someone else out" for being a corporate shill.

Just who do you think you are? Some epic 12-year-old on the internet with le cool fedora posting about how "corporate shill hails this, corporate shill hails that?" Well, I've got news for you. You aren't anything. You aren't epic, you aren't a 12-year-old, and your fedora certainly isn't le cool.

I hope in time you will learn that not everybody and everything is a corporate shill.

I wouldn't consider "do unto others as you would have them do unto you" to be altruistic at all.

What I meant by that is that things I wouldn't want done to me could be considered immoral. e.g. I don't want to be murdered, stolen from, scammed, lied to, assaulted, etc.

Obviously, morality is very subjective based on a person's conscious and upbringing, but I consider that to be a good baseline.

TASTEYBOI
Wasn’t today.

So, I was in a really large TESCO with my wife - we live in the sticks so every few weeks we have to venture out to this huge shop and do two weeks worth of shopping. It really hurts the wallet.

Anyway - there we were and I was bored as all fuck - So I decided to stop following my wife around with the overburdened trolley and just chill out. After a few moments I noticed a Granny with her two fairly young grandchildren walking behind her with the trolley.

The two kids (Brother and Sister) were fighting over who got to push the trolley which led to the trolley swaying from side to side. At one point the Boy (Who seemed to be the instigator) pushed the trolley across the isle and it nearly ran into a lady. The Granny went red in the face - apologized to the lady and started yelling at this kid. They got what they needed from my isle and wandered off , I didn't think much of it after that.

I got a text from my wife about ten minutes later - she needed help picking Mango's. Apparently I have a talent. So off I went. Lo and Behold, the Granny and the kids were there too - and you could see that the granny had had enough - she looked like Tyson, she was pissed. I didn't realise it at the time but the Mother was also in the same Isle.

Anyway - there I was - being a Mango picking God. When these kids start arguing right behind me, and it's really bloody distracting. I turned around and very polity told them to shut the fuck up.

The kid flipped me the bird - He couldn't have been more that 12 - which really pissed me off. So with a little on the spot thinking I positioned myself in front of his trolley and screamed like I just got punched in the dick. The grandmother's head jolted up and so did the mothers. Well - in for a penny, in for a pound.

"Could you please look where the hell you are going. Did you do that on purpose?" I asked the kid and I will never forget the look on that poor child's face. He went this kind of pinky purple colour and was right on the verge of tears.

At first the surrounding area went a bit quite - and then, without a moments delay the granny walked right up to me -apologized, yanked the kid away by his wrist and slapped him hard across his face. Then the tears came - his sister started too. They wailed and they wailed.

The mother (Who I had only just then realised was the mother) started screaming at the Granny.

"Who in the fuck do you think you are?" "Don't you ever touch them again." "I'll fucking kill you, you wrinkly old trout." The Granny wasn't getting a word in edge-ways. "But I was only trying too.." "They have to learn they can't just..."

I retreated away from the area as it was just getting worse - I dragged my wife away with me.

On our way to the tills 20 mins later, I saw that the police had arrived and were leading the Granny out in hand-cuffs. With the mother screaming abuse at her.

My bad.

TL;DR. I tried to teach a Kid a lesson in Tesco and got his Granny arrested and tore apart their family.

Judging by the cadence of the automatic fire, I would say it was converted from semi-auto to full auto. An automatic weapon is designed to fire at a specific rounds per minute. In the videos of this gunman the fire rate is very erratic and inconsistent.

>Unfortunately, seaweed isn’t a quick fix for our atmospheric methane overdose. We just don’t make enough. Scientists calculate that it would take some 6,000 hectares (about 15,000 acres) of seaweed farms to supply a mere 10 percent of Australia’s 29 million cattle; to supply America’s 92 million would take over thirty times more. While seaweed farming is a rapidly growing global industry, it’s not yet up to such herculean demands.

The Squad developers have been adamantly opposed to ranking of any sort from what I can tell, and I can certainly understand why. However, it does provide the benefit of being able to how experienced others are.

Badges seem like a good approach. A "noob" badge might come with too much stigma though. Others being dismissive of new of new players, treating them like children etc. So if something like this were to be implemented, I'd hope it was only visible to squad/fireteam leaders.
Badges sound like a pretty good idea.

I've actually started looking up my squad members playtime in Steam if I don't recognize them. That sounds a little weirder now that I type it out, but it certainly helps in gauging my squad's experience.

So let me get this straight. You think need to give some a special icon random to help baby sit your squad members, but you also trust that if they leave the next in line random (who previously needed to be baby sat) will be up for the task?

I'm sure you've been in a squad where the squad leader disconnects without warning. Then you have some guy over coms going "uhhh... I'm not a good squad leader but I'll try". It quickly turns into a disorganized cluster fuck.

A new visual designator won't solve anything that playing with even 1 or 2 people you're familiar with won't.
Nothing's stopping you from doing this now. Just tell everyone in your squad "Hey, so-and-so is my team leader. Listen to them.".

I just don't see how a separate kit/position would benefit this at all. To really work well, this would be a person you're familiar with, and knows your priorities and play style. Otherwise you'll just end up managing the squad and the team leader.

Desmos Playground is cancer. The no rushing rule is stupid and the server is always filled with kids who don't want to use teamwork.

Mr. Internet Lawyer
Ever play the sequel to a game and go back to try to first one, only to be severely disappointed? It's kinda like that. 
Poop in it and then light it on fire.
"Fuck you, pay me."

Don't forget, the 240 has 3 different fire rates. Would be awesome to be able to break it down and change it.
Stupid bot never works.

I bet the owner of a landscaping company is on the city council.
Still pretty shitty UX. It's been this way since RO2 though, so I doubt it's ever going to get fixed.

Weird, this hasn't been deleted yet.
What amazes me is when people buy a new car with paper plates, get the new plate in mail, install it and put the frame back on.
I disagree.
Use a blow dryer on it first.
Vocals are still bad.
That song is awful.
Looking at your photos, I'm 100% sure you're​ a dude.  
Racist
I wonder what it tastes like.
"Why does it say missing executable when I try to launch the game?"

"The AK single fire sound needs to be fixed."

"They should add [weapon] to the game."

That M79 was not an M79.

In BF1942 on El Alamein you could get under the hanger in the US base. You could shoot people, but they couldn't shoot back.

Gifs suck, gif replacements (mp4, webm) are great. Most gifs you see on the internet aren't actually gifs.
I mean, it's certainly a fun map and it never feels like one side is destroying the other, but at the end US always loses.

I once bought a mosin for like $69 and cut the barrel down. Thing was like a flame thrower. Very fun to shoot. Eventually I just threw it away.

This is why we can't have nice things.
You keep trying to convince the rest of the country that you have superior pizza, but no one is buying it. It's your own little local circle jerk. "Hey guys, we have the best pizza ever!!!!". Wanna know why New York pizza is only popular in New York? Because it's just a sad nasty greasy flap of cheese.
wtf this is cultural appropriation
please dont kill me
and this matters why?
Half of them were already beating it anyway.
NPCs drive extremely safe, except when your on a mission/job. Then they start running red lights, making illegal U-turns, and randomly swerving just to hit you.
I used to work with a Dan from IT. He got caught fucking the marketing manager in the server room and they both got fired.
That's why I named my dog Zeba.
Well, unnecessarily writing to log files can take up quite a bit of memory when the files get large. Just turn it on when you need it.

Idk but I'm extremely grateful I wasn't born in somolia or something.

Older guy thats been doing this for a long time and isn't addicted to meth? He could be the owner. A lot of the gas stations I go to will have the owner/family members working.
If you get blown up while doing CEO work in a session full of aggressive players, you have no one to blame but yourself. I try to find smaller session and gauge the risk by slowly delivering a vehicle to my warehouse. If no one attacks, it's usually pretty safe and I'll do some more CEO work.
