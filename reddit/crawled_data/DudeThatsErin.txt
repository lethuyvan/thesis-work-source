I mean you can use it on any carrier. You just cannot root or modify the VZW pixel phones in any way.

Other than that all pixels are the same.
Exactly.

Some best buys will activate it for you with one of our spare sim cards. We will take the sim back from you after and it can be reused on a future activation.

At least this is something my best buy does. Not sure about others.
Yes it will impede you.

One thing you have to do whilst rooting is unlocking the bootloader. That's step 1. The problem with the VZW model is that they block that from happening. They make it nearly impossible to do. There may be a guide to get around it on XDA but with every patch, it has a possibility of coming back.

You are better off buying it directly from Swappa.com (google edition) or buying the Pixel 2 XL from Google directly.

There are 0 issues with rooting the Google Editions of the Pixel devices.
Nope only with that charger
I thought the same until the red 8+. That thing looks hot.
I appreciate it. I work in customer service and I get it. I always feel bad for reps when I'm angry cause I know it is corporate and not them.

I will talk to retentions again and see if they can combine it or at least offer me a one time credit for my troubles.

Doubt the latter but can't hurt to try, right?
We (Best buy employee here) sell them unlocked BUT they lock to the first SIM card you put in them.

Meaning once you put a Metro SIM in it and set it up you have to contact Metro to unlock it if you ever leave.
Nope. I've factory reset all of my phones recently and all of them had the updates necessary
Yes
Use the fingerprint sensor?
Huh?
I did get over to retention and they gave me the $60 price.

They transferred me over to the billing team but I was too frustrated to wait on hold. I will call back tomorrow and combine them.

I have gigabit internet.

I just have how much of a fight this is too get everything to show up correctly.
Yeah my sister doesn't want to party the ~$400 ETF so we are sticking with att for longer
Hormone-based.
I started birth control when I was about 16. I started with Yaz which was good for a while. I didn't take it as you should because I was young and dumb and after about a year it made me have crying spells which would last over an hour where I would be crying about nothing.

I then switched to something else (or stopped taking it? I don't remember). Next I remember is depo. I took one shot and my face broke out with acne like crazy. I've never been that acne prone but depo made my face covered in acne no matter what I did. It was horrible. I didn't have a period though, which was nice.

Switched back to the pill to Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo. Still the best one I've had to date. Works well and doesn't cause any weird side effects.

Switched to the IUD and I was cramping and bleeding the whole time (moderately heavy period, too). I had headaches and I was constantly on ibuprofen or midol for the side effect management. I lasted 4 months (March - June) before I had it taken out. Immediately after taking it out my period became really light and my side effects were gone within 3 days. Not even exaggerating.

Switched back to Yaz and my acne started up and I didn't feel like myself.

Now I'm on an off brand of Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo and I took it for a little less than a month. My boobs ached the entire time. I was also EXTREMELY moody and cried about stupid stuff.

So, yeah, I haven't had good experiences. :/
They use the T-Mobile network.
Yeah, I'm about to talk to my sister about it when she gets home from work.

I'm so ridiculously tired of the crap. I would do auto-bill but then I'd never know what my "real" bill is.

Gosh, I should never have left Comcast. :/ Oh well. Live and Learn.
Yes
Ting is a good service if you use a small amount of data.

SimpleMobile is good, too.

Both are GSM carriers. Meaning that your phones would work on them. You would have to get them unlocked from T-Mobile which I would do before you cancel service. I've heard of people having tons of issues trying to unlock after cancelling service.
The bill due on May 8th is your last month's bill. The 17 days left reflects this month's bill.

Lucky your's posted already. Mine is due on the 15th and while I have my DTV bill my Internet one still hasn't posted to the account.
If I had to choose one.... Note8. I love the SPen.
When you have your phone connected to your car it disconnects your watch, usually.

That is weird.
It isn't your phone it is a problem with Android auto. Nothing that Samsung can help with.
Yeah idk why but Samsung messages doesn't work with Android auto for me either with both Note8 and s9+
Yeah I get that
Another widget is fantastic.
Samsung Note8 and s9+. I'm switching between those right.
I use stock, pulse and Textra over the years.

Stock changes between Samsung messages and Android messages depending on if I'm using my pixel or my Samsung phone.
You can swipe it away or at least I can with my S3 on both my Note8 and s9+. It is midly annoying to have to keep doing that but better than nothing.

Edit: word
Yeah same here. I don't understand why some people have issues with it.
Group texts work fine for me. I've been able to do it off and on. I do it sometimes for work and other times for school. 99% of people at work have iPhones.

Never been a problem for me.
Been rocking mine for a month now and while it is my work phone, I love it. 

I mostly use Samsung devices on my personal line but the pixel 2 xl is awesome.
Nope
The value of money and why it is important to think out each purchase and each credit card. Why it is bad to live above your means and what can come from it if you do.
I'm sorry I was mistaken with my knowledge. Aren't people allowed to be wrong sometimes? Geez.
You don't tell me why.
Use light flow or a similar app. Unfortunately it isn't built in to do that. It is a per app basis.
Why commenting if you can't tell me why I'm wrong? Why comment if you just want to make me feel dumb?

I realize now why thanks to another commenter.
Ah good to know
Yes as far as the lease is concerned you can call the cops for him trespassing.
Yeah that would be the only way.

Ah I'm not sure then about the calendar app.

Nope. It uses barely any battery.

Yes that is the app.

No demo unfortunately.
Nope
Nope. Works perfectly.
Hahahhaha you are funny. Samsung and updates don't exist.
Ew those are ugly.
I would try a backup and factory reset.
1) Yes.

2) not sure. I would contact the devs of those apps

3) not possible with stock app.

4) I would use month calendar widget. It looks nicer and shows everything in a unique way. Syncs better with Samsung and Outlook calendars.

5) in the notification panel you have toggles for the battery saver. You can manually toggle it whenever you want. AFAIK, the automatic battery saver is not available on Samsung devices. I see it on my Pixel 2 XL but not my Note8 or s9+

6) not possible. That's why there is the Always On Display and the Notification LED and Edge Lighting. No need, imo.

7) Use Wallpaper Changer. That's the name of the app. It is a faux-live wallpaper app that you can set to manually change the wallpaper or automatically change the wallpaper. I've been using it for YEARS and it has never let me down.

8) LastPass. Always recommend this one. Low prices and extremely secure. Available on ALL platforms too.

9) Tasker. I don't use it but I can see it's usefulness. Oh! And IFTTT. Great automation here as well
I upgraded from the note8 to the s9 but I have both and I don't think it is worth it unless you watch a lot of YouTube videos and NEED those speakers. Otherwise once you have Oreo on your S8/Note8 it is the exact same experience.
No but she can use the edge lighting to light up the edges for a few moment different colors depending on the notification.

There is also a notification LED in the top left that blinks whenever there is a need notification and also an Always On Display (aod) that shows all notifications received.
That's fine just don't call people morons and act like you do.
I don't have way of these issues on my note 8. I definitely recommend a reset. If you have a PC you can download smart switch on there and back it up and restore it.
He is trying to get away with using 2 TVs but only paying for 1 set top box.

Sorry OP it doesn't work that way. Just front the money for the second set top box and get off your high horse.
I'm in Jacksonville, FL too. I have fiber. Over in the Arlington area. 

Speeds are pretty good but too many people switched from Comcast so it goes up and down.
Yes $35 for the replacements. Once you buy one first kit, you only ever have to buy the replacements for any phone you get.
Yeah unfortunately those two phrases (cheap + good) don't go hand-in-hand with anything, specially tech.
Whitestone dome. 100%. 

No touch sensitivy issues nor any dot matrix on the screen.
I have had the note8 + s9+ + pixel 2 xl.

I'm currently selling my s9+ cause there isn't much of a difference between it and my note8. If I had to keep just one phone and sell 2 I would sell the s9+ (which I'm already doing) and my pixel 2 xl.

If I didn't have the note I'd easily sell the 2 xl for the s9+ because those speakers are better and louder than my pixel's and the features it has are amazing. I wouldn't regret the change.

Right now I'm selling my s9+ on swappa and keeping my pixel as my work phone and my note as my personal phone.
Weird mine works fine on my Note 8 and s9+
PulseSMS. I recomend them every single time this is posted (annoying to keep reading these) but they are awesome.
I have the same thing on my Pixel 2XL, Note8 and S9+.

The number of times I've had to factory reset the thing to get it to be seen is ridiculous.
I would just return and repurchase cause you would get a used device in return.
Thanks, I think?
Yes it does!
Thank you!
No cause you would be knocked out. It would be impossible.
Could be. Previous owners did have a dog. He could have had accidents all over the house. My sister already did a huge carpet cleaning so I don't know if it already is on the carpet sublayer or what.

I guess that is what we have to do. We have to learn to not feel bad. It is hard cause we wouldn't want to sleep on this bed in the kitchen...but I guess we have to learn that she doesn't care.
It isn't out of the crate though. We have 2 openings to our kitchen that lead to the rest of the house. We block one with the crate and the other with other things and keep her in the kitchen with her crate door open (she loves being pushed around in the crate, it is cute!) and her doggy bed is in the kitchen with her food and water.

In the kitchen there are 0 accidents. If we open up the kitche on the side with the crate which leads to our living room and block off the hallway and other rooms, she is having accidents (bowel movements) in the living room on the carpet. Never on the wood floor. It only ever happens on the carpet (any of her accidents).

This is why we don't understand it.
Idk it isn't her bladder though. It is her bowels but I guess that could still be the case.

Would that change with time then or are you saying that it is a lost cause and we should stop feeling bad?
We just feel bad cause our cage consists of the hardwood floor with her cage and doggy bed in the kitchen. I guess it is more about us than it is her. She doesn't seem to care. She is happy and healthy.
Try to think of it this way...

Someone bumping into you from behind that you don't find attractive (AT ALL) and then massages you and won't stop talking about or referring to sex when you are around. Then you finally get away from them for a while but then you run into them again and they don't touch you this time but just keep making lewd comments. Then you see them again a week later and they touch your arm or your side and continue making lewd comments.

Very uncomfortable.

Granted, the guy I had was like that to all genders but worse with women. He was very VERY lewd.
It really depends on what is said during the said emotional harassment/bullying.

My bullying throughout ALL of high school (yeah that was fun...) consisted of my crush on my bully... so that wasn't that personal.

Where as the sexual harassment I've had (yeah... why do people chose me???) was more physical.. massaged my shoulders, touched my side, and such. All stuff that can be very triggering for some people as that is what you do with a SO. It is very intimate.

There was also some talk in there "When are you taking me home?" "You hooked up with someone else, I see how it is." are just two of the many things but I'm just focusing on the physical part of the sexual harassment I've experienced and that affected me more than anything he ever said.

People don't think about the physical part of the sexual harassment. I guess, for me, physical harassment would also affect me but not as much as physical sexual harassment did/does. I haven't gone through physical harassment, personally, so I can't speak on that.
Yes, we have talked to the vet. It isn't frequent enough for us to consider a UTI. Our cat has had several and she would pee outside the litter box almost every time she would pee.

Our dog mostly poops inside. She can hold the pee until we wake up but not the poop.

Plus, she regularly pees outside and we never see her struggle to pee or poop. So I don't think this is a bowel/bladder problem. It is more of a training problem.
That is gross. I would at least say something about that and I'd say something like "Try to put yourself in our shoes, would you like it if I had sex with someone and he left his condom in the kitchen?" If she has any empathy at all, she will open her eyes and talk to him. Maybe even just say something to him about that but if it is feminine products then they are both doing that together.

As far as talking to her about him being there in general, did you use the tactic I described above? It works really well if you don't say "you are all in the wrong" or make it seem like that. Instead make it seem like you could be in the wrong. "This is how we feel..." "I feel this way..." "I could be wrong but from my perspective, this is what I see..." Stuff like that.

I've read about it a lot on /r/relationships and tried it on my sister and it works really well. Then again, Idk how much empathy your roommate has towards you guys.

I would also try posting this there as I don't think you are at the step for needing legal advice. Though it is always good to know your options. I would try a really good talk with her and see if anything changes first before going the lawyer/legal route.
1\) What is biohazard waste? Are you talking feces or just leftover food or literal biohazard waste?

2\) Have you tried talking to her about this? That would be my first step. You guys gather together and tell her how this is making you feel. SO can be there or not. Up to you. Don't make it all on her, don't accuse her of anything. Just say 'this is making us feel awkward that we can hear you having sex and fighting among other things.'
Yes of course. She is up to date on all of her shots. She is even on special low fat food because for a month there she would randomly start throwing up. It has stopped since we started the food and that was over a month ago.
1\) She isn't a possession you can 'make yours'. That is a horrible thing to say.

2\) Be yourself. If she doesn't like you for you, she isn't worth your time.

3\) Maybe. Just keep talking to her and play it cool.
It isn't. People are just affected by sexual harassment more because it is sex. Sex is personal and not something you generally discuss with random people just to shoot the breeze. "Normal" harassment \(I'm assuming this means physical?\) doesn't involve anything that personal. It just involves punching someone or whatever.
I just manually flashed it via XDA and it works fine. I don't notice any issues.
My company is hostwish.net
What do you mean? I'm sorry I just don't understand the question.
I removed mirena myself and it wasn't hard. I just made sure not to pull too hard and I told myself that if anything felt off I would stop immediately and go to the Dr to remove it. Luckily nothing bad happened so I was good.

Almost immediately I felt relief.

I had mine in for just under 3 months. The whole time I was bleeding and cramping and I was loaded up on ibuprofen + midol daily. I was honestly *almost* taking too much.

The bleeding faded immediately, cramps faded within hours, and the bleeding completely stopped after about 3 days where I was just spotting.

Ever since then tho I haven't been able to use my old bc and my periods aren't 'normal' for me. My normal was 1st day pain to the point that I'd puke and a very heavy period that lasted 5-7 days and came every 30-40 days. 

Since mirena my periods are lighter and not as painful but I also have skipped quite a few months of periods. This was during the 6 months I didn't use bc at all. I just started back up January, I think?

I'm not complaining about them at all. I thank God I went through the horrible pain that was mirena when I hear my sister about her similar period stories (as my old normal).

This was long but I just wanted to share my story. :)
Sit sill, look pretty by daya. It is so empowering.
What is so bad about retractable leashes?

We have one retractable and one normal and we mainly use the retractable because our fence is broken in our backyard so we have to keep our dog on a leash when outside.

She doesn't pull much but I know why she is pulling, she wants to go farther and smell that smell, whatever it may be.
I offer those services via hostwish.net just message me and let me know exactly what you need and I can get that set up.
Wireless or wired?

Is fast charging turned on in settings?
Yeah don't do that. He sounds like a low life. You deserve better. He is just using you to get what he wants.
Oh that's awesome. I wish I had a zagg near me to do that though I've gotten pretty good myself.

I was worried about the same thing with the elite so that's why I just decided to get the dome. No worries there 
Yup. I have the rhino for my note but I never use it cause I'm so worried about scratches and I have the plain black note so meh.
I have both which is why I was asking. I have no idea what I'm gonna do when the note 9 comes out but for now I'm using the s9+
Cool. I've heard horrible things about slickwraps but I can't wait to see it.

I have a spigen clear case that I love. Protects it and yet I can admire the color.

Decided to switch back to it last night as after making a pros and cons look list and I am glad I did.
Oh that's stupid. I'd rather pay $40 then that mess. My luck I'd get 10 scratches on the screen in that time.
Nope. All perfect.

Just make sure there is absolutely NO DUST on the screen. Watch videos from beginning to end before doing your first install. Don't cure it until you are 100% sure everything is perfect.

They have a warranty? I'll have to do that for s9+ cause I messed up on that. I put the speaker protector on to low and didn't know till after it cured.
It is in the sidebar but just email John at john.legere@t-mobile.com
Can't have those at work.
But when they are all you have on a phone you take what you can get.
This is true. I wish I could have a work phone. Lol I have both and I've thought about just keeping both and trading in my note8 for the note9 and possibly selling my s9+ then but idk that I can afford the note9.
Did they have Dolby atmos turned on? I doubt it.

Either way, to each their own. I do agree s9 from note8 is sidegrading but to some it may be worth it.
Nope. I'll have to check my Pixel 2 XL as people are stating that they see it on theirs /r/GooglePixel /r/Pixel2 /r/Pixel2XL

I am in my inbox right now and only the verified emails are showing up.
Nope. You can literally find your phone from the watch but there isn't a find my watch thing on it.

Doesn't do it any good to have one cause unless you spend extra money on the cellular \(most people don't\) it is useless unless connected to WiFi in which case it would be connected to your phone assuming it is a known WiFi network.
Yeah I feel the same way. Hard decision
Yeah I completely I love the speakers on my s9+.

Aren't you worried about scratching up the back of it? I have a rhinoshield for my Note8 but don't use it for that reason.

I am tempted to sell my Note8 now...but then what about a trade in for the note9 if I can afford to get it.
PulseSMS. I love texting from my desk without having to use my phone
I use the Whitestone dome. I love it. I've gotten really good at installing it after 4 installs too. It feels like I don't have a protector on and looks like it. It is worth the money.
Wait, you can disable that stupid notification via adb about the speaker? HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS? It is the only thing that annoys me about Samsung devices. It I want to go deaf, let me! Lol

I'm still deciding between my note and my s9+ though. It is hard!
Nope you are fine
It is always bad to quit without notice but no you are not. You told your manager you quit he can't expect you to come back.
Same here in note8 Latest Version set up from factory reset but happens on my s9+ and pixel 2 xl as well. All updated on Latest non-beta.
Ah
We don't have RCS yet?  I thought I did when talking to other people with Samsung phones?
Oh it needs to be more obvious.
I have the sort button but I don't see what is on that screenshot. I am setting up from scratch on a factory reset phone.
Where? 
Yes
Home screen not home button. Like in the center of the screen hard press.
Image doesn't work
1) you have to hide the icon which you can do from the home screen settings via hard pressing on the home screen then settings.

2) yes via Samsung pay settings. Open Samsung pay and go into settings and you can turn that off.

3) turn on fingerprint sensor gestures in settings. Just go into settings and search for it.
Did you touch the volume rocker?

Mime never pops up unless I do.
Love that wallpaper!
It is something that considers thought. I'm not going to do it on a whim. I have to figure out how to buy a bus pass, how long it takes to ride it to work, how to fund the bus pass, and what I wound be missing without a car.
Amazon
Klwp Is what you want.
T-Mobile doesn't cover the pixel 2xl under insurance though. I've checked several times
That's what I thought. I can't afford another loan (doubt I will get approved anyway) and I don't have any money saved up to pay it off and I'm not borrowing from my parents again.

Carmax and Chevy gave me quotes for $24k which is nowhere near what I owe.

So I'm stuck with my car, like I said. I feel like I'm going in circles here.
Because I was stupid.

How would I get around the city? I mean I could take the bus but I've never had to do that.

How would I do the private sale? It is very intimidating.
Yeah it is bad I can't believe I've been so stupid. I feel ridiculous.

I can't bank on either of those things happening. I wish but I can't.

1. I can't sell the car. I tried. I want to, don't get me wrong, but I can't. Banks will only transfer 4k max over into a new car. I doubt I can sell my car for 28k so, like I said  I'm stuck with this car.

2. My sister is paying half of Hulu and my mom is paying for Spotify (all of it).

3. I can't find it yet. I have to graduate first. I'm stuck there, too.

4. Already planning that. Selling all the extra phones I have and putting them towards credit cards.
4 months and 6% if I remember correctly. I've already looked into getting rid of it. I went to the dealership and everything. There is zilch I can do. I'm stuck with it.
Just like I told the last guy, I can't afford to get a second job. I will fail my classes if I do. It isn't an if I will fail. The classes in the summer are extremely hard which is why I am taking them last before my internship in the fall.

Not sure why you guys keep bringing up my car. I know it is expensive but I already stated I can't do anything about it.

Netflix is free so that is costing me $0. As far as the others I'll talk to my sister and my mom, maybe they will help pay for them. Sister already said she is willing to do $5.99 for Spotify but I just never started to take it.

I will talk to my sister today and see what she tells me about everything.
It goes back and forth with which one it is. Right now I'm keeping the $300 in cash and using it for eating out/snacking. Next month I'll deposit it into my account for utilities.

I can't get a second job cause I'm in school and I Will fail my classes if I do. I need to make this work with what I have.

I can't afford the $100 cancellation fee of my gym so I can't cancel it.

Okay my car is expensive... I already said I can't get rid of it so 8 don't get why you are rubbing it in.

I will start tracking everything down to the penny.
They do that? I had no idea. I'm on TMobile and I only get weather alerts via apps.
Definitely.
I'm. Not sure either but I have it in writing so push comes to shove I'm covered.
Maybe. I didn't think so.
It isn't breaking the rules. I confirmed cause I thought it was weird when the rep stated I could pay them off and keep the credits.
Not true. I checked with tforce and care and they told me that I receive the credits whether the free phones are paid off or not as long as I keep the lines. Devices don't even have to be active on those lines.
Why care if people ask why you didn't reply? Just tell them you didn't feel like it or whatever. It is none of their business why you didn't reply.
Cool. If you need hosting for your domain, let me know. I offer free and paid hosting.
Def not the cable if he has tried multiple and always has to shove them up there.
I would contact Samsung then.
Is night mode on?
Then yes the charging port is broken.
Yes
True didn't think about that. 😅
What happens when you try to scroll through your photos?
I got it too. I'm selling the paid one and keeping the free one. Using that money to pay off my pixel 2 xl. :)
It is a 27" 4K display. Really large.
-1 I can't see words far away. As in like mid-classroom the board is blurry. I cannot make out license plates without my glasses.
Yes
I didn't know there was a coloring "book" on the Note included for free. I thought you had to pay for it.

I also didn't know about the hold of the button and double tap the screen.
This is the most impressive portfolio I've seen thus far. Colors are great and you have it simple but not TOO simple. I love it!

About me needs more information. Should include how long you've been coding, any degrees or accreditations you have and anything else that is important for people to know.

I assumed your portfolio was going to include work you've done in the past. It looks like it is just a continuation of the about me section with stuff you've done in the past.

I would remove your phone number from your resume. You will otherwise start getting a lot of spam calls.
You should get a custom domain (https://namecheap.com/) for your portfolio instead of using a subdomain. It is more professional and builds trust with your visitors.

Your layout is really simple which is a good and a bad thing. It doesn't really show much about how well you can code but it makes it easy to get around.

I like how the links at the top take you scrolling down the page and that they STAY at the top no matter where on the page you are. That is useful.

It doesn't look like you have any existing work. You should make some even if it is just showing what you could do. It is just like starting off a tip jar with a dollar and a few coins. That makes people want to tip. Same thing needs to be done here.

"How I did it" what does that mean? How you did what? You need more details here. Should be "What I know" or "Skills I have" or something like that.

The contact form should have more required fields. You need a lot of information as a designer, right? Why not include, at least, half of what you need in your form? It could look something like:

Name: (sometimes people don't like to give their full name)

EMail:

Website URL/Address: (so you know where this is going, if they don't have any, tell them they can write 'none')

Website Name: (necessary for the logo)

What are you requesting I make? (so you know whether it is a logo, full website theme, template, header, etc.)

What are the 3 top colors you would like included? (gives you a base of what to start off with)

When do you need this completed by? (gives you an idea if you can fit this into your schedule)

Additional Details: (not required, but included so people can write anything additional they want you to know)

------------------------------------------

This form gives you a good base to start off with that way you don't have to waste time sending them an email after they send you one to get the basic information you need. Saves time & allows you to get started faster. Afterall, time is money.
I get a privacy error when first visiting your site. It seems your SSL Certificate is not set up correctly. Definitely look into that.

https://imgur.com/a/tsIQL => What is going on with your theme. Why is there a LOT of wasted space? This should be responsive and work on phones, tablets, TVs, etc. Otherwise, you are missing a HUGE market on your site.

Including Google Reviews is a good idea. Especially when you have so many good ones.

I think the cards in the footer are unnecessary. Also so is the contact information. It should just be listed on the "about" page. The footer should be left for your terms of service & privacy policy links as well as links to a contact form and to a google map of your location.

I do not believe you need to include your google reviews on every single page. That is just repetitive and annoying.

Your gallery doesn't work. Just shows "Unable to show Instagram photos" Definitely take a look at that.

The pictures on your blog are WAY too large. Resize them down to about 200 pixels in height. People don't like to scroll. It is annoying. What is the point of the blog anyway?

It doesn't look like you have an about page. You should include about your business so people can see how long you have been in business. This would also be a second location for the google reviews.

The google rating on every page is annoying also.

Overall the layout is simple and the colors are good. The red almost hurts my eyes but that is a minor thing.
I understand that the name of your site is 'green4webdesign' but that is A LOT of green.

Also, there is a border around your WHOLE page. That is annoying and there is no point to it. Remove it and let your theme go all the way to the edge.

The hr above logical pricing doesn't go all the way across like it does above modern design...which that one is unnecessary.

Also, the "scroll" above that is unnecessary because your header is not big enough.

The pricing and features page is just an advertisement for squarespace. Yes, you use squarespace. Yes, they are great. You don't make your prices obvious. I have to click "show solution" at the bottom of the page to even get an idea. If it is all custom work then say so at the top of the page.

All the banners on this page are annoying as well. They take up space and it is just wasted. People don't like scrolling. It isn't fun.

The page guide is useful but it should be horizontally aligned like: Key Features | Pricing & Process | FAQs

You don't need to be obvious about the 'page guide' people will get that from the links.

Great job on your portfolio. It looks good.

On the main page, the picture for your portfolio is cut off. If you can't fit it then either resize the images or don't include them here at all. Again, wasted space.

Overall interesting website and good luck on the work!

Okay I'll bring that up to her. Thanks!
So you got it from Apple? Then def not.
Ask your carrier.
nice!
Cool. Can you post a screenshot?
Okay, thank you. That's what we figured.
I guess it was: do you guys think she will end up having to pay the fines to get her Id back? Will this stay on her record?
That's definitely a bug.
Yes
Yes, very simple. Very easy.
Isn't this a "duh"????
Hm.. good question. I would probably move on but I switch phones almost every month and currently use the pixel 2 xl and the s9+ and I'm selling my note8
Understandable. Agreed that would be annoying to deal with, definitely.
Askdez on Twitter said it could take up to 3 weeks for everyone to get it
All good phones. :)
Try disabling them. I have the same issue but been too lazy to disable them.
Nova Launcher Prime 10x9 Grid

Ocea KWGT Widget

Amphetamine Icon Pack
I've decided to keep both because there are some days I wasn't battery life and other days when I don't care at all and just want features. More often than not it is the later.
Do you have dev options on?
**laughs in s9+**
I don't have any issues on either of the 2 devices I got yesterday.
I wouldn't leave Android cause of a defective device. All manufacturers are going to have some devices with defects it is inevitable.
I mean I don't have those issues so idk.
Yeah I upgrade every year so I don't worry about it. Even if I didn't though I still would.
That is incorrect. You can buy an Apple watch from the Apple store and activate it on TMobile. I've done it before.

I could get a gear S3 from Amazon and activate it on TMobile.

No difference. Still byod.
That is!
February
I don't have this issue....
Literally lol'd that is fantastic!
Pixel 2 XL in this screenshot but same setup on my Note8.

Wallpaper from Walli via 'popular' section.
No
It isn't worth it, honestly. Wait for the Note9/X
I use the note8 and the picel 2 xl and I use pulse SMS on both of them cause i love texting from my computer without needing to have my phone around.
Swappa.com us the only place I trust.
Ask on xda
If the same as next year then october
You probably don't get this feature!
Did you put the class in the HTML for both as well?
Do h1 class='head' 

And in css code it as h1.head and same with h2. That class name can be anything and then that class will be the style you want only certain headers.
True
Controlled update. It can take up to 2-3 weeks for the update to get pushed out to everyone via @askdez on Twitter.
That is so pretty! I'll have to share mine soon! I love it!
People are going to judge you in adult life, too. There is no way around it. Judging is what people do. You have to ignore it and stop caring.

Step 1. Get up and get ready.

Step 2. GO TO SCHOOL.

Step 3. Come home & do it all over again tomorrow.

Easy as that. If you don't want to be 19 OR a high school dropout GO TO SCHOOL. It isn't that hard.
This is true. :)
Not that I know of.
It is supposed to. I have a drop down of texts and Allo notifications currently. They pop up and AA reads them to me and I can respond. I don't think this works with WhatsApp but IDK I don't use it.
I have the Note8 & Pixel 2 XL right now. Both on Oreo which is the latest stable version of both.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nX3TsnT-Wjp2KWzuR7ONLqxShIwfZJGsFFoDZ38BAew/edit?usp=sharing

That is a spreadsheet I created (sorry for it being so long (width wise)) just now about the pros and cons of both.
You can turn it on in the Gear Manager app. I use PulseSMS and Textra (depending on the day) and I get all notifications on my watch.
Anyone who has an iPhone and goes to text you will not be able to send you texts. They will go to your iMessage which you don't have on Android phones.
There isn't. I finally found that out. Switched to a Bluetooth only one cause it was so annoying.
I manually loaded mine. Worked awesome and Oreo is awesome


@askdez on Twitter said it could take 2-3 weeks for everyone to get it.
Download it from the play store.

Settings > language and input > set swiftkey or gboard as default.

May just want to Google your specific phone to see how to do it. I only know for my phones.
Just use swiftkey or gboard
Awesome. Glad it wasn't until now that I needed this feature. I don't have to wait long.
I just decided to factory reset my Note to see if that would push it through and nope. :(
Good for her. I have it on my 2XL but I wanted to try it out on my Note. :/
I just decided to factory reset my Note to see if that would push it through and nope. :(
I would just contact bbb cause Samsung management does not check Reddit.
Nope. Just turned the phone on to check.
She doesn't love you, not the way you love her. You need to leave her. She is just going to keep cheating on you and once you lose trust you will never be able to get it back. It sucks but you need to kick her out or you need to leave (depending on who's name is on the lease) and move on.

It sucks that she was there for so long but she doesn't care anymore. If she did she wouldn't have done this. 
That worked, thank you!
Okay, I'll try changing my theme.
The suggested one doesn't come up. That's what I was saying.
How do I enable the policy?
Also, I can't find that registry key in my registry editor.
Mine is the opposite of that question though. I want thin borders. I have thick ones.
I don't use it so I'm not sure. Sorry.
@askdes stated it was a staged rollout. It would take up to 3 weeks for people to get them. So I'm waiting until Wednesday and shipping my Note8 out for trade-in. Hopefully, I have it by then.
If not later than that....lol
I'm using the great S3 frontier and I love it
Both. I like not having to look at the screen for notifications
Looks like a modal case to me.
Sure! I would like to do that. erinnicole.nu is my blog. It is about whatever I decide I want to write.

I'll PM you tomorrow after I take a look at your blog. :)
Nope
That is strange. I'm talking to @askdes on twitter now to see what is going on.
Yes, they did. On April Fools day.
What phone do you have? Where did you buy it?
T-Mobile Note 8 that is unlocked.
Not available there either.
I just got it now. Thanks!
Same
You can download Shazam and do a always listening but it wouldn't appear on AOD.

That's a pixel 2 only feature.
Left
Awesome
Use a different box? Other than that no
Yes? What kind of question is this?
Nice!
could be motion from your tree, a ghost, or a bug.
That's awesome!
Dang that is really good.
What about sot?
Try a different keyboard like swiftkey or gboard
Nope
I can't wait to get mine. I'm switching from the note for the battery life.
I was hoping I wasn't the only one thinking about that lol
That is TMobile that added that not apple
All AMOLED screens have it. No way around it. After a while you don't notice it.
Nice chatting with you, too.
Oh hm... Good points.

Definitely something to think about.
Thanks for the response, btw.
I don't want to trip Knox and void my warranty with Samsung or TMobile.

& I guess that is true about the bugs.

I mean Samsung pay can be used anywhere while Google pay (like apple pay) can only be used at certain registers.

Theme support I mean Samsung themes and there are tons of themes available there. So I can make the settings, notification tray, and everything else AMOLED black.

That's cool about secure folder.
You can draw on it and it syncs to Samsung cloud which is useful.
Understandable. I probably will just wait. It just makes sense.
Same.
Ugh I called and retentions couldn't get me on that plan. :/
I have a 10500mah one and while huge it is awesome.
If I keep the note8 yes.... It's looking more and more like I will.
Not as good. It can last a day but I could get the 2 XL to last 2 days if I wanted
Understandable.
Hahahahahaha took me a bit to get that but that's good! 😂
Good to know
No other unauthorized changes happened.
Cool!
The spen and snotes. Without that I'd have the 2 XL in a hearbeat
Thanks!
Hmm TForce isn't offering it to me. Can't call now as I'm visiting my parents and they would question what I'm doing and get annoyed with me. *Rolls eyes*

I'll have to call when I get home next week.
Does it annoying you to carry 2 phones around?

& Thanks!
Thay was long. Thanks!

Not much of a photo taker. As long as my photos are okay, I'm good. So the note8 camera is perfect.

Playing devil's advocate, the updated also bring bugs to the phone that they end up having to fix (maybe not) next month.

I do absolutely LOVE the battery life. It is definitely a lot better than the note.

I have bixby disabled so I don't care about that. GA all the way.

Squeeze feature is nice but didn't use it when I had the 2XL.

The speakers don't seem that much louder than my note. Yes they are a bit because of their location but not much.

Fingerprint sensor is definitely in the perfect place but I don't have issues with the one on the note...other than it not reading my finger sometimes which is just a mild annoyance.

Design is last on my mind cause of it being in a case. Screen and os matter more.

Never going to use ar stickers.

Now playing is awesome as well. Love that!

Support is awesome as well.

Playing devil's advocate again, Samsung also has Samsung pay (useful), spen, snotes, customizable AOD, built in theme support (AMOLED theme ftw), secure folder, a better screen, and a better vibration motor (imo).

I miss not being able to root my phone though. I love using greenify and naptime with root as well as gsam battery monitor and being able to edit what is on the status bar without having to use ADB.
True. Most people don't have the latter. & I have the former and things still happened on my account that I didn't authorize.
Unless you worry about the Wells Fargo + zelle + TMobile scam.
What? How did you get that?
There is a roller coaster tycoon port? What? where?
It is only for financing through a carrier.

Source: Best buy customer service employee.
Features like what?

I'm definitely curious.
Dang that's annoying.
This is true.

Definitely a difficult decision.

Idk my mom is liking my note more and more... Maybe I could give it to her and keep the 2 XL... Win win. That's what I did with her note5. Lol

I'll have to bring it up to her and see what she says... If she is interested, I may do that instead.

Still not sure if I'd want to give it up lol it is a really good phone.
How would we know? We can tell you a guess from previous releases but no one is going to know 100%.

My GUESS would be October like last year...

P.s. this could have easily been found with a simple Google search.
It is but it is useful for coloring in snotes when you are bored at work... I guess I could also play more games on my phone (lots of free time at work besides time spent actually working)... Hm...
I think it is half that and half the fact that I'm worried I won't touch my note.

I just don't want to waste that money, ya know?
Worth the money.
Hm....
Good point.... Hm....
Never. I like to root my phones... So I can't do that. Plus I'm with T-Mobile.
But if I keep the phone for years as a backup phone?
Idk I want to do it but I'm not sure if it is worth the money.
The spen a party trick? Idk
Hm.... Hard decisions.
Not the op but what about the spen?

See... I use the spen at work for notes but I don't use it at home.

I'm contemplating it for the $200 off right now. Even as a backup phone. It is always good to have one of those. Idk if that is worth $800 with taxes and shipping.

Plus I have tons of accessories for the note. :/

You don't miss the spen?

It is the biggest reason I can't seiche.
Ah that makes sense.
Ugh that's so annoying. I wish it was uninstallable on my phone.
Do you miss the sPen?

That pen is one of the big things keeping me with my Note8 and one of the reasons I keep returning the 2XL
Guarantee you it did. I have the note8 and it had fb
You upgraded from the 7edge not the s8+. This question was for people upgrading from the s8+.

OP, I wouldn't do it. Not worth the money. S8+ is just as good as S9+.
That's only with a trade in tho right?
Neither. Go for the Pixel 3 or NoteX.

Your phone is better than the 2XL and not that much worse than the 9+. 

You are only missing the speakers and Oreo... Maybe just the speakers. Not worth the upgrade.
Built in Oreo thing. Do a simple Google search. This has been asked a million times. Can't be changed lots of people hate it.
What part isn't? I didn't authorize any of this to happen.

Unauthorized changes to me = fraudulent changes.

Either way reolace 'fraud' with 'unauthotized changes' and the same question needs to be answered.
Yeah I have a note8 and I can't wait for the 9.
No, obviously not.
No I get it. I just got the 8+ today and I'm using my note on my digits line so I can use both.  Without that I like customization too much so I can't use just an iPhone
Candycons.
The Google assistant.
Alright so I will wait until after my vacation and see what happens. I'm going on vacation for 2 weeks.
Okay I'll keep checking.
Weird. Everything works fine for me on my note8
Off topic but I'm thinking about doing the same thing. What made you decide to switch?
I just use the app on my computer
You are right. I am just not used to the tracking not updating. It is such an expensive package that I really am paranoid with it.

& What is Google's fault is the type of shipping they use. Smart post is the cheapest shipping possible and I would like to guess that there isn't insurance on the package either.
This is true, yes. I just didn't think that this would happen. It has USPS on the box, I should be able to ship it out from my mailbox without these problems.
Thanks! I hope so, too.
Thank you.

It is but it is still with google as I said in my other comment.
While this is true, yes.

Google should also not be using the cheapest form of shipping possible. I highly doubt there is any kind of insurance on the package as well. For a $1200 device that I had overnighted to me, I should get a speedier shipping than "Smartpost".

That's what I have issue with. They use cheap shipping which causes issues and then when they have those issues there is nothing they can do.

I want to switch to iOS because there are apple stores everywhere so I never have to worry about shipping something back to any company for any kind of return.
Probably not without root.
Nope been up since 330 at least. That's when I got in.
Thanks
http://apps.samsung.com/gear/appDetail.as?appId=SzaZs.2017.09.24.

There you go!
Yeah I was too. I had the s4 and hated it but I love my note. It is speedy and awesome.
Correct
After your saying that even after disabling that option content is hidden still? I don't understand
No. We and customers open boxes all of the time to show what is in it.
I have to wait for a refund before I can repurchase again. :/
I have the Whitestone done on my note and I have 7 different cases ranging from Samsung official one, to OtterBox, to spigen. Never had an issue with any of them except the defender which only lifted up the protector a bit on all 4 corners.
You can disable bixby. Imo stupid reason to dismiss the phone.
Nova launcher.
Not with the extra 2gb of ram in the plus model. I have the note and it is just as fast as day 1. I've had mine for 3 or 4 months now at least.
Same.

No the bootloader has nothing to do with using it on any other carrier. It is just for rooting purposes.
Thanks!
Most likely a script mod.
It is Def a mod. Check to make sure they are all updated
Yup
No restocking fee. I asked and they told me no twice.
Yeah it sucks.. usually I can sweet talk reps but not possible here.
Yup it is too much money to let go to waste
You have to return your current pixel and repurchase to get this deal.
Yeah that’s a lot of money. I already printed everything out just have to package it up and send it off tomorrow on my break.
I don't think so.
You have to return and repurchase.
Not for the Google phones.
Not well they said the only thing they could do is a return/repurchase. So I'm just gonna return and decide then if i really want to repurchase for the discount. I have a note8 so I don't NEED the phone I just like getting those updates.
Yup
> $35 restocking fee

FTFY
Chat with them and see if you can get it. I'm chatting and they seem optimistic about getting it.
I assume so. This credit would appear faster than the trade in.
Yeah I'm excited for this. I was thinking about returning mine but since it is the same price now I'm definitely keeping it. Loving the phone so far.
Best buy's phones are unlocked.

Saying this as a Best buy mobile employee. It just has Verizon branding and removable Verizon bloatware on it but it is fully unlocked.

Edit: why am I being downvoted? This is factual information.
Same. I'm chatting to see if I can get it. I'm pretty good at these things so I hope I can.
Hahahaha Google needs to fix that
At least you know people that use it.... I've always wanted to try it but I only have 1 friend that would use it.
While $10 isn't a lot of money in itself I can understand where you are coming from with the app. $10 is a lot for an app. Definitely worth it though.
I have unlimited for having tv
This is purely the reason why I saved $20/month and downgraded. I get more than 100mbps on either gigabit OR the 100mbps plan so why would I pay $20/month more when I barely get even 1/3 of those speeds?
Pulsesms is amazing. Donated to the dev twice because I lost access to my original Google account for a bit there but it is definitely worth it. I have 2 lifetime subscriptions now.
Good to know.
They are the same people. I got it figured out at the store.
Thanks!
Thanks!
Yeah I understand but the hassle this has caused should at least get me a credit. Not my fault the store didn't know how to activate a digits watch.

I understand I may not be able to return it but I want some kind of fix for this even if it is a credit to my account.
Why is this being downvoted? I agree...
Anyone know if this works for postpaid service? Would be nice to have a 10 discount on this month's bill.
That is fast! Congrats!
Okay so basically my Gear S3 isn't showing up with a phone number and my 2 xl (in settings) is showing a different number tho calls and texts are coming through fine. So this means that I need to figure out where my gear S3 is and get it on my account, is all right?

I may just try to return it in general and get a Fitbit or something. I don't use half the features of it and the versa looks really cool. 

We will see what the store says.

Thanks for clarifying!
Looks like golden retriever to me.
Finally. Definitely getting these once released.
Are you insane?
No that's normal.
How is Samsung not stable? Isn't that the whole reason why they don't release as many updates as Google?

& Thanks for telling me and whomever else what we will and will not do like you know everything.

Thanks for assuming I'm addicted to phones.

Yes, I have gone back and forth in the past but over the last 6 months I've gotten a lot better. I believe this purchase is worth it because I'm keeping the phone for the whole 2 years otherwise this purchase isn't worth it.
True.
Yeah that was my biggest thing with the pixel vs note8. 2xl outlasted my note like crazy but I decided on the note for the spen, screen, and reliability. Plus I have a crap ton of cases for it which I didn't want to have to repurchase for the 2xl.
Don't you miss the customization of Android?
Finally
Coming from the 2xl, xl, and 6p I'm using a note8 and don't miss any of the features of those phones except maybe front facing speakers but then only sometimes.

I used to root my phone all the time and I'm loving the unrooted stuck life. More reliable and I'm not missing the updates. They just seemed to cause more issues than not.
Cool! Thanks!
Cool! Thanks!
What launcher is that?
What launcher is that?
Do you have a screen protector on it?
Yeah idk why that didn't click in my head
Okay good. That is crazy tho.
Anyone else see this? I caught it from the Sims supply but it is crazy that this was just announced. It is so different that I feel like it is fake.
That is the orientation icon
Could you have upgraded to the note8 if you wanted to?
Meh doesn't bother me that much as far as notifications go. Even the watch thing doesn't bother me cause I don't need my watch in my car.
I thought I was the only one. Good to know!
Google assistant, battery life, and just overall ease of use
I've tried both and settled on the pixel buds I love them.
Why aren't there more upvotes for this??
I was thinking of my gear S3 lte. I didn't know the sport did take one. Good to know.
Watches don't take SIM cards like that. They have eSIM so this won't work
SAME
Under color? If not there then probably not possible on that one.
True I may do that but idk I'll decide when that time comes.
Nah outside return policy oh well
Yeah, it isn't, just not worth the extra $20/month I spend for the gigabit speeds.
I didn't realize that. I am new to this stuff. Geez.
It isn't worth it. I have the Note 8 and I'm waiting for the Note 9 because the Pixel 3 XL seems like it is going to have a notch.
I'll have to look into that, thank you!
Nah we barely even use 600gb a month
Lol stupid swiftkey
Ugh that's annoying. Might as well not have them then.
S8 or note8?

I'm liking nougat on here. Android P looks like shit imo.
That's what I'm thinking too and it is making me so sad.
OMG that looks even more ridiculous than regular white. Wow.....
Yeah I have the note8 and I'm kind of glad I moved away from pure Android. This Android P is making me want to stick with the galaxies.
Darn. I thought this would be good (the system) especially with the Linksys branding. Well that makes me sad.

I guess I should downgrade to 100mbps since I can't actually get the extra speed. $20/month saved right there.
Good to know about the app.

As I said I'm using a wired connection. I have a desktop wired to one of the nodes.
I'm wired.
I shouldn't have to do that tho. The velop is more than capable of gigabit speeds.
I had that with my note8
Same thing as always.
SAME
I mean I've used Oreo... I had the 2xl for a bit and there are only a few things I'm missing that I wish my note8 had that the 2xl has. I can wait another year for them. /s 

In all seriousness though I only miss PIP and the always listening for music. The latter I realize is mostly hardware based and I won't be getting but the former is something I can wait for.
Not op but I love nougat on my note8. It is extremely stable. The monthly updates seem to cause more issues than what they are worth.
I'm sorry but that first sentence brought me back to state farm.

"Well, he's a guy so..." Lol

But I do agree that they could have and should have done better with the shade.
There is always Samsung which right now is the one I'm sticking with. I don't have any Leah on my note8 like I did on my s8+ and I have the magic of the spend which I use daily and I'll using now to swype this message together with Swiftkey.

I hate the notches sand iPhones don't offer enough customization options for me without jailbreaking.

The pixel send to be getting worse and worse as time goes on if the 3xl ends up having a notch and basically coming apple then I'm 100% sticking with Sammy until they do it to which I hope is never.
The settings panel is cool looking but I hate the clock being on the left. I understand WHY they are doing this but it would be awesome if they gave us an option for right, left, or center. I prefer my clock in the center which is where I always put it on Pixel devices.

I hope that the 3XL or 3 does NOT include a notch. That would seal the deal for me to stick with getting the Note9 or NoteX or whatever it will be called. I hope that this design change with the clock is for Android One devices that already have the notch or will be coming out with the notch.

As far as the Quick Settings icons, I like that there IS a color around the icons now but I don't think blue is that color. I really think they need to add a dark mode and just go with white and black on everything except in the settings screen where I like the different colors. It makes it easy to differentiate each setting from one another, for me at least.

Everything else seems awesome though there needs to be a way to connect 2 speakers via BT at once for the 2/2XL which already has the BT technology needed included in the device it just isn't enabled.
That website seems like a direct copy of android central. The theme is nearly identical with a few changes here and there.

Also, with all the caps in the first paragraph, it is definitely unprofessional.

Lastly, that isn't a list. That is basically "How to install Lineage OS on your Samsung Galaxy". A list would have bullet points or something like that with multiple different ROMs included. Not just one.
No magnets don't work with wireless charging
23mb max 295 for me.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. That's what I was trying to do. :)
Okay then get a new phone and get the code texted from that. If you get it from Best Buy you can return it with a $35 restocking fee.
Put your SIM card into that phone (if it will fit) and set it back up and try to get texted a code from google. I select "try another way" and that usually has an option for backup codes and to be texted a code for me.
Do you not have a backup phone? I have my phone number attached and while I still lost a google account I've had since 2011 recently from resetting my password too many times I am able to get a backup code texted to my phone number.
Yup. I do. Too bad I factory reset my phone this past month. D'OH!

So far though I haven't used as much data as I thought I did. I just added the data limit and data warning though so we will see if I do hit the warning soon.
Do you have to activate service immediately? I'm thinking about switching but I wanted to try and stay under 2GB with T-Mobile for the rest of this month but I don't want to miss this promotion.

Could I get a SIM Card -> Start Service -> Not use the service -> Then purchase the 2XL via Fi as long as I use less than 15GB/month?
Yeah, I remember that. 

I'll have to see if my phone will tell me how much data I used on what apps cause I know the T-Mobile website won't.
So, it is $80 for 15GB then $10/GB to keep the speed fast?

That is a nice change of pace.
I mean I can consume 50+GB per month depending on how many YT videos/movies I watch at work or if I decide to use WiFi at home.

What do you mean 'rest is math'? I'm really confused.
Yes
Go to a vet regardless.
That is awesome & this is an option but I have a whitestone dome screen protector on my note currently and I don't want to waste it. :(
Yeah I still have to finance tho cause it affects my coworker's numbers if I do any financing later.
Yes 100%. I know other people in the store that have it outside of mobile.
Idk I'm not mobile. I'm customer service.
Tmobile and nope. Paid off my note8
I would but I have to finance a phone because it affects my coworker's numbers if I do any financing later. Trust me that is an option but i don't want to affect their numbers down the line.
Very reliable. Only issue I have is sometimes I have to turn off my car and turn it back on for sound to come out but I think that is more my car than android auto.
 Yes and they work well
Ah
You can get a new SIM card and keep your plan. Dom cards don't mess with your plan at all.
Get a new SIM card
Had what always on?
Battery life is really long and charging is fast.
I have the pixel buds and the LG tones. I prefer the pixel buds because of the easy pairing but the LG tones are nice cause they are easy to remove and put back in your ears.
$150 Google play money and paid apps is mostly it.
Issues with setup and stuff that had to do with the carrier.
See I never contact them for that.  It is always device issues
Yeah same here. I have directv already and I am thinking about switching from TMobile with my unlocked note and gear s3. I'm just not sure if it would be worth losing the support through Twitter and Facebook + the 24/7 support over the phone.

I have fantastic service with them regardless so it is a hard decision.
Yes, it can be backed up via Samsung Cloud and via Google.
You probably have the android system drain bug that people on Nougat got. Factory reset clears it up. Nothing to clear it up without that.

Definitely weird though.
So, if Unlimited Choice is deprioritized now, does that mean if I live in an area where that doesn't happen, it would be exactly the same as Unlimited Plus just a cheaper price?

Currently thinking about switching from T-Mo. I have 1 line and 1 wearable for $92 (with insurance). I know I would lose my insurance by switching.
Yeah I love my note. I keep coming back to it. It works great.
I did. Sent it off today.
So, a rogue app you say?
Old news
As a girl the exact same age as you with a sister the exact same age as your's and with an en-suite through my room, too...I will say this.

You are being over dramatic. You go from 0 to 100 really quick. Do you not know your sister? I assume you have lived with it around get for 23 years, right? Then had she every done this before? If yes, have you talked to her about it? If yes, what came of it? If no to initial question, then what makes you assume she will now?

Why are you so insecure about yourself that you think your sister would want to do something to upset you? 

If my sister used my bathroom, I wouldn't care in the slightest. I don't care if I was home or not. We are close like that.

Even if we weren't that close, if I wasn't home and she used it I wouldn't care. It is just a toilet. Why are you so possessive over it? Why can't you share?
Holy shit. This is beautiful!
Is your Nexus tablet still fast?
Yeah I'll try that, thanks!
Yeah I know... I was trying to avoid that. I guess I will deal with it until I can reset my pw on the Google account that's on here. If I don't then I'll be locked out of my phone until I figure out that password which would be never.
Like experience shop inside a best buy? None in my area. I work at best buy.
Done and done
Yeah I have been working 8.5 hour shifts at work which started last Tuesday and it was then that I noticed that I had to charge my phone twice each shift... And even then it wouldn't be at 100% when I left. Itd be at about 70 or less.
Note 8 user here and I'm losing 2% every 10 min or so with any kind of usage. Even faster with heavy usage. It is only 3 months old. It sucks.
Ah good to know. Not as good as pixel 2 xl but still has the potential to be louder. Those things are super quiet.
On the front or where? I don't see speakers on the front... Besides the ear piece. Is it the ear piece and bottom speaker like the iPhone?

Edit: words.
What stereo speakers?
Yeah that's my main gripe, too.
This sounds like my neighborhood here in Florida. Is this by chance in Jax?
More than likely.
I mean I pasted 19 hours yesterday on a full charge and I still had plenty of time leftover...

[yesterday's charge... pic 1](https://i.imgur.com/fPTdHYR.png)

[yesterday's charge... pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/DOBXEaf.png)

I don't notice any battery drain bug... I'm not even 100% set up yet either. I am still relogging into everything.
I saw this and got excited until I realized it was SMS 2FA... That's so stupid. Like it isn't any more secure than not having it. Especially with all of these breaches recently.
Ne either... Why is a refund a bad thing when you can repurchase again?

Not sure why you are being downvoted.
Good to know. Thank you.
Yes he is a whore.

Your welcome!
Yeah idk. I love my 2XL but the N8 is nice, too. Plus, I wouldn't have to restart phone payments. XD

Being real though, I can't decide. What's keeping me with the 2XL is the rooting and what I call 'anti\-lag' as I have virtually no lag. What's keeping me with the N8 is the SPen, SPay, and Wireless Charging. It's awesome being able to just sit my phone down and know that it is charging.
See, I don't have any issues with my battery. Quite the opposite actually. Even with Feb update everything runs smooth and forever.
Yes there is. Even the Otterbox defender doesn't protect the screen much. This is specifically about the N8
Oh, I know. I have had both the JB and B&W 2XL's. The B&W one I have now is worse than my JB one was but still isn't that bad. As long as I can read the screen that doesn't bother me.
That's what I'm thinking. I just like the 2XL better when it comes to day-to-day usage.
I've never really used makeup so I don't know how it would change my life in the first place besides taking an hour or two out of my day to put makeup on which would cause me to have more acne. 
Oops sticks. I want to get it but I'm worried it will pop off
Let me know how it stivks
Probably the android os. A factory reset should clean it up.
I can try it for you. Just PM me the code.
He was saying that it isn't good to continueosly switch cases all of the time.
I have no idea how I scratched it. I think it was my dog jumping onto my bed like she does to greet me in the mornings. It is short but deep. :/

Even so, I don't want this to happen again. Esp since I removed insurance cause I thought I was going to sell this phone and now T-Mobile is telling me I can't add it back even though I wasn't told I couldn't do that. I've never had issues adding it back before.
Not bad. :)
Okay, so cases OR whitestone dome. Got it. I mean I like my otterbox defender so that is tempting... Definitely something to think about though. Thanks!
That is true.
Thanks. :\)
Oh, that is a good deal.
I mean it is better than shipping the phone back and them claiming they never got it....
PHP = Insurance, right?

& That's a good idea. Good to know, might be something I offer close friends in the future... when I get some. XD
But isn't it slower at 3mbps capped?
True
Not a good reason for long...
Man, I really wish I would have gotten the hookup while it was a thing. I really regret that!
That's awesome! Congrats! I wish I had friends I trusted to pay me for the line so I could do a family plan and save money like that. I may offer my friend it during the S9 bogo and sell the other S9 to save up money for the Note9. I currently have the Note8 and love it.
That's awesome!
Yeah, I miss the free pizza. Lol
Yeah, this is one thing that keeps me with them too. Even with Pulse SMS (lifetime member here!) Digits is just useful. I don't have to worry about installing a 3rd party app, it just works.
Cool
Really? That is ridiculous. I mean 5$ is something but I'd rather switch for 30$ or more.
How did you get a free mobile data line?
I mean it is only $25/month total.
Bluetooth is also free of charge and built in
Thanks for the heads up!
I haven't tried. I always put them back in the case before I get in the car because I'd never use them while driving.

They do automatically disconnect randomly but it is easy to reconnect.

The right earbud is extremely sensitive but compared to the airpods where I could never (literally) trigger Siri (while I had an iPhone) on them, it is a relief that these are so easy.
I love my pixel buds. They have a long battery life, music sounds great, and I love how they have the assistant built in.

I've had both for my 2 xl and I prefer the pixel buds. They are so much nicer than the airpods.
No, you are not pregnant.
That was the weirdest shit I have ever seen.
I will! Thanks!
Good for you! Congratulations!
They sound great, easy to put on, portable, battery life is great... Just overall really good. 
Exactly. 
I don't encounter this issue with them... Then again they are my main headphones. I love them.

Best place to buy one if you don't want to buy full price from your carrier.
Why didn't you just pay for expedited shipping if you knew you needed it soon?

I just ordered a panda one yesterday and it is coming today. Wasn't expecting it this fast but dang. I got panda 128gb, too.
I'm saying that this picture has been floating around for weeks now. Old news. 
It was before.... I literally don't see a difference.
That looks like the same one to me.
Yeah, I guess that is exactly how I feel. Which is why I'm still deciding but idk.
Music mostly.
Not amazon.ca but https://www.amazon.com/Armorbox-i-Blason-Protector-Protection-Reduction/dp/B01M3REZVG/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1518543546&sr=8-4&keywords=Unicorn+Beetle+Pixel+XL

That's the case for the Pixel XL.

EDIT: words.
Good to know. Thanks!
How did you do that and keep your cell phone plan? I'm thinking of doing this.
Take it back. That is not normal.
I'm going for a more classic looking watch. thanks though
None of them have it built in like the Gear S3?

That's kinda annoying.
Thanks
I'm in Florida????
Exactly
Sync ftw.

Besides that this setup is awesome.
Yeah I guess... It is just so hard to make friends. :/
Wow.... I am working full time. No need for your condescention.
Alright thank you
Darn... Okay cause I can't afford to go from 85 (paid off my note 8 + I have insurance) to 135 + cost of watch. :/

Just was trying to help out my mom and make her bill lower. Oh well.
Okay... I'd want to pay for the watch line and have my sister's line be free.... As that would save me more money.

I currently am on a single line plan.
I use 50gb easy. All day at work I browse the web and watch videos.
Is it possible to add a smartwatch and port a number from my mom's TMobile account to mine?
No cause echo...

Amazon won't ever do this cause it pushes people to purchase the echo.
It was and if 3 weren't working what makes you think vlc will work? I'm just really curious
Thanks!
Exactly.
Ah. 
S8 and s8+ do have those problems. The note 8 does not.

At least I noticed that with my s8+ which I don't regret selling.
Joke? What joke? Obv it did but now I'm curious.
See I have the note and those speed issues arent a thing with it. It feels just as fast as my pixel.
Notes on this as someone who has the 2xl and the note8 currently and is deciding on both.

Android auto is buggy on both. I had it connected to my volt and it would say it was playing music but it wouldn't play. I had to clear the data of the app to get it to work. So that can be removed from list 1.


As far as list 2-

I have no issues with lag whatsoever. I'm one that notices it fast, too. This is the first Samsung where I don't notice it/it doesn't bother me.

I still use the Google assistant on a daily basis.. I never even touch the bixby button... So that can be removed.

Software updates are slow, but there are tons of bugs when they first come out anyway so this way this keeps me/us Samsung users from getting as many of those initial bugs.

The paying extra for online storage is true but not necessarily needed as Google backs up anything necessary anyway.

Bloatware is annoying but it can be disabled with bk disabler so it is virtually not there and the 100mb of space it takes up (total) is negligible.

The fingerprint sensor is fine. I do have issues with it recognizing my fingers sometimes but then I readjust my finger and it works fine.. only an extra 2 seconds total. setting it up was horrible but once you get past that it works great.

As far as staring at the home screen without using the phone, what gives you that impression that we like to do that? Screen is better for videos but who doesn't stare at their home screen? Does that make me weird? I'm one to customize my home screen with Nova and what not and I like to stare at my work.

As far as better features, that is a matter of opinion. Personally I like the camera better on the note vs the 2xl.  I like the built in theming of the settings and notification tray. Also the bigger screen is awesome.

Imo, I'm still deciding and I like the rootablity of the pixel 2 xl but I'm leaning more towards the note because of the SPen and screen. I use that SPen all of the time.

Edit: forgot to add Samsung pay wins vs Android pay all day every day. All my cards are on Samsung pay but only 1 or 2 are on android pay.
Didn't think about it. That is an option.
Thanks! Still not sure if it is worth it though.
Yeah I noticed that.
TO THE WALLLLSSSSSS
I know you posted this a while ago but how did you get the auto Shazam to not show in the notification tray?

[auto Shazam in status bar](https://i.imgur.com/2HfG1xF.jpg)

As you can see I have 2 notifications it is running. Any idea on how to remove that second one?
Good to know
It hasn't.
Ah
Darn
Thanks
Darn
So no discount either way?
Good to know. Thanks!
Was thinking of doing that....
How so?
I'm only doing 1 line. The second phone is mine. I haven't decided between the 2 yet... I am thinking of sticking with the note 8 but they are both good phones lol
Okay and I get a 25% discount you aren't factoring in....
I live in Florida and I was thinking about doing the plus. I couldn't remember the price off hand.
Will flashing cause issues with Samsung's 1 year warranty?

I'm not new to it. My pixel is rooted so I know how I'm just worried about the warranty.

& How? I am paying $95 for autopay and a 25% discount which makes it $71.25 per month plus tax which is about $10 in my area (fl)
Kind of? Even for 1 person gaming that is really low. Op should try to convince his parents it is worth upgrading their plan.
Yeah, that's what I calculated, too. Ends up being better to stay on T-Mobile because it is a few $ cheaper (even for 1 line) each month and they have 24/7 support (for anything) and signal here is basically the same for both.

No *value* for switching. I may in the future but for now T-Mobile is a better fit. 
That is terrifying.
I mean I still have my account from when I signed up with DirecTV at the same time... It shows online. So, I'm assuming, I might still qualify. So, $300 trade in + $300 in monthly bill credits + $200 visa for DirecTV = $800 to move over.

The $10 a month would drop my bill to $108.62 for 2 lines (car + phone) which is a $26 difference.

Without that it is $118.62 with taxes and fees with both lines. For one line it is $88.62 with the $10 discount. So, only $6 more.

This is all without getting a new phone, which I may or may not do. I haven't decided. I've tried all the phones and I'm just not sure if there are any better ones besides the 2XL.
I was able to get it with the all in one script on XDA finally. I am updated now and reinstalling TWRP.
Worked! Woo! I was able to sideload afterwards. Now I'm reinstalling twrp.
Thanks!
Running that flash-all.bat didn't work. I'm still stuck at that loading screen. I'll try the all in one thing but I am afraid it will be the same case.
I did and nothing happened.
Annoying but I hope that works.
So, do what I said, go back to what was working and make it all stock and then update and then restore everything?
> Oh geeze, so did use adb to restart your phone into the bootloader?

No the phone isn't booting. So I'm using power + volume down.

I ran the flash-all.bat file from the bootloader and it isn't booting.
What do you mean update to that?

I am running that flash-all.bat and it isn't working. The last one that was woking is taimen-opm1.171019.011-factory-2df1c1cb.zip I mean I guess I could go back down flash everything back to stock (removing twrp) download and install the OTA and then flash twrp and magisk back... IF that works.
taimen-opm1.171019.018-factory-e96a86ae.zip
Yes
Yeah, i tried using GPM in the car yesterday and today and it doesn't even let you see the list of your music to select songs in Android Auto. By that I mean in Spotify on Auto you can go to "songs" and it will play from your saved songs and you can shuffle it from there. GPM doesn't have that option. I can only play from playlists... not 'all songs' or anything like that.

That's a dealbreaker for me.
It isn't working cause I can only get to fastboot/bootloader. replacing adb with fastboot doesn't even work.
I will try that but I already ran the flash-all with and without the -w and it gets the google screen with the log (not even the one with just the G) and stops loading.
It stops at Dec. 2017. It doesn't even have the Jan update. How am I supposed to upgrade the OTA with that?
I did the flash-all.bat and it still isn't loading. Is that what you are referring to?
and? I am okay with that.
all in one toolkit? What is that?

I just tried flashing with the -w to see if that would help. Doesn't seem to have. I just got back to the google screen with the lock.
Okay, since it isn't currently, can you tell me the steps? I'm okay with reflashing twrp and magisk and deleting all info but now I can't get into the system at all.
Just did that and now it is stuck at the google screen with the lock. :/
fastboot? What do you mean?

I will try that now.
I tried gpm, Spotify, and pocketcasts
Thanks!
I am not but I am speaking on knowledge. The are giving you a bill credit to keep you with the carrier. Why would they give you the credit to go with another carrier? That makes no sense.
How else do you find apps? These videos are the only way I find apps...
Love these kinds of videos. I find so many good apps.
How do you flash the Feb images? I'm gonna do that when I get home but idk how.
Yes
No they won't do that. You would lose the bill credit.
I was thinking that same thing. Lol
It takes forever for those clothes to dry though, doesn't it?
Yes
Yeah I haven't donated yet but I will when he comes back.
Full factory image
Not on androids, that is correct.
Apple Music features an all white background. White/lighter colors use more energy and which means on phones they use more battery than darker colors/black does. On a phone you want dark colors or preferrably a black color on your background as that uses no energy at all (or very little) and will make your battery last longer.
Never heard of Trinity. What made it better than ElementalX?
"What are your hours?"

"Are you open?"

"Can you google this?"

"Do you have the manufacturer's number?"

"Can I return this without a receipt if I paid cash and didn't give you my phone number?"

"Do we sell this?"

"Do you have layaway?"

"Can I talk to a manager?" (On bf or any holiday)

"Can I talk to ___ department to verify this is the correct information?"

Call one store & get told something is not in stock anywhere in the city... proceeds to call another store and gets told the same thing not realizing that this is a call center that takes all of the calls for the city.

"I was on hold for ___ minutes!"

"Your call system is so difficult to get through!"

"Can I place an order over the phone with you?"

"I didn’t purchase the geek squad protection. Can Best Buy replace my item under the manufacturer's warranty?"

"I’m a reseller and couldn’t sell these items, can I return them?"
I am having fun with it.

I never claimed to know anything about the industry.
Can't beat that excuse.
Siri sucks though... Why would you want to use it?
Ah. Okay, good to know! Thanks!
I got into the phone. I had to download 8.1.0 (OPM1.171019.011, Dec 2017)	 and flash that instead of the newer or older ones and it worked. Weird, but hey, I have the phone back!
OMG I GOT INTO THE PHONE! I downloaded 8.1.0 (OPM1.171019.011, Dec 2017) just for the heck of it since the others weren't working. Figured it wouldn't hurt anything, would just cause the same error to appear and it took longer to install, which I figured was good, AND NOW I WAS ABLE TO GET INTO THE STARTUP SCREEN! WOO!

Just so people can see what it looks like while installing the updates and what I was seeing, here are some screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/zPs6y

As you can see the bootloader versions weren't matching up. I *believe* that's why it wasn't working. I had to get a download with the same bootloader version and it worked.
Yes, I even re-downloaded it to try that.
Cool!
Yeah, I'm running into this issue with my 2XL now. It isn't [booting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7vb4x7/tried_to_root_pixel_2_xl_now_it_wont_boot_past/) :(

I wish it would be as simple as it was on the 6P. I miss that. Now it is just plain annoying and difficult and instead of taking 2 hours, you always run into issues and it takes all damn day.
Doubtful. Unless there was an update since August/September, it was still laggy before I sent it off.
Exactly.
I bet they all are. TW on tablets is still in it's older version so it is extremely laggy.
Really???? SWEET! THAT DOES MAKE ME HAPPY!
Exactly.
Not necessarily.
I had the s3 and sold it because it was super laggy and slow. I barely used it (like I do my new iPad 10.5) but when I did use it even doing simple things caused it to lag. I was using nova but factory reset it and even setting it back up there was tons of lag.
Ugh. That's stupid. I want sims to have a full life. I want depression, murdering, suicide, and everything that makes life interesting.

EDIT: Woah. That got extremely dark, very quickly. XD
Money isn't everything. I'd rather have happiness than butloads of money. I'd rather do what I love and love what I do rather than have stacks of money I don't know what to do with.

Yes, money brings *some* happiness, but you could have all the money in the world and still be depressed.
If my boyfriend alerted me while we were together that I would be poor when I wanted to become a teacher, I'd ask what was wrong with him. Why does it matter how much money I have if I am happy and doing what I love? Now, I don't want to be a teacher anymore primarily because I can't get my life together so why would I want kids looking up to me... but I could finish that degree and become one, if I wanted. Yes, I know I will be poor but someone pointing that out to me, is ridiculous.
Why do you care about money so much? Why not just do something you love instead of hating what you do (and being miserable while doing it) while pulling in butloads of money?

Money doesn't equal happiness. Maybe you are happy being an engineer and making a lot of money but there are a lot of people that don't want to be drs, engineers, CEOs etc. but still want that money. Don't you think they would rather be happy than have butloads of money? Don't you think they are happy doing what they love?
Love your flair! It is either that or "Can I get someone in electronics?"
This is true. I'll definitely have to try GPM again to see if I like it better.
Me, either.
Okay, but not now.
good for you then.
Yup, I do. I just don't use it.... I can't remember why, exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.
and?
Youtube music (for the most part) isn't the highest quality music you can get.
What does it matter? Spotify is cross platform... it works the same on both.
I guess not.
its 2018, how about you start contributing to the artists that create these songs instead of trying to make them go bankrupt and stop making music?
iOS & Android both have their perks. iOS works better for you... good for you.

You realize spotify is cross platform though, right? So, it doesn't matter whether it is on an android or iPhone. Features are the same.
Edit as in move songs up and down via a playlist without deleting and re-adding songs.
Recently tried new mods as I got a new computer and my old hard drive broke so I lost all of my saved mods and files on that hard drive. :(

I will try the other things, though!
Most people, including myself, don't own any songs. They would have to torrent which would take money away from the artists/bands/companies that create these awesome songs.
People care about green texts? Lol. That's ridiculous.
You could also just get a different music app, too... No need to change phones entirely.
Besides that, what else makes it better than spotify? I'm curious.
That is awesome!
What do you use then? I'm curious.
What makes it better than Spotify? I'm genuinely curious.
Are you used to apple music?
Yeah, to prepay for gas right at the pump would be awesome. I don't understand how that isn't a thing. It would be a change but a change for the better. It would make it easier in the long run.
Yeah, I love spotify, too! I haven't had any issues with how they are set up either.
Social features? Like what? I'm curious.

As far as only having access to your own music locally, what does that mean?
I've tried. It's been a while since I played the last time (like 3-4 months) and I still can't get back in because it seems like you do the same things.

Maybe it is because I can't stay away from in game cheats. XD
It isn't that much better. If you believe so, why?
You could have just used apple music on android?
Good to know. :) I may try it again since I pay for youtube red anyway.
it isn't a requirement. I have an account with AND without facebook.

What app do you use?
Yeah, I prefer to listen to specific artists, which is why I couldn't use it. To each their own I guess. :)
Someone needs to combine all the features of the above (except Tidal, never used that personally). I'd pay $15/month for that.
Good to know. Never saw pandora as an alternative cause it seemed just like sirius except more random with songs.
yup. that's what they are referring to. It doesn't bother me. I just shuffle my music and it is fine.
How so? I'm genuinely curious.
What makes it better than spotify? I've tried switching but the bright layout stops me. I love dark backgrounds. That and I've just use spotify for so long it is hard to switch.
Just go offline via the app settings?
yes you can? I've done it before.
Nope. I don't have the software installed on my PC. I can' listen and edit my playlists online just fine. I'd rather not have the application installed anyway.

Behind the track tells you about how the track was made and info about the artist.

Not sure about stranger things mode.
True.
Ah. Makes sense. You can upload songs to Pandora to create playlists?
I wish I could but I pay for spotify premium family and the rest of my family uses it. So, there is no point for me to use GPM even though I pay for youtube red. I try to switch over but I've used spotify for so long idk that I can.
> I can't individually remove them from curated playlists I'd rather not have them in

This would be a handy feature.
As in the premium for free via the apk?

If you are talking about the free version of pandora, you can't even add specific songs to a playlist... you create a playlist with completely random songs and ads. Bleh.
That is annoying. :/ Have you tried just playing your playlists like the daily mix or ones you created instead and starting a radio station from there?
What kind of app do you use? What makes it so bad?

I'm asking cause I'm genuinely curious.
What kind of app do you use? What makes it so bad?

I'm asking cause I'm genuinely curious.


What kind of app do you use? What makes it so bad?

I'm asking cause I'm genuinely curious.
Yeah, it is very rare. I don't listen to brand, brand new hits so it doesn't bother me but yeah, it is rare.
Why do you need to block them? Just don't listen to them and if they come on, thumbs down them. That's what I do for bieber. XD
Exactly.
Of course. Tons of people use spotify. afaik, correct me if I'm wrong, it is one of the most used music apps.
People pay for pandora premium? Last I tried to use that it was basically the same as pandora free, except you had no ads.
Spotify is great. What do you believe is better? I'm always open to alternatives?

P.S. I've tried apple music, google play music, siriusxm, and pandora and none of those are that good. Yes, AM has a slightly better selection and artists release there first (sometimes) but AM is all white and works best on iPhones while Spotify is good on all platforms. GPM doesn't have the selection and is forced on you and the only way you can use it is if you have a gmail account which I still know people that don't. Pandora you can only curate random playlists. You can't add specific songs to a specific playlist. Same with Sirius... you are only listening to satellite radio.
They are talking about moving songs up and down an edited playlist... Not sure why that matters, imo, as long as a song is in a playlist I'm happy. Who cares about the order? Do that many people not use shuffle?
Depends on when but we still best buy had it back then.
Thank God.
Cause he can.
Wow dang okay good to know though... Thanks.
Yeah that's what I was thinking.
Thanks so much! I'll keep that in mind!
Agh. I'd rather keep it then.
That's annoying. I wish I could get more than 24k for it. I'd rather keep it than lose 10k on it.
Florida. 

Will keep looking.
Thanks! Will keep this in mind.
Will do. Thanks!
That definitely helps. Thank you!
Yes it is! Thanks!
Yeah that's what I'm figuring. I can't believe I did this though I didn't think I'd be this stupid with money but I guess I am.
Thanks for this. I needed it.
Yeah I will. Thank you so much.
I am definitely going to do that. I was already planning on it. My mom wants to go with me though so coordinating that is going to be tough.

I wish I could talk to your friend to see exactly what he said.
Bite the bullet? I'm not understanding.
Ok thanks!
9 months.
We will try that.
Hahaha thank you!
Okay, I guess we could feed her twice per day... What if she doesn't eat in the morning and then we go to feed her at night and keep it out and she still doesn't eat by lets say 9pm? Just put it up and have her starve?
She is the runt and small so we leave food out 24/7. So we don't monitor it. She is 9 months old right now.

> I retired at 41 by giving up my fancy condo and expensive car and taking the bus for 7 years.

You did an edit that included this.

I wouldn't want to retire at 41. I'd be so bored laying around the house with nothing to do.
I get Netflix for free with my parent's T-Mobile account.

Smart watch, yes, I am working on convincing myself to sell it. I had it listed on swappa and took it down cause I like the thing. It is stupid.

>Now is the time to figure this out...if you live above your means, you will always be in debt. It's not a fun place to be. Stop buying things you cannot afford. Period. Make a budget. Stick to it.

I don't live above my means though. I am still saving $200 a month even with paying extra to my credit card bills. I got into this place because I was... It started with moving out while working part time (bad timing and planning on my part) and then evolved into horrible decisions with credit cards.

As far as my car, I'm not sure what even goes into selling it and I have emotional attachment to the car. I love the car. I just got the car Nov. 30th so I haven't had it long. I don't know anyone around here that would buy it anyway. I've only seen 1 Volt on the road since I got it and that was just the other day. So, I doubt there is anyone that would want to purchase it.

ETFs on TV prevent me from canceling it. Trust me, I'd be happy canceling it. My sister and I lived off just Netflix, Hulu, & Amazon Instant Video for the first year here but when my family came to visit they were bored and I felt bad. Eventually they plan to move down here but when? I have no idea.
Right... Okay. Anonymous person on the internet ran a million dollar a year business at Starbucks... Right.

Thanks for your advice anyway but not everyone can live on barebones stuff. Some people it is fine but not everyone. You can't just slap going down to barebones on everyone.
I don't understand how I can't afford it... I'm not going into debt as long as I stick to my budget. In fact, I'm still saving $200/month with the highest payments on my credit cards.

In my mind I see can't afford = going into debt with the car. NOT can't afford = still saving money every check.

Yes, I realize the car is expensive and there are tons of cars out there that are $100-200/month with the same price on car insurance BUT I can't afford to get my credit checked AGAIN for another loan or anything really. Also, I'm not sure how I'd even go about selling my car.

> You need to change your habits, otherwise why would you be asking?

Yes, I agree. I just don't see how I can't keep my car and change the rest of it. I'm just not sure how to change the rest of it or what I can do.
Thanks for your advice. I realize this is always an option but not for me. As far as the car goes, read my reply here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7un6k3/how_to_pay_down_bills/dtlm4qg/

As far as everything else, history repeating itself wouldn't work with smart devices. I'm addicted to my phone (not ashamed to admit it) so by getting rid of it I would probably explode.

Cable&Broadband - I need that for school... TV not so much but ETFs.

Beans are gross and rice would get old after a while.

Netflix is free from T-Mobile with my parent's plan.

Odd jobs, like what? Working FT and schooling PT only gives me so much free time that RN I use to relax and recharge. I'm very introverted and working around/being around people drains me and will eventually cause me unneeded stress and to become anxious and I just won't do well in school.
I can barely (mentally) handle one FT job and part time school. I don't think I'd be able to do 2 FT jobs and part time school. I know some people do that and more but for me, personally, I can't mentally handle it.
/u/hesaidwhatupdeezus said the same thing. Rather than repeating myself read the reply I gave him. :)

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7un6k3/how_to_pay_down_bills/dtlm4qg/
It is my only car. I don't have a way to get rid of it. Yes, I could sell it THEN buy a used car and it is logical to sell it but I have emotional attachment to the car.

Plus, I've bought and sold so many things this past year that my coworkers and family already mock me for it and are like "You haven't returned your car yet?" & I don't want to give them anymore ammunition for their mocking. I try to ignore them but it hurts. I've made mistakes and I realize that's why my debt has gotten so bad but it still hurts. :/

Either way, it was a stupid impulsive decision and I know that but if I sell it/get a used car, I WILL end up trading that one in for another new car. It's how I am. I can tell myself no until my face is blue but I'd just end up doing it.

Logic tells me yes, sell it and buy a used one... but my mentality and history tells me that would be even stupider than keeping it.
Only if you aren't updated to the latest o/s.
It is an accessibility feature called reachibility. It makes it easier to reach the apps on the to row.
Yeah I tried but I couldn't do it. Too closed off.

If apple watches worked on android that would be my watch. It is perfect but it isn't enough to keep me in the ecosystem and I had a mbp there for a while, too.
Not everyone uses voice/Hangouts.

Bust still, join sucks (I've tried to use it on Windows) why not link mughtytext or pulse?
Nope just double tap while screen is on... Not off, sadly.
I did the same thing except I barely lasted the return policy. XD
Who uses Allo tho? I legit know 1 person that uses it and because of that he and I used it for a day (literally) and now we don't use it.

It is a good app don't get me wrong but I don't know anyone who actually uses it on a daily basis.
Yeah it is crazy how closed minded r/android is.

I have tried both iPhone x, 8+, note8, pixel 2 xl, and while iPhones are nice in their own way I like being able to customize my phone and not be locked into having it look the same as another person with my same phone.

Otherwise, apple phones are amazing. They are reliable and you have the Apple store to fall back on if anything does go wrong.
Sell them on Swappa.com
Correct.
> Oh okay I missed where you said you already have a 2.2k emergency fund. I would maybe throw some more money in there since you have it, like $800-$1300. I'm assuming you're working, so just make sure all of your other monthly payments and expenses can be covered with your job and if not save some money for that. Then throw the rest towards that CC debt.

That sounds good, that's probably what I do. It makes the most sense.

> That's what I would do, personally. You need some money on hand to give yourself some peace of mind, but you also need to get those high interest loans out of the way with without missing other monthly payments (missed payments will always add more fees to the problem).

Exactly.
> I know you said you learned your lesson already, but I just feel the need to add that you really shouldn't put any money on a credit card that you don't already have on hand. Those fees will really get you if you keep paying the minimum. I always pay off my statement in full every month, and then you rack up a a nice chunk of change in rewards each year. If it helps, start with a debit card until you get used to spending what you can afford, then use a credit card for the rewards.

Yeah, I wish I could go back and tell myself this. :/ I was so stupid with them. I'm just trying to pay them off now so that I can get back to this.

> I'd put some aside for an emergency fund if you have absolutely none, like maybe a couple grand, and then use the rest to pay off your highest interest loan (I'm guessing CC). However, still make sure you're making the monthly payments on your other loans too.

So you would do #2? Okay, that is an option.
I don't understand. I've read this twice over...
Yeah, I'm taking them out of my wallet today. (trying to start fresh tomorrow when I go back to work)

Also, I was thinking the same thing, I may pay a little extra to the cards (except the one with no interest) over the next few months using my Emergency Fund.
You could try Paraguard. It is a tiny device that gets stuck into your uterus that is good for up to 10 years.

https://www.bedsider.org/features/70-paragard-vs-mirena-which-iud-is-best-for-you

Honestly, I would talk to your Dr regarding your options and what methods they believe are best.
Just don't have sex with her. It is that easy. If she says sex or we are done she doesn't respect you or your decisions and she isn't worth it.

No one is saying you have to have sex with her or you'll die... Just don't do it. That easy.
It has barely any sperm in precum so you don't have to worry about anything. The likely hood she is pregnant from precum is slim to none.
No
Yes I did. Thanks!
Same. Latest version of the beta on sync pro via note 8 7.1.1
Thanks for this. Will definitely help when I'm ready to buy more lights.
I am using a note 8 with the most up to date beta of sync pro and I'm on 7.1.1.
None
What icon pack?
Can I get that wallpaper?
I'm not. I havent ever nor will I ever work for Comcast...or shitcast or crapcast. I'm just stating the facts of MY situation. Don't have the player, hate the game. Aka don't hate on me, hate on crapcast.
I had mirena for 3 months and that is exactly what I had. It was the worst experience so I ended up taking it out. I haven't been sexually active in over a year so that wasn't a problem it is just for period purposes that I wanted it.

There is a good thing tho... Ever since I took it out in June 2017 my periods have been 10x lighter with 10x less cramps than before. Before it I would HAVE TO have bc otherwise I'd throw up on my first day of my period..it was a guarantee... They felt that bad. Now I can manage. I get all the same symptoms but they are much lighter.

So at least there is a bright side to going through that horrible period (pun intended) in my life.
Yup. Sure I can't do it tonight but dm me and I'll contact you Monday about it and we can see what is going on. I'm just busy this whole weekend.
Yeah it is unzipped. I tried doing exactly what you said and it isn't working.
We have 3 college students in my house and sometimes my parents and sister visits and even with them here we have a hard time going over 600tb. I have no issues with the data cap.
Well that's even worse then.
You asked for a reason. The SE has iPhone 6S parts in it. We are on the iPhone 8 now. It is 2 years later and the phone hasn't been updated.
Cause your phone sucks.
Ha!
dishonorable discharge is when you get kicked out of the military for doing something bad.

Everything you are having OP is normal.
Thanks!
Woah. Okay, well, I may do that sooner rather than later then. $17 with tax isn't bad... Thanks again for the recommendation!
I can? Oh, well, I might do that. I only have a $10 fee for those DRs. Just not sure how much the actual prescription will cost. :/
Thanks for the recommendation. If I ever in the future can afford a psychiatrist then I will let them know I want to try it.
Thanks for the recommendation. If I ever in the future can afford a psychiatrist then I will let them know I want to try it.
I tried anti-depressants before but they made me yawn til the point that my jaw hurt no matter how much sleep I got.

Plus, I can't afford to pay deductibles for psychiatrists.

EDIT: Before it was prescribed by my DR when I had tricare and meds were free as well as DR visits. I've since switched to work insurance.
I have been searching around. I've tried every different resource.cfg that I've found.

I only have MC Command Center installed in my mods folder right now under sims4/mods/mccommandcenter1.26.18

Packages would be installed under sims4/mods/packages

I have 2K+ so I figured that may be too much for my game BUT I tried removing them all and only doing 1 or 2 package files plus the shortcuts mod... None load. That's why I tried to do MC Command Center which I'm 100% sure is supposed to work but it isn't coming up in my game.

I've tried disabling mods, closing, reopening, enabling mods, closing, & reopening. Still nothing.

I guess I will try the above while also deleting EVERYTHING in my mods folder and see how that turns out but I doubt it is going to work.

I've tried looking under CAS for the CC Skins/Hairs/Clothes/etc. but they aren't showing up in there so I know they definitely aren't loading at all. 

EDIT: I've tried removing all of the folders and just storing 1 CC and MC Command Center straight in the sims4/mods folder with the resource.cfg and still it isn't working.

EDIT2: I then repaired my game and reloaded it and the resource.cfg didn't load again so I copied it back (after closing the game) and reopened and my CC didn't load still.

BTW, I completely deleted the shortcuts mod so now I'm trying with 1 package file and MCCommandCenter. I am 100% sure that MCCC is supposed to work but it isn't. I have verified that I downloaded the latest version (by redownloading it) so I know it is supposed to work (even if my other CC doesn't) but it isn't.

Yes, CC & Script mods are enabled under options>other.
It always is that simple
Go with the Note 8. I was doing the same thing and I don't regret it one bit.
Go back to best buy and talk to their mobile manager. They will know what to do. Basically they have to call their AT&T support phone number to get it removed.
Hm.... Not sure. I don't use the Gmail app personally so I can't remember all of the options when adding an account.
Have you tried using 'other'?
What do you mean link? What are you trying to do?
> the obvious alert slider everyone hates.

Why do people hate that? I loved it with my 3T. It was awesome.

Have you cleared the cache of these apps or try uninstalling/reinstalling?
Are your kitchen lights named 'kitchen light 1' & 'kitchen light 2' or some form or fashion of that?

If not, that's why it doesn't work. I say 'hey google, turn off my overhead lights' and I have them named 'overhead 1' 'overhead 2' etc. (I have 4 in my overhead fan in my room.) Same in my bathroom. Named 'bathroom 1' 'bathroom 2' etc.
I wish I could do the same I just can't stand my job anymore. Applied to move positions and they keep choosing other people instead of me when I'm more qualified than said person (I'm already ft and they are moving a pter to ft each and every time).

I don't want to be in retail for the rest of my life and can't afford NOT to have a job. 😓😧

Anyway good for you. I'm so jealous.
Ah
Does this work better than mughtytext?
Why not just use WhatsApp?
Nope. It is a google product therefore if it does happen it will.be in another 5 years at least
Just do it. There isn't a "best way". Best way is to not let it drag on any longer and rip the band-aid off.
Yes, yes it is.
Thanks for this! I'll look into it!
Mightytext, ftw!
Ugh I'm using a pixel 2 xl so I guess I just have to deal with it.
Yes and yes
Do you use it with a Samsung phone? If not when you do get remote connection do you get notifications of your texts all over again?
You obviously don't understand what went into creating iMessage. The person at xda would have to have access to all cellular carrier networks and be able to piggyback off of that to create a messaging system. That is not going to happen either.
They aren't going to do that. They do that and they are going to lose a shit ton of money. So don't expect that.... Ever.
They don't? That is so stupid. What is the point in the available credit if you can't use it on an RMA? Wow.
Yeah, I tried this, it works really well as long as you have an iMac or always on Mac.

Otherwise, it is meh.
Really? I have no problem with it in bright days
Interesting. I just picked up the buds myself and love them but never noticed this.
Thanks!
Where did you download your hair from?
Try shampoo without dyes or additives like free and clear. That has helped me a lot.
I realized how annoying and bad the note 8 was lol I want to like the Samsung devices cause the screens are amazing but I can't. I'm about to sell my note 8 now too
My settings:

- stock, unrooted

- Nova launcher with night mode

- most apps use black/dark backgrounds

- Bluetooth on and connected to pixel buds (which I love btw)

- location on high accurancy with WiFi and Bluetooth scanning on

- Bluetooth connected to either gear s3 or Moto 360

- Bluetooth connected to my car while driving (30 min max)

- brightness at 40% or less (usually less)

- mobile data and cell signal is 2 bars or more.
This is my workout playlist.

It wasn't working but finally it did.
What are we looking at?
That's what I've been doing. It is nice. I am really looking them
It has to be the same serial number. 

What kind of question is this?
Yeah I'm loving my pixel 2 xl as well. Congrats on joining the family!
Because we don't know. Only geek squad higher ups know that.
Do you have "send as sms" enabled under message settings?
You have to do this all with the geek squad. We have no idea how long they are going to have the 7 but they should stock refurbished ones for at least 2 years from original manufacturing date.
That is definitely an option
I have the gear s3 and Moto 360 v2. I love them both but prefer the size of the Moto 360 but the features of the gear s3. I have been primarily using the gear s3 but the latest update has caused the gear app on my note 8 to keep crashing so I am gonna switch to the Moto 360 for a while.
Thanks I will try this. IDK if my dad wants to do it though cause he loves his 6p. I just wanted to research so that if he chose to do it I would know how to get it done.
Why don't you contact them ans let them know?

I got mine 2 weeks ago. Sent off on the 30th
You didn't have a deductible? Darn.
It doesn't work with apple/beats products because they aren't made to have that capability.
You need to turn it off. Just Google 'how to deactivate imessage' and you will be given the Apple site link to deactivate it.
Okay. Cool.
Did you previously have an iPhone? If yes, did you deactivate iMessage?
That's annoying. :)
Okay so you had to pay the deductible too? What if something happens to your pixel 1 xl?
Did you get a lot of notifications?
Alright I think I'm going to try it out again when I get home. 😁 Thanks!
Oops I was asking if anyone has come from a note 8 to the pixel 2 or pixel 2 xl and if they missed any of the features.
I read this SOOOOO out of context... I was like what???

I thought this was real life. Lol

As far as the Sims, you should be able to edit world and move them that way. Which game I'd this?
It isn't worth saying anything. Just buy air freshener's when you get back and remove the smell.
It sounds like you rely too much on him to be happy. You need to learn to be happy on your own before you go proposing to people. He shouldn't be the one to make you happy. You should be happy because you have a life and you are living it to the best of your ability not because some guy/girl is there giving you affection and sleeping with you and rubbing your feet.

Being happy alone is one of the hardest things to learn and I'm 24 and still learning it myself. I'm getting better. I'm definitely better than I was even a year ago but I still have a ways to go. I wouldn't say 23 year olds always regret getting married but it is still a really young age to get married. One of my friends is married and 23 and has been married for at least 2 years (that I know of) and he is happy and working on buying a house. It is person to person, I guess.

But your post with all of the 'He's" just seems like you are so focused on him that you forgot about yourself. It seems like you still have low self-esteem and that is just masked by your feelings for him.

It sucks when you break up with someone but it is a good thing. That stupid saying "When one door closes, another one opens" is a true sentiment. It is hard to see it now but you will, eventually. Focus on you and your studies and work.
Except that that page doesn't work half of the time...
Same!
WOO! Just got the update as well! installing...
Use Zedge. Tons of free stuff via the app.
Agreed. I have a note 8 and if the note 8 looks like the s8+ but with a pen I definitely won't upgrade either.
She is being really unreasonable and immature. I can understand wanting a new towel because of the rats but being this passive aggressive is ridiculous.

She needs to grow up. It is just a towel... A beach towel no less. It isn't like you stole (even accidentally) something valuable. Even if it means a lot to her she needs to talk to you instead of being so weird about it.

Definitely talk to her. Tell her that you didn't know and everything you said her. If she doesn't listen just ignore her. Telling her to grow up or anything won't help. It may even make it worse.
Mine shows denied on the website but I got an approval email. Submitted mine on the 2nd of November. TForce stated it was approved and that I should get my rebate card mailed out first week of January. This will be the last time I do a rebate with T-Mobile. This is taking too damn long.
Did you turn off "mobile data limit" under "mobile data"?
I posted this here a while back. Tons of replies.

I shouldn't have to....lol
I don't see lines in that screenshot....
While it is annoying that they have had your phone for this long you are spamming them with calls and unreasonable requests. 

I understand that it was a hassle even sending them the phone but they have it now and will work on it.

You requesting next day by 5pm shipping at noon the day before is completely ridiculous. That is impossible even without UPS shipping issues.

As far as no notes I would call them back and speak to a manager and don't let them tell you they are the highest up because they don't run the company. You can always get someone higher up.
I have a 2018 Chevy Volt and it works fine. No issues.

I am able to use Samsung Pay on my Gear S3 Classic and my friend has the Frontier and he can use it there, too. This is in the USA.
Not for people in the USA. It is 325 am Eastern the morning of Christmas.
Gah I thought it would be simple. 😅 Oh well....
Oh God are the stupid questions starting up already??
No way around it without that email.
Magnets + wireless charger = 🚫🚫🚫🚫

They don't work together. It is either or.
Only way as far as I know is to factory reset the phone and redo the sync.
Gear s3 does this very well and out of the box
The App Store or iTunes Store?
Here is a link.

What? I don’t see anything....
So I have to press the cloud icon for each individual item?
Im trying but it says 0 movies
No error and yes.

It shows there are 0 movies to sync.
I wonder why this isn't told to us during our training. I had no idea and I've sold tons of VZW iPhones.
Good to know. Thanks for correcting me!
News to me. thanks!
Well, thanks for providing such detail as to what was incorrect and why I was incorrect....
Verizon's phones are globally unlocked? Have you done it yourself or just did this for customers? Cause it may not work you just may not have heard from the customer after they went overseas.
Correct.
No, just in the USA.
No you do not. You can put your AT&T SIM inside the X and you will be fine.
Cc cleaner has spam on it and drains battery as far as I recall. Files to go since it is directly from google that app won’t drain or spam with ads.
Yes, I joined /r/Apple ecosystem at the best time! :)
Yes, open a case. You did just get scammed.
Is this a jb for the Latest OS?
That's awesome!
I will have the SG 8+ tomorrow and I have 2-3 (can't remember) Spigen cases that I purchased previously. I love the manufacturer and the cases are awesome! 
Congrats! I did the same about 2 weeks ago. I am never looking back. I have a windows laptop still but it hasn't been powered on in over 30 days. I am loving my MBP 15" 256gb. Even bought a 2TB? External HD for it so that I could definitely not run out of space.

I switched my phone over to an iPhone over (will tomorrow at least) and I purchased an iPad, too. I am loving the Apple ecosystem. It is awesome.

All 3 devices are the 256gb model. I find that hilarious that all of my devices are the same storage size. XD
do you have android auto installed on your phone?
Yeah my mom pays for the best plan and has our whole family on it. It is definitely worth every penny. Once she stops paying (if ever) I will start paying for it. It is nice just having the piece of mind that if something does happen that you aren't totally out of options.
True. I might do that. 
Perfect. No issues
Textra
Wow that is an awesome read. I think I may try this for my resolution this year.
Yes
Nope. Been fine here in Jacksonville FL with Note 8 & iPhone X.
Nope. No noise from mine. Not a common thing either.
Press on the face icon underneath the keyboard?
Yeah mine stopped updating too but I got full value as well.
I'd go for the pixel. I recently got a MacBook pro, iPad and iPhone and ended up returning the iPhone and keeping the other 2 apple products.

The continuity features are great but i like Android better than iOS.
I would try a factory reset. If that doesn't work then the gear is defective.
I use keep and Trello. Personally like Trello more than keep.
I actually have been getting 90% of my albums failing to load on sync pro version 15.1 beta 8 on my note 8 running Android 7.1.1. this is while using unlimited data and wifi.

If I recall correctly same thing happened on my pixel 2 XL running same version of the app with Android 8.1
Nah I can't. It is so useful though
Didn't realize that. That's cool.
Understandable.
Thanks!
Okay. Thanks!
Ah.
That would be nice.
People still have limited texting plans nowadays? What?
Yes you can. I can turn my phone off and use my pixel 2 all day.

PS. I'm doing the same thing
Agreed. Just something we have to get used to.
Don't touch the still card in the new phone but you can still use digits while that still card isn't being used. Works for calls and texts.
Yes, the stores call about deals. I was just in a 3rd party store today and he was talking to me about how they do call outs about deals.
Nothing. Submitted on 10/30
There isn't a fast way to rebuilt credit. You just have to deal with those mistakes keep making on time payments and keep your credit card balance less than 50% of the limit.
Do you have a discord?
The same place where you clock in.
Start meal in TLC then when you come back end meal.
It really is. I'm sorry!
Ok?
While I can't give you much advice I can say we are almost in the same situation with our cat. One of our cats has issues where she pees all over the house in random spots. We are at our wits end with it. We are almost to the point of giving her up for adoption but we love her so much and she is about the same age and been with us about the same amount of time and even though she gets on our nerves we love her and I could never give her up.

In your situation, has she ever shown signs of aggression before the cancer? Has she ever hissed at your son? Usually this doesn't happen out of the blue. There is a build-up.
So you scratched it through the screen protector? That is impressive.
You are the first person to ever realize that I'm using my name in my username. Thank you for that.

& I realize not everyone is as tech savvy but it just aggravates me when people are stupid with their technology.
Isn't this obvious? Don't open attachments unless you know the sender.....
Are you sure the scratch isn't on the screen protector itself?
I figured it out. There is a setting where you can change it to mobile, home phone, fax, etc. It was set to a weird setting named "Calling Erin"... I changed that and it fixed it. Not sure how that even got created in the first place. 0.0
This is a known issue and afaik there is no fix.
I am able to do that on my iPhone. What are you trying to paste?
I have an 18 Volt and it supports Carplay and Auto and both are working 100% perfectly. I've never had either of them crash or not start up. Works seemlessly. This is on a note 8, iPhone 8+, iPhone X, and Pixel 2XL.
Idk I think it is about even.
Huh?
Apple maps sucks. I don’t understand why but it does.
2nd lockscreens only come from 3rd party or sketchy apps.
Don't smoke pot.
Nah. It needs to be fixed somehow. Not sure how but it does need to be fixed.
It is.
Yes, it is horrible!
I've used both and there isn't much difference. You just need to decide how big of a screen and phone you want. Personally I think I'm going to go back to the 8+ because I am used to having large phones and the x is too small for me.
Talk to a therapist. This is above our pay grades.
I can see how that would help.
See I get that. When I’m using a smaller phone I always feel like I’m missing something.

I finally decided to use my Note 8 because of MightyText. Not getting paid for this but I used to use this app religiously before T-Mobile’s digits came out and I forgot just how good it is. While there is no app on iPad, the web version on my iPad works just as well. I love it.
Isn't that the iPhone X?
I forgot about MightyText. I used to be a religious user of it until Digits came out. Thanks for reminding me.
Same here. :/ I just wish I could get my texts easily on my Mac. Even T-Mobile Digits is buggy still.

This is what I have so far and I can't decide.
See that's what I'm thinking, too. Ugh. Such a hard decision.
YES! Front pockets FTW. I especially hate pants with ONLY back pockets. Like I have a pair that have the cut outs/design for front pockets but none there but it has back pockets and 90% of my phones always look ridiculous in them and phones always fall out while I'm running or walking. IT IS HORRIBLE.

This is why I'm thinking small phone + tablet combination. It would make it easier for these use-cases.
Good points here. :) Definitely something to think about.
I am thinking that would be useful as well. :)
That's what I was thinking. Maybe I will do this once I pay off the phone... hm...
I guess I'm in the 1%. I hate carrying a purse and would prefer to go like a man and not have any bag except for when I need it.
Hm.. Maybe it is something I can get used to.
Is it annoying carrying around 2 phones? I'm thinking about doing that and having my note as my second phone on a limited data plan since I won't use it as much and making the iPhone X my primary line.
yes, it and the note (which is worse) are horrible to try and use one handed without a popsocket (which disables wireless charging which I use at night).
Yes, there is but you have to enable it with a swipe or triple tap. I'm referring to using it one handed out of the box.

That's what I was thinking, too. I'd carry 2 phones around and have the second phone on a limited data plan because I wouldn't use it as much. Then I'd get the best of both worlds. Is that crazy?
Sure. https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7iko4c/big_phone_vs_small_phone_which_do_you_prefer/

That's what I am thinking, too. What if I am having such issues with the Note because my hands can only handle smaller phones?
Yes, in that use case larger is MUCH better.
No duh. Like specifics. What phone is it?
Are you a male or female? Females have aggressively (yes) small pockets. So we always feel it. It SUCKS.
Maybe you have big hands then. Also, the Note 8 is bigger than the regular S8.
Agreed. Definitely something to think about.
Yeah, I don't think I could go from a 6" display to a 3.2" display. I get what you are referring to though. The X does everything a phone needs to do and it is easy to carry around and keep in my pocket.
True. What size phone would you use?
Why is that?
That's my thing, too. Why does the smaller phone bother me that much? It does all the same things that my bigger phone can. It just isn't that big and that should be that bad cause I have an iPad to use when I need something with a bigger screen.
What are those numbers? huh?
They do look amazing. I'm not hating on the bezels display and I don't understand why other people are. They have the ability to have a big phone in a small form factor.
Maybe you don't, but other people do. Are you a guy? If so, it isn't invalid for girls. For some reason so brilliant person thinks it is okay to have tiny pockets in girls jeans/pants.... If any pockets at all. Some pants only have the lines for show which is SOOOOOOOOO stupid.

Maybe it isn't the case for you but for me, the Note sticks far out of all of my pockets.
I completely agree with your definition and the reachability when I need it most (doing something quickly in the car for example) is almost impossible on the Note. I have average sized hands, too. That's why I want the iPhone X.
That's what I was thinking, too. I have an iPad with a data plan and if I have service on my phone I'll have service on my iPad so what's the point of the large screened phones?
Agreed.
Yeah, that's what I'm worried about with my Note 8. Losing control of it, dropping it and cracking the screen.
It is understandable that you would ride it out. You never know but so far my iPhone X hasn't let me down. It is also snappier than my note 8. 

Face is with lastpass is amazing. I just look at my phone and passwords get entered into fields or lastpass unlocks.

I was thinking the same thing with paying it off but idk
I mean if you compare it to the Android flagships it is a small phone. Especially when you want to watch video and that notch is in the way.
This is true but I don't keep my phones for that long.
I'm going ahead with the note 8 for a while. If I decide that I either want to use my iPad more or I want a smaller phone then I'm gonna do an upgrade on my plan to the x. Otherwise I'm happy with my note.
Very carefully.
Oh, didn't see that then. Sorry!
The problem I have doing that though is losing the Apple Watch, Continuity, and having an iPad Pro I don't use cause my phone's screen is big enough for me to not want to use it. I'm paying monthly for the data on the iPad which is why that is an issue for me.

I want to go for the Note 8, trust me. I just moved everything over from Windows + Android to Apple. I traded in my messed up HP Desktop for a MacBook Pro, got an iPad Pro and now I'm deciding on my phone and I can't decide. Both phones are really nice for their own reasons. X.X
Jesus. Who said I did a Samsung Commercial? I am just giving my opinions here. If you don't like them, that's okay. Everyone has a right to their opinions.

As far as the candy bar thing on the Note, I completely agree with you. It is very VERY tall and after using the X I'm not sure that I like that. I don't understand why it is so tall.

As far as the two tablets around, that's exactly what I was thinking. I could bring my iPad around with me wherever I go and when I need a large screen, I could use that.

Then there is Apple CarPlay though which is too limited. I just would like Waze. That's it. If I could use Waze on CarPlay there wouldn't be a debate for me between CarPlay and Android Auto but sadly since Google owns Waze that will never happen (at the very least it will take another 5 years). 
Ah. Yeah, I know. I was saying that I am deciding between a Note 8, or an iPhone X + iPad for daily use. Hence using the official names.
Agreed.
This is definitely under consideration. I've used big phones for so long that part of me thinks that I like big phones because I'm just used to phones being so big.

I handed my iPhone X to my sister and she said it was the perfect size. It was the same size as her S7 and she said she liked how the screen went edge to edge but was the same small form factor. She doesn't understand why people need the large phones and I half agree with her. If the media consumption is 90% of what I do, why can't I do that on my tablet?

If I have an iPhone & iPad, then I can also do everything else on my tablet and just use my iPhone for those small use cases where I can't bring my iPad with me.

One thing gets me though, CarPlay. I have a car that has both Android Auto and CarPlay and the Google Assistant is (and always will be) so much better than Siri. I love how the Assistant took me straight to Waze for navigation vs having to use Apple Maps. Though I just found out if I use the built-in navigation, I can see the directions where my speedometer is so I'm not sure which I like more now. XD Though I have to send directions to my car afaik... I can't just ask it. Like I said it is new so I may have just said something wrong when I was trying it out.
I'm not understanding.
Maybe it will be something I will get used to. I hope so. :)
Thanks for this. Gives me a lot to think about. :)
Understandable. Maybe it is something I can get used to.
I get that. Which is why I'm thinking about going for the small phone + tablet route so that any content consumption can be done on the tablet while everything else can be done on my phone or tablet.
Yup and that's what I'm debating against. Content Consumption vs One-Handed.
Oh, wow. I have to check that out. Sounds like it looks good. Just don't know if I'd ever go Huawei again after the 6p.
Understandable. Gives me something to think about.
Do you worry about battery life or watching YouTube videos on it?
This is so true. Definitely gives me a bit to think about.
What about one handed usability?

What if you had a tablet you wanted to use cause you are paying $20/month for the unlimited data on it.
Do you ever worry about watching YouTube videos on that small screen or battery life?
True. What if you had an iPad on unlimited data that you could carry with you for all of that stuff?
See, I do both. Most of the time both hands are free so I use both hands but after using the X, it is nice having the option of only using one hand and being able to reach everything. I had almost forgotten that was an option on phones. Lol
I guess I could understand why. It is annoying to have to pinch to zoom to fill the screen and then that pinch to zoom crops the video on the top and bottom...

So you'd want an S9 with a 16:9 aspect ratio? I could get behind that. I bet it would look cool.
Okay, then you are the perfect person to ask. I just switched over (within the last month) to all Apple devices. I was having an issue with my HP Desktop and my manager (I work at Best Buy) let me trade it in for the $2400 MacBook Pro. I also have a Cellular iPad and now I'm trying to decide between the iPhone X/8+ & Note 8. 

I had the 8+ and it was great but I wanted to try out the X so that I could see what it was like. It is too small for me but then again I have my iPad to use for the times where I absolutely NEED a big screen... It has unlimited data, too, which means I can use it as much as my phone.... or more than my phone.

I have the S3 Classic and the Apple Watch Cellular and I wholeheartedly prefer the look, feel, and function of the Cellular. The s3 Classic is WAY too big and unfortunately it is WAY to late for me to return it. :(

Anyway, why did you choose the 8+ besides the Apple Watch because that and continuity is what is keeping me with the iPhone but I've used Android for so long and still owe money on my Note 8 so that's why I keep trying to go back.
What about watching YouTube videos? Do you think you'd like a bigger screen for that? Or even battery life. Larger phone = bigger battery.
What about watching YouTube videos? Do you think you'd like a bigger screen for that?
See, that's what I'm thinking, too. It is just those 5% of times where you need it and then if you have an iPad (like me; I have the cellular one) you can do those 5% of things on it.
That would be cool. :)
Why is that? You don't feel they are unwieldy when in a pocket and you go to sit?
You are afraid of dogs that are in a game and have NO POSSIBLE WAY of hurting you because they are fake? What?
It is 549 after the monthly bill credits. Meaning to get that price you have to add it to your plan and keep it on there for 24 months.
What carrier so you have? TMobile has digits which works like that and it is free.
This is why I switched to a MacBook. Would have gotten a Chromebook if I didn't play The Sims.
Just tried out the Apple ecosystem myself and while I'm returning the phone and watch I'm keeping my iPad and MacBook. I still like what it had to offer but on a phone it is entirely too restrictive. I'm happy to be back on my note 8.
