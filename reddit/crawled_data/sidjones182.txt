too easy for them bois in Oakland, too easy
Oh yeah 100%! I would certainly like to know how/why they became to be the institution they were. Although, I feel the only way that conversation can happen is if someone wants to trawl the archives of various music forums for talk about P4K, contact musicians/music executives who benefited from P4K press in that time period, and also writers for the site and rival sites. It could be a really good conversation. 
there's a million names on this list, seems really neat. Ton of bands/artists I don't know but would love to listen to before festival time. 

didn't realize Hozier was as big as he was if he's getting billed alongside Camilla Cabello and Shawn Mendes
fuck yeeeeeessssssss

I think that's the point of this article. Pitchfork was this "boogeyman", although I wouldn't say they hated everything. Their impact on the indie scene gave them a power/influence other sites didn't have.

Anecdotally, I remember hearing the mythos of Pitchfork back in 2007, right as I was entering high school, when I still thought Green Day was the best band in the world and classic rock was definitively the best music in history lol. 

I didn't know what the AV Club was until maybe 3 years ago when I realized The Onion was their sister site.

Given P4K's content and audience, there was little to no reason a young black kid whose local radio stations were playing "Party Like a Rockstar" and Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz to know who P4K is.

Pitchfork has had its own music festival since 2005. AV Club doesn't. I think that says a lot about how big P4K was. AV Club has always seemed sort of niche to me - which is great because their writing was really good for a long time - I read AV Club more than P4K nowadays for music reviews. 
Shit this was a pretty good read. I was a kid-mid teens around Pitchfork's heyday, so when I finally got around to taking an interest in music on a deeper level, Pitchfork was losing it's cultural relevance it had in the 00s really fast. Which is good because I definitely bought into the P4K was "pretentious" and "for hipsters" meme for a while, haha.

I'm always fascinated by moments like this in time. We probably won't get back to having gatekeepers (or rather powerful voices in music critique) like Pitchfork was. The closest comparison I can think of is Fantano, but he's not a gatekeeper in the truest sense of the word.
really digging this album. I'd put it right behind The ArchAndroid in terms of execution on the production and musicality front. the sound is much more pop-driven than I was expecting, but I think Janelle does a wonderful job at maneuvering through the album blending pop with hip-hop, funk, and r&b. as soon as I saw Brian Wilson was a feature on the first track, I knew this album couldn't let me down.

oddly enough, Janelle and Kimbra, two artists whose first albums I really loved, both put out fantastic third albums this month. shoutout to april!
I'm almost certain she said many many years ago that she wasn't straight like around the time of The Electric Lady lol
yes
(Maybe) May 2nd - Turnstile & Touche Amore

May 4th - Parquet Courts

May 10th - Panda Bear

May 14th - Kimbra

(Maybe) May 17th - Margo Price

rip my hopes and dreams of seeing MBV in Atlanta
this is the greatest song in the history of music
the numbers don't lie!!
On the first leg, they're coming to Atlanta the same day as Panda Bear. Was hoping for a return but to Athens :/
Loved Vows, didn't give The Golden Echo much of a listen. Went into this having only heard "Human" and I gotta say Kimbra is fucking killing it. Every song on this album is legitimately really good. I don't hear a single skippable track. I thought the Hop Along album was AOTY... nah fam. I am fully in love with this album. 
This or Right Direction, they're both pretty damn good tracks
I had aboslutely no expectations going into this and hooooly fuck, this album is incredible. I loved Vows at the time and didn't really listen to The Golden Echo, but when I heard the snippets of what she'd been working on IG, I perked up a little bit. 

This electro pop style she's got going is incredible and her voice sounds better than ever. The instrumentals are beautiful and clean and groovy. "Recovery", "Past Love" and "Right Direction" are top tier.

ninja edit: "Version of Me" sounds like it could be a James Blake tune. goddamn.
YEEZY SEASON APPROACHING!!!!
Fuck yea. PUP has such a fun energy and they're good dudes
new TA?! Sign me the fucc up!
that's a real bummer :( MPP has a couple of my favorite tracks on it. I'd love to hear it played in full. 
I can't imagine they'll last more than a day or two. Panda Bear's show at Variety Playhouse is sold out, so I imagine this will do the same.
im patiently waiting an album. i can only listen to locket so many times ;-;
nothing more indie than owning your own label and signing yourself! 
yo how many snacks can you hold in those vest pockets?
Flew into LGA in February, somehow ended up back at the gate I got off at when trying to get to a space to get a Lyft. What a shitshow that airport is for vehicles.
lmao this is the best review of this album I've read
KAWHI DIED FOR THISSSSSSS
pretty much the every day 9-5
In "sk8r boi" by Avril Lavigne she explains "he was a boy .... he was a punk". So now, we understand that he was a punk, ok. But then later she says: "all of her friends stuck up their nose, because they had a problem with his baggy clothes".

Now correct me if I'm wrong, but punk kids didn't and don't wear baggy clothes, seems like the usual attire has been tight clothes for a long time now. Moreover, the song title presents an even bigger problem. Was he a skater boy???? Or was he a punk?? Because she does also give us the information that "she turns on TV, guess who she sees: skater boy rockin' up MTV" so we know he's been working on his musical career for a while now (the only sort of chronological timeline we get is that she says five years from now; explaining the time she witnessed his MTV appearance) but regardless, his musical talents were enough to credit him a spot in national TV.

To me, it seems that he was more of a musician rather than a skater. We actually don't get to hear any information on his skateboarding abilities. Actually, we don't even know if skateboarding was his medium, he could've been a rollerskater or even an ice skater. We just don't know. The track leaves us with many more questions rather than answers, and frankly, I'm upset. She says in the song "now I'M with the skater boy" but it's almost impossible not to assume that would be AFTER his MTV performance, so why does she refer to him as the skater boy?? How dare she not praise him for his musical success?? It makes no sense.

With all that being said, 10/10 fantastic fucking track. I would listen to it again.
it's only $7! Being put on by Emory's WMRE or whatever their radio station is called haha
what is this
04/18 - Ty Segall @ Variety Playhouse

04/21 - SOPHIE DJ set @ The Drunken Unicorn

04/24 - Baths/No Joy @ Terminal West
i actually really love this song

Late response but Ladies of Cambridge doesn't get enough freaking credit! It's easily in my top 3 VW songs, what a jam.
I remember the first time I ever heard Vampire Weekend was on MTV before a SAT prep course. The "Oxford Comma" music video came on and I was the only kid there who took an interest in it. It was quirky, had a sort of Wes Anderson vibe to it, and I loved it. 

Good times man, good times. 
I found it through an Instagram ad - never heard of her - but I got hooked by it, checked out her other stuff, and eventually bought the vinyl when it released. 

very underrated
Studies is incredible
I just recently discovered them on my Discover Weekly playlist and was impressed by their sound and how comfy it was. Didn't even realize they had a whole album coming until today!

They really honed in their sound on this album. Definitely a few standout tracks that I will be going back to.
truly don't understand how this context is lost on so many here lol

IRL I've been saying to other Falcons fans that the Falcons have needed this for years
oh jeez :( how the hell does this even happen?!
this is cool and all but i still can't change my font type in my stories and my app is updated to the most recent version and all my friends have the feature :( 
how could u do this to me
fuuuuuuuuccccccckkkkkkkkk 

kawhi didnt die for this ;-;
2 days late but thank you for this comment. It amazes me how tone deaf many of the top comments in this thread are...
yea i don't understand this feeling of being overwhelmed with too much music so readily accessible. you don't have to listen to everything that comes out on a Friday - that day or over the weekend. it's okay to take time and listen to albums for weeks - months even. 
Renata Zeiguer is really really talented :)
oh well shit that's pretty damn annoying
taobao designer now? we eatin /r/fashionreps! 
I feel like this has been the 4th or 5th time i've had low water pressure in a 8 month period of living in Dekalb County
christ dude! that's not even worth it at all. A few years ago my friends saw him on the Deep Web tour for like $45 and were by the stage. I'm happy for Donald but damn.
damn wish I was your buddy ;) haha 
I think im just gonna wait to cop the general public tickets friday so my friends and I can all stay together. They weren't able to buy the presale today :/
oh shit lmao rip Toronto
goddddd I wanna hear "Baby Boy" live so bad
I pretty much exclusively go to $15-$30 concerts - that may be due to me heavily listening to indie/underground shit a lot haha
yea seriously, I paid less than this to see Radiohead at Philips Arena in Atlanta. That's the only big artist I've ever seen and I was genuinely surprised how much cheaper tickets eere than I imagined they would be
dude I'm so sorry you gotta put up with those fucking Toronto scalpers :( 
I just went in and hit best prices and just kept clicking next and it brought me to the ticket confirmation page that showed what it would be. unfortunately I didn't cop because it's way more than I want to pay for this show
to be fair, Tyler and Vince don't have the accolades that Glover has and originally, at least in Atlanta, their show was supposed to be at a convention center
seriously, floor in ATL for the BACK was $151 after fees... 
i'm for it - don't really give a shit about his off-the-field statements. will he help us with a ring within the next few years?
Sameeee, they're so friggin' talented <3
that's part of the reason I'm not upset about no south dates. they were down here last April - first time they had played Atlanta since 2012, glad I caught em.
dig this fit!
i love the mix of high fashion with streetwear! keep it up bro, you got great style ! 🔥
can u pls stop killing the game thank u :)
no spying!!
damn even a year later the pain... its still there ;_;
 hoping for the latter! 
lol most people are very young here and don't understand economics very well
I really only listen to this album on long drives because of the album video haha
I can get down with this. I'd like to see the Falcons get back to a mobile QB if they can go that route
hey man :/
There is that sentiment A LOT among the black fans. My dad and some old co-workers felt this way for years. There was a really good article posted maybe 3 years ago that talked about this exact thing and what it means for he city and fanbase given the demographics of Atlanta.
Yet somehow fans are still calling for his head because we didn't make it past the Eagles this year... 
and Alvvays, can't forget Alvvays!
iOS 11 tried to do it but it's incredibly simple to turn off. Can't imagine it would go over well with a lot of people that they can't use their phones while driving *despite the obvious dangers*.
Yea i'm pretty bummed :(
best of luck to you man and thanks for the 6 years here! it's been fun :)
Good! I'm all for a high-powered attack offense like our team last year, but I would love to see the Falcons defense turn into a shutdown defense that can force and capitalize on turnovers and get to the QB. Falcons defense hasn't been feared since what the Gritz Blitz? I'm sure for many of us here, our parents were still children then. 

We have two pretty solid running backs, a top 10 QB, and a deep WR roster. The Falcons can be that team!
it may be shitty, but it's perfect
I love every single one of you and will be pulling for the Vikings to win it all :) bless your souls! 

Case, Stefon, and the rest of the Vikings get free drinks anytime they come to Atlanta <3
HOW LONG ARE ERECTIONS SUPPOSED TO LAST?!
FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS FUCK THE SAINTS 
WE HAVE AVOIDED HELL MINNEFUCKINGSOTA!!!!! 
this legitimately made me laugh really hard. Googling the actress and Cooper, I've got to say there's some resemblance. 
this episode came out 2 years ago... but i mean your point still stands lol
o w o
bad
am I crazy or does running the ball seem like the most obvious option in two of downs? Pretty wild season with a disappointing ending but it's been fun
im excited :)
let's make #MelodySZN a thing!
this world is cruel :(
THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE HOLY SHIT CONTROVERSYYYYYY
👀👀👀👀RUSSELL WILSON ARE U SMURFING?!👀👀👀
seriously, I saw them in October in Atlanta last year and thought "welp this is gonna be the first and last time I see them for a while :(" 

lo and behold, they're on the bills of 5 festivals I've seen lineups for. Hoping they get announced for P4K, so I can see them a third time
CHRISTIAN WTF HOLY SHIT HE'S FAST
as a Spurs fan, I would literally die reliving that run but with the Falcons
*SKIIIIEEEEUP*
wtf I love the chiefs now!
WE WASNT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE HERE!!! FALCONS STOCKED UP ON PEDIALYTE THIS OFF-SEASON!
that was such a dangerous yet perfect throw!
this turf looks like complete shit wtf 
This strategy of carrying Freeman into the end zone might actually be a genius idea. I'm gonna call Sark.
that's elite
Thanks for the tip dude, that fucking sucks :/
Shit that's lame as hell. I need to check my roku and see if I still have access to the app. 
wait when did they remove the Twitch app from Roku? That's bullshit
I truly do not believe the Falcons could go as opposed to the Eagles, Rams, Vikings. But if they went, I don't know if I'd be able to handle myself
Such an incredible album. This album is the only one this year that I have been gushing about to literally everyone I know. It's such a perfect mix of indie pop, surf punk, and dream pop. My favorite tracks are "Dreams Tonite", "Plimsoll Punks", "Not My Baby", and "Lollipop (Ode to Jim)". 

The album is the absolute perfect length too - clocking in at 32 min  - it's an album that gets  a no-skip play-through every time.

Molly's voice is incredible. The guitar work blends very well with the keys. And the production is so much cleaner while at the same time maintaining a little bit of that lo-fi edge that attracted us to Alvvays in the first place. I think Alvvays hit every mark they were going for with *Antisocialites*. The three year wait between the self-titled debut and this was well worth it. I actually haven't listened to the debut since this album came out and I own them both on vinyl.

I really cannot stop singing the praises of this album. Pure positive bliss. It's definitely my AOTY and it's not even close.
he wanted to bring a lombardi to atlanta... sadly he couldn't do it all alone :(
pretty much all for-profit systems here are predatory, it sucks :(
💞💞💞
easily. Roberts hasn't done shit all season and has cost us valuable field position every. single. time. 
fade me now mods *i dare you*
😤 JESUS DIDN'T DIE FOR THE FALCONS TO STINK IT UP DURING THE MOST FESTIVE TIME OF THE YEAR 😤
THESE REFS LMFAO fuck outta here nigga was pushed down
**Andre Roberts is bad at punt returning**
that's the most blatant DPI I have ever seen
fair enough
LOL do i kill myself now or after the game?
LETS FUCKING GO DEBOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
hey thanks! 
LOL matt ryan really has been unlucky this year with interceptions 😂
hell yea that's awesome! that'll be a pleasant Christmas :)
I just got gifted another copy of it on vinyl as a secret santa gift and ended up keeping both copies lmao it's really my favorite album of the year. it's perfect
Packers almost made the playoffs
If you haven't seen it, watch the new documentary Jim and Andy on Netflix. It kind of shows the beginning of Jim going off the rails around Man on the Moon/Truman Show era of his career.
truly one of the biggest tragedies this year is the utter disrespect this album is getting on these EOTY lists
Schrager also has the Falcons back so i fw his vision
this is dope as hell man, wasn't feeling the sunglasses before but your head fills them out well ;)
Me and my buddies in highschool some 8+ years ago would get into Xbox Live parties, launch the ESPN app and watch all the niche sports all night. Such great times.
damb deadstock?
yo what season is that dog?
holy shit I didn't even see this yesterday when I played! 
the kevin durant method
LOL St. Louis is still in there 

what a game
seriously idk what the fuck was up with that but everybody i was watching the game with were baffled at what felt like every other play your players were dying
HOLY FUCK I WAS AT WORK WATCHING THE GAME FUCKING DYING 

WHAT A WIN! FUCK THE SAINTS!!!!
bruh I'm about to drink so fucking much falcons why do you do this
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
bruh Matt Ryan .... you gotta fix your shit we might need to start looking at some sophomores and juniors **FUCK**
True true, a tipping point in favor of the NBA is definitely not in the cards any time soon. But you're definitely right abut the value of games in the NBA vs. NFL. As much as I find wrong with the NFL, I still watch most Falcons games every time they play, but only catch a few Hawks/Spurs games until playoffs.
ngl, /r/nfl's memes are ass compared to /r/nba. Even the personal team subs suck comparatively.
I don't think TV ratings wise the NBA will top the NFL for a while - considering the Super Bowl alone gets over 100million viewers every year - but I think the NBA will eclipse the NFL in terms of mass market appeal both in the states and globally due to their demographic skewing younger, their adaptation of digital media quicker than the NFL, and the fact that it's a pretty healthy international player base in the NBA so even people in Europe, China, hell even Turkey have people to root for.
shhhh we're here to talk about how good Rhodes is and how Bryant missed a crucial field goal in the 4th
i fucking hate when artists/bands do this! they'll go to florida, ala-fucking-bama, and the carolinas but not once stop in Georgia as if Atlanta isn't a top 10 metropolitan in the US and Athens doesn't have a robust music scene -_- like why
Not surprised by the top artists but a little bit surprised by [my top songs](https://imgur.com/a/zYO8f)
dilly dilly!

am falcons fan/atlanta native/resident
he fucked
they could win a championship together
gotta say, I'm surprised we're 6-4 and top 10 across the power rankings considering just a few weeks ago we looked very not good.

that being said, if we could just beat the Saints and Panthers twice, that'd make me very happy :)
hell yes, i love the second half of the song!
can't believe I've scrolled so far down and this is the first mention of how incredible "Ninety" is
I didn't even know they were considered folk lol
The Get Up Kids is almost always included as a seminal emo band less so pop-punk especially in that era considering blink-182 was the face of pop-punk in the late 90s and they both sound significantly different.
I park behind Landmark and just walk
Hell yeah I hope they really do take a lot away from this game moving forward
I honestly had us losing this game by a significant margin so I am legitimately surprised that this is the team we got for this game. They have to take this game and use it as momentum going into the 2nd half of the season.
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS TEAM?! IS THIS THE TURNING POINT?!
ADRIAN CLAYBORN IS OUT HERE EATING!!!!!
I just got back home and what the fuck?! 
fuck yah
bless
what's the top jacket?
heheee
wow these are so good, def not bad at all ^^^^^^^/s
Keuchly is a tough son of a bitch, i wonder what's cut in his mouth
wow julio what happened
tfw Matt Bosher is our toughest player 😂
lol we are so bad
poo pee ;)
99% of the time I can tell it's a bot account and either I block them or I just don't even check the account. 
It was his ACL in like 2009 
I think I saw one of his signs going down Lindbergh, "WRIGHTSON FOR MAYOR: He has some good ideas"

lol
maybe the football gods *are* with us
I listened to everything! That's my favorite of hers :)
this was on my discover weekly today and i instantly fell in love with it omg
\>:(
i like you, you've got good intuition in that brain of yours :)
why don't u show ur face cutie ;) 
damn this would happen months after OKNOTOK 😩
A friend and I saw her in Atlanta back in september and she couldn't have been any sweeter to the fans post show. She signed my copy of Soft Sounds and took a pic with everyone.
M E T A
It really is. They have fun in there. 
Same I told my friends it was like if someone else made Blonde haha
Good on Takk. I hope players and coaches are speaking up about their frustrations - be it publicly or privately. Falcons always have players who never want to speak on how they really feel shit is annoying. 
seems like a perfectly good reason to jump in and get it now haha
https://www.last.fm/user/tenkyuu404
I never heard of them prior to seeing them at Pitchfork Fest this past July. I was pretty impressed with how great they sounded. 


I bought the Radiohead OKNOTOK collector's edition for $140! Never would've thought I'd drop that much for a record
UNDEFEATED
dude! i was feeling the exact same way listening to it! I kept thinking "this has like No Reason vibes except more fleshed out and full."
this is so sweet 😭 hope they recover quickly!
brought up chuck getting lipo (lypo?) after chuck jokingly said reggie's got big ears
personally, I vote the Warriors but something tells me you wouldn't be on board ;)
they will for sure
some dweeb <3
YESSSSS! I fucking love teal jerseys! Back in the late 90s-early 00s, the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Jags had some of my favorite uniforms
👀👀👀 *nein*
I feel for you :( I became a fan in the Vick era, it's been mostly rough. the last 10 years or so have been just incredibly mediocre
are you German by chance??
I really love this album a lot. There's a lot to unpack on OOZ but I believe that was Archy's intention. I mean immediately upon my first listen I felt wrapped in the environment he created. The songs are incredibly textured yet they're all smooth. 
right cuz I'm going to miss doing other shit to watch a football team 🙄
good thing I'm gonna be at the LCD Soundsystem concert next week, i don't want to watch us get fucked by the Patriots again
LOL this defense is going to lose this game because they have no fucking discipline 
Robert Alford with a fucking crucial penalty...

**COLOR ME FUCKING SHOCKED**
Timmons
Falcons defense is gonna fuck around and let Jay Ajayi get 100+ yards and a TD smh I knew i should've started him in fantasy
TOUCHDOWN BABY!!!!
ayeeee! it was so fun!
THESE DAWGS IS HELL!
I was just listening to RE on a morning drive :/

I wonder if these allegations along with Matt's sexual abuse were the reason they had to suspend touring this year.
I was just there Wednesday and aside from the vocals (which may have had more to do with the music the bands I saw that night), I loved it. Terminal West is always my go to venue for electronic or indie shows.
banned
ur my idol
I mean sure, but like we all know nobody in the NFL *truly* cared about social issues on a large scale until Kaep started kneeling. The owners more than likely didn't give two shits, but once they started seeing the revenue drop from boycotters on both sides, they had to start paying attention.

all about that bottom dollar
was there a player committee to address social issues and injustices before the kneeling began? No. So what are you even arguing?
yea man lol
Hey Theo, long time listener, first time caller! Thanks for doing this AMA. 

How does it feel to spend money on Acronym knowing the Canadian dollar is basically monopoly money at this point?
bad bot
BEST👏🏿OWNER👏🏿IN👏🏿THE👏🏿LEAGUE

don't @ me
I missed seeing Jay Som a couple weeks ago (cuz she played the same night as Touché Amoré), but seeing JBrekkie weeks before and then finding out that they're pretty much best friends makes me happy :) 

it's my favorite indie friendship!
not Conley :((( 
As long as the Falcons took this bye week and rested and worked out some of the first quarter of the season quirks, I'm hyped af for that game! 
true true, lotta good matchups later this year for sure especially once playoff seedings start becoming a factor
that was the CRAZIEST ENDING. Hands down the best game this year - no other game will top it - not even the Falcons-Patriots rematch. Aaron Rodgers is a goddamn stud.
Aaron Rodgers I love you
the refs on their fuck shit already lol
¿por que no los dos?
;) 
more like ur-a-BUM outfitters haha
Nick Foles is so fucking trash oh my god 😂
Good bot
*Gregg Williams' ears perk up*
Haha fair enough. I just get annoyed when people talk about the future instead of the now. Sure, the Bills *could* collapse later in the season, but at the end of week 4, y'all are pretty damn good! Y'all deserve respect damnit! 
100%
rip :/
i like you :)
call him out!
No problem man! Idk what's up with some of these commenters in here saying "wait until the end of the season" about the Bills. Like we aren't talking about the end of the season, the Bills are 3-1 for a reason (read: they're a good team)
how do we not get points when we're one of the top 5 scoring offenses in the league? 🤔
The Bills game is the only one I've considered a possible loss before we rematch the Pats. If we beat the Patriots, I will be very high on us going into the more brutal part of our schedule. 
agreed, but I meant it in terms of a loss to a very good team that will bode well for us down the line. if we lost to the Bears, I would've been pissed because they're a dumpster fire. But the Bills? Aside from the fumble play, they came and balled out.
exactly. If we want to be an offensive powerhouse, we need to utilize and trust in our RBs especially considering they're the best RB duo in the league.
hamstring before the end of the half
losing to the Bills as well, this was a quality loss
truuu, the day I see the Falcons go 16-0 is the day the world ends
We fall to 3-1, Bills are 3-1, Pats are 2-2?

I guess this Sunday wasn't so bad after all :)
I forgot he was out. We definitely need this bye more than ever. Julio, Sanu, Vic, Courtney, Allen... 
Considering we're still averaging over 25+ points a game, I'd say Sark is doing well for his first year. The turnovers have been killing us, receivers gotta catch the ball. I think this bye week will be great for us.
Ah, no worries! I figured the mods were probably busy :)
we wanted them back and look what they did to us! 
> Also, our receivers have to do better catching the ball. Half of Ryan’s picks are from balls that hit the receivers’ hands. And there are more that hit the ground.

THIS 100% NEEDS TO BE THE FOCUS GOING FORWARD. Terry Bradshaw said it best last week during the halftime of the Lions game, WRs should get credit for causing interceptions. 
this team *could've* gone 16-0

but aside from that, it's definitely not a loss to be concerned about. The Bills are fucking good and we just played sloppy with and without our top 2 receiving options. We get this bye week to recoup and then come back and play against the Dolphins who look worse than the Browns.
I thought a run on the third and 1 would've been and easy conversion... yet again we're plagued by not running in game winning situations.
Ball control could be worked on a bit, but I'm not stressing over that. Rather, receivers need to stop tipping the ball and causing turnovers.
No prob, I kept scrolling through the "new" tab and everyone wanted to complain but not actually post a thread so we could talk.
Aside from that ONE call, I agree with you 100%. The team looked absolutely sloppy.

Also, fuck the Panthers but they did beat up on the Patriots so I'm slightly proud of them? haha
Ahh gotcha
Totally. I don't think this game is by any means a sign of trouble. Julio and Sanu being out didn't help our other receivers given that they were all able to be covered fairly easily without Ju or Nu as a distraction. 

We looked very sloppy and to lose to a very underrated Bills team by just 20 yards?! Tough loss, still 3-1, suck it up, and prepare for the rest of the season.
Absolutely! Get some of these kinks out early - extra rest for Julio and Sanu and Vic.
This bye will definitely benefit us. We get to see how the team plays these first 4 weeks, they get time off to rest and work on the game plan and execution. Plus, this Buffalo team is no pushover, I figured this would be a tough game. 

Coming out of the bye, we get to face the Dolphins who are absolutely terrible. The Jets are the Jets. Patriots lost to the Panthers today and have to play the Buccs next. If all goes well, Patriots will get smacked this Thursday - exposing some of their flaws. And we get to beat up on the Dolphins.
absolute trash play by the Falcons 3rd/4th/5th receiving options. Stop tipping the ball and catch the fucker. 

Aside from that bullshit fumble call, the Bills came out and smacked us in the mouth. That defense isn't a joke and Tyrod has a surprisingly good arm. That's a bright future for the Bills.

Edit: also whoever does our strength and conditioning, we need to have a talk. Some voodoo magic needs to be applied during this bye and make Ju/Nu healthy and ready to play week 6.

LOOK AT DAT BOI GO
**comedy** of errors, people are really sleep on the Bills tho so respect
that's my QB 😂😭😭
lol okay
Jones and Sanu out

we need a new S&C coach
so what you're saying is that we need to play the Colts or the Raiders??
damn this is sick theo! 
thank god someone posted this here because I was watching it a few hours ago and what the fuck is Skip isn't even talking about? Skip is literally ranting about his own personal feelings towards Pop but has nothing to do with anything Pop said.
Succ me, Matt Ryan and Julio are my first two picks every year and they are starters every week unless it's a bye week or injury. Brees is a very serviceable backup in these situations.
as much as I hate the Saints, I will never rank Drew Brees less than #2 in the division. I even draft him every year in fantasy because he's just that good
*not sure if pulling for us to win 1 or to lose 4* 

hmmmmmm
>Stafford actually lives in Atlanta!

"living", i call it reconnaissance 0____o

it's true, i know a John, I don't respect him
holy shit lol 
whaaaaaa?!
that's my QB :,)

I can't imagine how shitty not only the Lions feel but Golden Tate is probably in the worst feeling right now :( 
wow just wow
welp gg Lions
weak call it wasn't PI on either player they both went up for the ball at the same time
the brotherhood of Matts
that's why i hate that there isn't a tipped interception stat for receivers
holy shit lmao that was the loudest crowd reaction that's ever come out of my tv
whoosh 2 me ;-;
same dude
it's not really that hard. One has direct implications on millions of Americans lives and the other sucks for just fans of the Colts, which in turn helps out Jags fans. You may want Irsay to keep Pagano on board lol
lmao this is the best bot
the bow is cute, i rate this fit
$1 billion tho? who comes up with these numbers
thanks NBC, I really needed to see the drive that killed us 7 months ago -___-
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO VIC 😭
Looks like a forward pass but rodgers got blasted
Alford is always fucking costing us goddamn!
I *LOOOOOVVVVEEEEE* these penalties 😍 

cmon Atlanta, y'all are better than this
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ FALCONS TAKE MY ENERGY༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
Fuck ESPN
yea I'm not sure what the point of this article was. If it was to serve as a "gotcha" moment for this writer, it completely neglects all the failings on Hilary's part in this past election and her past history with legislation on immigration reform. 
New York's subway system is by far the worst in terms of cleanliness. I never felt more dirty than riding those trains to and from Long Island. 

Marta looks like Howie Mandel's place compared to that shit
Joe Buck is commentating the packers-seahawks game right now
Jeremy Lane ejected for throwing a punch
Defense started out nice - very fast, head hunting, Keanu Neal almost killed a man. As the game progressed, they were letting guys slip under them and Tarik Cohen was eating. 

But still, I love what I see coming from a bunch of rookies, 2nd, and 3rd year starters! 

Also, I had a feeling Austin Hooper was going to show out this season and boy was I right. He's going to be very valuable to Matt and our offense this season.
that clearly is an arm going forward
Ahh gotcha, you should be receiving a bunch of trade offers this week!
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee(d)
BROOKS REED YOU MOTHERFUCKING SAVIOR
same, I knew he was gonna be clutch because he was drafted specifically to be the future of our TE position
damn that's either really lucky or you just have serious faith haha
oh?
i know exactly who i'm picking up in fantasy this week 😁 

Tarik Cohen is so impressive. The Bears are my second team so to see this is wonderful
AUSTIN HOOOOOOOOOOOOOPER
Mike Glennon Pro Bowl Blocker??
Cohen is gonna be the new Darren Sproles, Bears fans better get hype
at least down here in Atlanta, the Green Bay - Seattle game is being shown on Fox right after the Falcons game. Usually, if Fox gets a doubleheader, there's no CDS game.
i get that penalty but at the same time i don't get it
got promoted like a month after the super bowl I believe
Jordan Howard is gonna be a stud and it looks like the dude behind him on the depth chart is going to make a nice name for himself
SACK NUMERO UNO FOR VIC!!!!
our defense too quick! i love it

i knew there was a reason i love this band! pineapple on pizza IS a delicacy
Hey Molly, thanks for doing this :) love the new album - it's incredible. Can't wait to see you guys play in Atlanta in October!

What was the decision to go for a more punk/harsher sound than the one on you guys' debut album? I think it's a really nice evolution of your sound and blends well with the traditional Alvvays sound.

Also, Lollipop (Ode to Jim) 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
Same! definitely gonna give this a listen in a bit
they've definitely topped the self-titled with this record. The faster, grittier, more upbeat sound is very pleasing. Plus the album coming in at 32 minutes it's short and sweet.

Molly's voice sounds great, the band is tighter, Alvvays is back!
The city of Atlanta thanks you !
:))))))))))))))))))) 

at the beginning of the night, i was sick

now I am well!
I will be rooting for the Chiefs this season :) bless u
sweet release
Tom Brady had enough time back there to cook a whole pot roast! 
i thought i was good but the memories came rushing back all at once like a stampede ;_;

this season gonna be rough
From [this article](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/narcos-real-dea-agents-murphy-928933/item/escobars-death-narcos-season-2-929026): 

"Pena tells THR the real Moncada was a "major force behind Los Pepes" and that they were told Don Berna was an informant working with the Search Bloc, authorized by the then-Attorney General.

"We never signed him up as a DEA informant, but he was at the base and I could always tell there was something weird," he says, adding that after Escobar's death, Don Berna went on to become a trafficker and is now in prison in the United States. "After Escobar is killed, maybe two or three years later, we find out the real truth that one of our officers at the Search Bloc was hand-in-hand with Los Pepes."

As for the Narcos storyline that shows Pena having a relationship with Don Berna, the agent says he was fine with the drama: "We never crossed that line, but that's what makes the show exciting and interesting."

Apparently, he was a part of Los Pepes. 
THAT'S WHERE I REMEMBER HIM FROM lol
Steely Dan was one of the first bands my dad got me into that made me truly appreciate excellent musicianship. They've become one of my favorite bands ever and "Kid Charlemagne" is one of the best songs ever recorded. RIP Walter, you had a hell of a ride.
I didn't know we had beavers in Atlanta haha
because Cobb County fucking sucks

source: I live in Atlanta and deal with their bullshit
\#1 is my favorite prediction :)
this dude is a fool if he thinks Caron is a top-20 player in today's game lmaoooo
was Tim Baltz the other Urbansky? those are two of my favorite characters from last year
Shoes are a bit goofy, makes you look like a clown ;)

everything else is great tho
I didn't know Tera Melos dropped something! I'm gonna have to check that out for real
LMAO what's weird about being the sole rapper on your own project? 🤔
The War on Drugs dropped as well
I just started watching GoT and I finally understand this reference! :D
Agree on Strange Mercy being one of her best. Actor and the s/t sit tied for 2nd best for me, but they're both really incredible for, like you said, being "distinctly Annie Clark". I've never heard a St. Vincent song and said to myself "this sounds like so-and-so".
simply incredible
LOL yea Teenage Emotions was so fucking wack dude. I didn't even read the review I just knew the score was wrong and there was no justification for it.
manual boys!
No worries man! P4K has been doing shit like this for years. I used to not read it growing up specifically because people said they were contrarians, bad opinions, etc. haha 

the only writer there I actively read is Ian Cohen and even then he sometimes makes me question P4K




Ah, fair enough. I can't imagine that P4K would completely disregard the writer's opinion on a score for their review, but based on what Everett said - it isn't unreasonable that they finalize a score after the original collaboration process. 
> Scores are a collaborative process between the **writer and the editor**. We typically have an idea of a **score range that the writer wants to work within** when they pitch the review. After that, **writer and editors talk about it, and we arrive at a number** that we feel makes sense for the quality of the record.

Okay so now which is: is it the writer + editor deciding the scores or a team of editors? you can't keep switching up the wording to bolster your argument dude.

There are still different writers writing different reviews and come up with different scores - which they pitch to a couple editors. The same editors don't edit the same pieces - which leads back to different people writing different reviews. idk how much more simple that could be explained. 
but that's completely unrelated to the comment you were replying to
That still doesn't mean that the same people review the same projects...
nah man that's "*new media*", traditional media doesn't give a fuck! 
the difference between this team with Smitty and Quinn is incredible
Thank you! I will certainly PM you when ready :) 
Why did you assume that $95 is a barrier for me? It's a free adoption. I could spend $95 to get a dog, but why do that when I could get the dog free and spend that $95 buying food, toys, bed, etc. and keep my initial investment a guaranteed $100 lower?  Do you not look for deals with other things? 

Just because someone doesn't buy a dog doesn't make them any less capable to raise it with the same love and care as those who did spend money. 

I grew up with dogs, so I know how to take care of them. I know a few people who picked up animals during free adoption days and they've all raised very sweet pets.
of course the one weekend I plan to go out of town, after I've been waiting for weeks for one of these adoption events, it happens smh

go get yourself a cute animal people!!
Tbh Id be down to protest Comcast
**I N N O V A T I O N**

the struggle of being a TD ;-;
this is very chill theo, dig the shorts and the hoodie!
didn't this same story with the same exact picture get passed around social media like weeks after Roof was actually in prison?
gracias!
are the pants the pl-02s from SS17?
please please please link this, that sounds incredible
lmao that's honestly one of the funniest things I read all week
same kevin
I waiting for it!
That's Lickety Splitz not the Blue Cat haha !

The Blue Cat is the bar on the lake
damn that's actually very terrible for those of us that are out of town for a minute :( I hope mine is still there when I get home 
I'm so sad I didn't know about forecastle until I was already 2 days out from flying to Chicago for p4k! I pretty much was dead at the end of LCD from the sheer intensity of the crowd and the music
I won't hold my breath lol
right?! I feel like a crazy person seeing this. That was like the first world they confirmed.
I already pre-ordered it when Amazon randomly had it discounted to $40 three years ago lol
LCD and ATCQ fucking wrecked my shit! First time seeing both of them live - RIP Phife, your brothers did you respect. 

Mitski was so beautiful - I love her so much. So sweet. Cherry Glazerr blew me away. First day was incredible - Frankie Cosmos, Vince, Danny Brown, Dirty Projectors - just wonderful. 
same bro except i don't live in the Bay... haven't decided if i'm happy or sad about that part tbh
henlo jdot!
he probably bought this phone JUST FOR THIS MOMENT! 🤔
me gustaaaaa
they were discontinued before it even began.
that bandwagon was getting pretty crowded at the time LeBron was there. Huge spike on social media interaction and membership - Facebook was still in it's prime, Twitter was gaining much attention really really fast, The Decision happened and LeBron became the most controversial celebrity in the US for his entire Heat tenure. 

Looking back at it, that was truly a great time to be alive haha
this is fucking hilarious
cannot fucking wait!
this is a good fix
I will never find this scene not funny, it gets me every time haha
im %110 for it
thanks
i might have to bite on this - take that hit on rent for owning a pet
this coming season Chargers vs. Falcons - co-champions making NFL history I want to see my man Philip Rivers get that ring he deserves! :)
I've been following Iggy since his Sixer days. If he comes to the Hawks, I'd be pretty happy. However, at 20 mil, that's a lot for a vet coming off the bench.
damn too real bro, too real
I can't remember her name but I want to check out more of her stuff. She had some good jokes yesterday
agreed
i usually never look further than what comes up on my timeline. that and the memes. twitter's methods of presenting their platform are very convoluted
who is our /u/whodatmiami  lmaooo
Hell yeah, he's about come out swinging his sophomore year.
I love it! Dude has the energy and leadership to mesh well while still coaching these young studs we have on defense. 
I always assumed the Warriors were San Francisco until I realized like 4 years ago that they played in Oakland. Either way, considering how many really popular cities are included in the Bay Area - at least that I can think of, it's a fairly large market.
I've been listening to Melodrama, Beautiful Thugger Girls, and Pretty Girls Like Trap Music. 

Currently on Crack-Up and I gotta say, today has been the most wonderful day. 
This is amazing lmao /u/RDollaz enjoy it bro!
yea this is highly discomforting
When did Warren Sapp get a reddit account?
What can the Hawks do in this draft/off-season to get a bonafide killer on the court? 

As an Atlanta native and fan of all Atlanta sports teams, a theme I've noticed across the last decade and a half or so is that Atlanta teams don't have **THAT** stud - the guy who can ball out day in and day out make people fear facing them. 

Julio Jones is obviously the exception to this - but for basketball, they need a guy with that raw talent, a lights out shooter. I'm not sure what their cap space is looking like this season or for the future, but who are potential targets in draft/FA/or trade that could work on the Hawks
I like this idea - *in theory* 
Respect to GSW! 
smh I bet he has a Salt Life sticker on his car
in 6
clearly
that bait so good /r/nba eating it up
Jr Smith bless your heart
as a falcons fan, im not over it ;_;
I know! when he came back the next year in that motherfuckinnnn red suit and performed Runaway 😩😩😩😩😩😩
yea man it's wild that was before fucking MBDTF
and because they are mostly white women who are still butthurt about Ye interrupting innocent ol' Taylor Swift at the VMAs almost 10 years ago but hey what can you do
nah we don't do that, the jerk only works one way!
thank you for this! I felt like a crazy person visiting r/Pokémon and watching certain YouTubers praise the hell out of this game, meanwhile i'm trudging through the first 4 island trials completely bored out of my mind. I was more excited about the Gold and Silver VC releases than Ultra Sun and Moon. Sun and Moon are easily the worst Pokémon games I've ever played which sucks because Pokémon is one of the few gaming franchises I have played since it's inception and have owned nearly every game at one point in time. 
the people defending this trash ass pokémon direct can't function without a new Pokémon game every year so they're content with being fed garbage titles because they're children. Pokémon has gone the Call of Duty route at this point. Let's hope E3 they announce shit worth givin attention.
uggggghhhhhh fuck yes i need this!
That too. I think the quality of the 3DS games is significantly less than its predecessors. 
oh shit, you're right I forgot it takes place 2 years later
No, it's in the same region, but the story is from a different perspective - that's exactly like B2/W2. 
don't say that too loud, you'll get downvoted for going against the crowd
I won't trust me, but as a Pokémon fan since the beginning, I can complain about whatever I want especially when they're re-skinning a year old game to sell you for the same price as the old one while it also is still the same price is fucked up. 
After SM lost my interest after about a few weeks, I concluded that Pokémon won't be as great as it could be until it moves off of handheld. 

Combine the mechanics of the handheld games with Pokémon Stadium-like battle system and you've got an instant seller. 
what if I told you I didn't want a third game?? 🤔🤔🤔
Yea it was hand holding you throughout the game. There's no challenging aspect to this shit anymore. I couldn't even find it in myself to want to play online in SM 😒
lol Pokémon is one of the worlds largest merchandising brand pulling in upwards of $50bn across its entire lifespan. So I'm gonna say no, Pokémon is not becoming a cash grab.

although, I share your disappointment with this announcement
I didn't even get past the 4th trial thing... I don't see how people are hyped for this, it's the same game just from a different perspective...
LMAO they could've announced all this shit at E3
right lol for $7 there's more than enough tv shows and movies to watch besides the shit reddit like to circle jerk over as being the only good shows on netflix
because as it turns out it wasn't alcohol but a bad reaction to prescription medication... why is that so hard to understand? People take medication all the time and some have negative reactions to them *after* the initial point of ingestion. He wasn't knowingly behind the wheel after being fucked up by the meds, it happened as he was driving. 
it's the greatest theme in the history of sports
w2c party hat?
You are clearly operating on a level of reading comprehension that is well below the required level for reddit. Vick's influence on modern scrambling QBs is majority solely a direct response to his level of play. Cam and Wilson were fucking babies when Steve Young played his last game - they sure as hell weren't watching him growing up, they were watching Vick. Cam was a Falcons fan for fuck's sake when Vick was here. Randall Cunningham and Fran Tarkenton played and retired decades before either Cam or Wilson was born. 

Any commentator, any analyst, any football fan with half a brain can look at Michael Vick's time in Atlanta and see a correlation between his style of play and the influence on youth football players who became the players we have today. Vick was to Cam, Wilson, etc. what Kobe is to players like Devin Booker, D'Angelo Russell, and James Harden.

Yes, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time, but if you asked current players who their favorite/most influential basketball player was growing up, a good majority of them would say Kobe because he took the game to another level. So, yes there were successful black QBs who scrambled before Vick, but they did not have the influence and impact on the game like Vick did. 

...and since you're too goddamn stubborn to do any research, here are 3 sections from 3 different articles that say **THE EXACT SAME THING** /u/Freetrain24 and I are saying while also contending to your point that there were successful black scrambling QBs before Vick.

["**Vick came into the league in the afterglow of Cunningham and Slash, and Daunte Culpepper and Donovan McNabb were both established as real deal rookies.** And other mobile quarterbacks, like John Elway and Steve Young (who ran the same 4.53 40 as Colin Kaepernick), had just wrapped up Hall of Fame careers. **But there's a legitimate case to be made that the running quarterback was never really accepted as a design, and not a final resort, until Vick rearranged the calculus of what's possible, even if he never got there himself.**
**The lessons learned with Vick show up in how young, athletic quarterbacks are handled now. They aren't just crammed into a West Coast offense and instructed to only run if absolutely necessary, or tucked behind a run-heavy line and told to just make something happen. They're drafted into systems that accommodate them: think Russell Wilson in Seattle or Andrew Luck in Indianapolis, or, for a little while at least, Robert Griffin III in Washington. Jim Harbaugh's offense probably doesn't look the same without the Michael Vick era. Neither does Chip Kelly's, for that matter. The fundamental ways that football is conceptualized today—speed, misdirection, athleticism—can be found in the contrails that Vick left as he burned through the league.**"](http://deadspin.com/the-big-book-of-black-quarterbacks-1517763742/1550519661)

["Clearly, though, his impact is measured in more than wins, losses and statistics. **Without Vick, many of the wide-open college schemes seen today wouldn't have gained acceptance as quickly to best exploit the talents of RG3, Tebow, Newton, Kaepernick, Johnny Manziel and, most notably this year, Marcus Mariota at Oregon and Dak Prescott at Mississippi State. Those quarterbacks, and eventually, the high-octane offenses they run, filter from college to the pros. Now, high school quarterbacks are being taught how to line up in the pistol and throw from a five-receiver set.**"](http://web.yesnetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20141120&content_id=102017876&fext=.jsp&vkey=news_milb)

["After 13 seasons, Michael Vick, who’s one of the most dynamic and athletic quarterbacks in the history of the game, is calling it a career. Vick’s legacy may be mixed depending on how you ask, but his impact on the game is undeniable. **While he is the modern-day inspiration for the term “dual-threat quarterback”** (a quarterback who can get it done as both a passer and a runner), his career was nearly derailed by legal issues."](http://rollingout.com/2017/02/05/mike-vicks-impact-nfl-undeniable-quarterback-retires/)


stop arguing with this mans, he's actually dumb
I agree that Vick based on his football accomplishments hasn't done much to warrant a jersey retirement - compared to the other jerseys we have retired. 

It's those intangibles, those things in the second half of your comment that makes him worthy of retiring a Falcon. He's the only Falcon ever to grace the cover of Madden and that was before the fan vote system - and it meant something.

I'm the quickest to dismiss Vick for his football talents to my friends and other people who still think he's better than Ryan. But fwiw, I think his time here in Atlanta was a moment that if you lived through it like myself and so many other Falcons fans, you can look back and say yeah he deserves it.
IDK what dude's issue is with Vick, but it's very clear that he shaped a whole generation of QBs: Wilson and Cam in particular come to mind. Every black QB in college I'm willing to bet was inspired by Vick when they were growing up. Vick put the Falcons on the map in the 2000s, if it wasn't for Vick nobody would give a shit about the Falcons. 
i was wet behind the ears, i didn't even know what i was in for, those goddamn DQ blizzards are already some kind of wizard magic of thickness
man first time cookout came to atl i got a milkshake and that shit was impossible to drink for like 30 minutes
I'm conflicted about 2Chainz since he was over there in San Fran repping the Niners the year they beat us in the NFC Championship... never 4get

kek pick one

Yea man, watching the 2014 team play all year knowing they were working to get back to the finals and then for it end the way it did, was incredibly special
these goddamn onions in here!
man those memories flooding back 😭
yea that fit is actually trash and you're an idiot if you think that looks remotely good
I've had this one email since I was in high school ~2007/2008 and signed up for a lot of dumb email alerts from webstores and still get them haha. Too lazy to go through and delete what I don't need anymore.
[Here is mine](http://i.imgur.com/W8gGnR3.jpg)
that somebody? dion waiters
that's why i don't visit there anymore in the offseason and rarely during the season aside from game threads. r/fantasyfootball and here are my two favorite sports subs because there is shitposting *AND* serious discussion which provide for classic threads
> pretty much everyone on the Hawks is in double digits

this got me laughing more than it should have lmao


you and me both my guy :/
you're telling me we can't have our cake and eat it too?! *flips table over*
i've watched the play so many times, but this wasn't reckless. Dangerous? Of course, it happens to guards all the time. 

I think Zaza knew what he was doing, but he also doesn't know if Kawhi is going to land on his foot or not seeing as how his body/head is turned around looking at the shot. 

Like you said, Delly's play in he 2015 playoffs against the Hawks and Celtics were reckless. This not so much. 
I always wish I was born a part of that scene many of my favorite bands came out of the 90s SoCal punk scene. Mine was partly early 00s-10 punk/emo and then late-aughts/early 10s pop-punk scene going into college.
It's been that way for years. I legit got mad when people said Matt Ryan was done or that we need to draft a new QB... Like no you fucking clowns, he's been great every season sans 2015(?) post -Mike Smith and was still just as good then. Same fans saying he was done were the same ones cheering him on at the Super Bowl...
Murray come to play tonight
Destination XXL
picturing wall or kief smacking up furniture in the morning to pump themselves up is goddamn hilarious

here ya go dude! [BURNOUT 3 Soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/user/129290673/playlist/0trjlOKzcDM0oLKisezr2O)
ahaha I feel you though!
dude I have a spotify playlist with the entire soundtrack! I remember it heavily influenced my middle school into high school years. My music tastes changed with that game.
now this is my kinda guy! perfect logic!
why the hawks let teague go i will not understand... watching schroeder play makes me hurt
I am having the same issue. Incredibly frustrating...
It seems as tho it is we that are getting rook't! GG Grizzlies, Conley and Gasol are goddamn studs
John Wall
Agreed! When I first heard IR, I knew in an instant those 3 songs, one after the other, were the perfect sequence of songs. 
I didn't know that people considered Reckoner the best song on IR... the first 5 songs are god tier
Definitely rooting for this guy! I was on the Washington bandwagon this past season, in addition to us having the same name, I was rooting for him 100%!
Instagram on iOS does this for me and it's maddening!

Nice Dream or Street Spirit
[@sidneynotreally](http://www.instagram.com/sidneynotreally)

Hey! I'm Sidney, located in Atlanta, GA. Most of my photography consists of either candid/non-candid shots of friends or people I come across on the street. I intend on updating my feed with studio portraits and more landscapes as to incorporate more techniques into my photography!

Let me know you're from reddit when you follow and I'll hit you back!
good shit!
tl;dr??

this is perfect haha
Nice Dream is severely underrated and underplayed.
Same dude! Made me feel real special that our city had what's being considered one of the best setlists. I loved every minute of it!
I wanted to hear that too but I guess we win some and lose some. First time seeing them, show was fantastic!
SO SAD THEY DIDNT PLAY WEIRD FISHES BUT THEY FUCKING PLAYED STREET SPIRIT, MYXOMATOSIS, AND SUBTERRANEAN HOMESICK ALIEN!  
So theoretically, Piedmont should be good to go in about a month or so? I get off on to Piedmont and get on to 85-S next to where the bridge collapsed and am exposed to the underpass for less than 1 minute tops. 
almost left work and would've been in this as it unfolded, still got home 2 hours later but it would've been much worse
wow! WHY?! WHY MUST THIS HAPPEN?!
lmaoooo 
the best one imo
aw yea no problem!
Hmm, I can't really think of any right now - haven't been watching much in terms of movies. If you like anime films, check out Summer Wars! 
I just bought FIFA 17 cuz my friend was talking shit like I couldn't beat him... I didn't realize ATL UTD wasn't gonna be in there smh
Glad you loved it! I had no expectations going into it and ended up loving every single minute. I really appreciate the time and effort that goes into crafting an animated film whether it be 3D animated or 2D. If you like this style of comedy, the directors (or maybe they were writers of this movie) Phil Lord and Chris Miller also did 21 Jump Street and The Lego Movie. I think they're some of the brightest directors/writers in the business right now. Their style is so sharp.
thank u based eli!
I can totally see that! I think for the sake of this season, they wanted to end on a somewhat happy note, so I have no doubt in my mind this problem will come up in the first episode of S3, but addressed in a way that makes Mickey try to make amends for it. At least, I hope. Now we wait again haha
Fuck yes!!! The first one is honestly one of my favorite movies ever. The writing is fantastic, the delivery and wit and timing of the jokes all hit at the right moments, the animation is very fluid, and the voice acting is wonderful. The second one is also pretty good just a big hour and 15min + food pun fest. Definitely recommend it. They're very hilarious movies
I think this is part of the reason why I'm conflicted about this ending. On one hand, Gus listened to Mickey, attended a few Alanon meetings to figure out what's best for himself and his relationship with Mickey. I think he really acknowledged his own flaws and by not talking to her for those last few days in ATL, I believe he got stronger as a character. We saw Gus conquer or attempt to deal with his own demons at a much faster acceptance rate than Mickey with hers.

On the other hand, Mickey is super fake as fuck for hooking back up with Dustin and not even trying to break it off earlier, but as we've seen throughout this entire series, she is a very conflicted individual who has fucked up enough to attend SLAA and maintain sobriety. Clearly, there are deep character flaws with Mickey that she has to conquer.

But, at least for me, for her to come out at the end and say "hey i really want this" shows me that, even though she did fuck up majorly, she really doesn't want to be a fuck up anymore and Gus will make her happy even if it takes some time. 

I don't know if the Dustin thing will break them up, I really don't want it to, Gus and Mickey's happy moments really touched me and they're good people as you mentioned. Really my heart can't take them being broken up after this whirlwind of a season haha. However, I hope it does cause some strain and a little contention in Gus next season. I want to see Mickey continue to get her act together and actually not fuck up anymore.

Also, Chris and Bertie should totally be together. Prime opportunity for comedic gold between the two of them. Make that happen writing team!
bro same. i've never been this worked up over a show before but this one is so relatable that it actually got me pissed off at Mickey these last few episodes.
She definitely had to know that was shitty. But being judged and acknowledged for it is the consequence for your actions. Such a bad move on her part, I can't help but wonder if Bertie possibly moving out in the next season will be a plot point.
Oh shit! I forgot about that. That would've been perfect.
Fuck this episode. Mickey is an asshole. Not just to Gus but to Bertie as well for no reason. 

and now I gotta go to work and think about what's gonna happen in the finale ugh
Mickey texting Dustin over Gus fucked me up... just no
shit me too tbh
throwback thursday as fuck!!! i used to love this show as a kid
Beta testing for a console? LMAO now i've heard it all. That's honestly one of the stupidest things I have ever heard. Sooner or later companies will just release the system with no games and tell you to imagine playing Mario or Zelda and you'll be shoving money at it hand over fist 😂

Overall, my point is that a basic feature expected on a console in 2017 should be in the console regardless of what the purpose of the console is. Sony and Microsoft somehow managed to get Netflix, Hulu, etc. day 1 AND have more than 5 games available for launch. Wow! Somebody get Shuhei Yoshida and Phil Spencer on the phone and tell them games consoles are supposed to be for gaming! 

Somehow we've found an excuse for Nintendo because "they should be focused on games" never mind their competitors seemed to do it without issue. It's absolutely retarded the logic in this sub towards Nintendo's actions. I want to upgrade from my Wii U but until Nintendo can put value into the console, it's just $300 paperweight. 
Because it's a basic feature that's included with every console under the sun. How is that that hard to grasp? If I'm paying $300 for a console with no games it better offer something other than gaming. With as many Netflix applications that are available across a multitude of platforms it should be a no-brainer to include it. 

It's people like you that keep giving Nintendo a free pass on bullshit and they keep falling further and further behind the times. Nintendo released a half-assed console and you drones ate it up just to play Zelda and multi-year old ports for 6 months. 
What? Uncharted 4 is literally $32 right now on Amazon and $37.99 at Best Buy
1) Netflix and Microsoft intentionally downgrade the quality on Chrome and Firefox n PC. You only get 1080p if you use the Netflix app, which you have to download through the Windows App Store and the Windows App Store is an atrocity right now.

2) Phone screen is too small. I only use Youtube in this regard and even then I keep it to short form videos. 

3) The convenience of having everything on one console so I don't have to switch sources to do something as common as watch Netflix on any given platform. 

also, I know about my TV haha it being 2017 has nothing to do with it having 1 HDMI port. I got the TV in 2010. I haven't cable in years and use the TV for gaming so the need to upgrade hasn't been a necessity. 
who uses a PHONE to play games? do you see how dumb that sounds? Consoles are expected to do more than just game. You can buy a games console and play games and STILL USE IT FOR OTHER FEATURES... mind boggling, I know. The only problem is Zelda is the only game worth a shit out for the next 6 months. 

If people didn't want to stream from whichever consoles they have hooked up to the TV, then the 3 previous consoles and the Switch's contemporaries wouldn't have a plethora of streaming apps. Personally, my TV has one HDMI input, if I'm done playing Zelda for the day and want to watch Netflix, I have to get up and go to my TV, switch out (pun not intended haha) my Switch HDMI cord for the PS4 one and then start using the PS4 to watch Netflix. That's ridiculous. Netflix and co. should already be on there from day 1. It's 2017.
Congrats you don't care. Obviously, plenty of other people do or else Nintendo wouldn't be addressing such a basic feature that should be in every electronic device with a screen in 2017.
It doesn't have to be important at launch, it should be in there regardless. It's a B A S I C F E A T U R E.

It's a big deal because there are people in the world who aren't as fortunate as you to have multiple devices that can play Netflix or Hulu or whatever. If every other gaming console has streaming services, it makes absolutely 0 sense for the Switch not to have it. Excuses fanboys come up with for Nintendo are mind boggling. 

edit for the record: VC and streaming should've both been in the console from day 1 and it's a shame they're not in it. 
it's a basic feature that should be there regardless of if the consoles is for gaming. Phones are meant for communicating yet YouTube comes pre-installed on every Android device. Hell, the 3DS has YouTube and I wouldn't ever consider watching videos on those screens.
Lose DiMarco, re-sign Matt Schaub... [fam](http://i.imgur.com/Ikskcds.jpg)
FUCK THIS NOISE!
this would legitimately be the funniest thing to happen this season
Congrats then! I hope this is the fan experience you've been dreaming off since ATL UTD was granted club-ship.
I understand that the lines should never be 45+ minutes for any kind of concessions - yes, it is absurd. But it's also absurd complaining about a situation that is outside of their control.

The whole "Fan Experience" push can't really be controlled in a stadium that isn't their own where they have very little say in how concessions and other stadium commodities are distributed. That's why they're building MB Stadium. MB Stadium is being fitted and prepped to be the premiere destination for ATL UTD and the fans. Fans being able to watch the team play at BDS is really just drumming up support for when MBS finally opens up and the team can play their first real home game in their own stadium/atmosphere - not saying that this first home game wasn't spectacular. The "Fan Experience" will be better, trust me, you're not meant to get the "Fan Experience" they want you to get at BDS. It won't be like this when the new dome opens up. 

I can see where you're coming from - for ATL UTD, they'd probably more concerned with this if it were happening at MB Stadium under their own accord as opposed to a place they're renting out for a few games across 4 months.
seriously, especially over something not that serious like beer. Bobby Dodd isn't accommodated to sell alcohol. There's only so many places you can store beer around their concessions areas. 

but really, it's beer... if not getting a beer is souring your game experience, maybe you should just watch the game at home and drink as much beer as you like. 
this is beautiful thank you
My game glitched so I had to restart the game again, haha. Literally, the options for text and voice language were not there.
yea i googled. I ended up deleting and reinstalling the game again and now it's gucci.
what part of "accidentally" did you not understand?
accidentally started in french text and there's no fucking option to change it back to english who the hell came up with that bright idea?
make-up artists don't do concept art -_____- 
Totally understandable my man
I truly don't understand why this is a talking point. These people are athletes, being competitive is in their nature. 

"Man, I'm so glad we scored these points so far, I hope they don't comeback on us."
Especially now that they paywalled basically every past episode except the past "best ofs" and some episodes from the past 6 months
wow go fuck yourself
dude i was just asking myself if there was a subreddit for hot ones!
I honestly didn't know 3D was still a trend in movies. I thought that died out 3 years ago. 
I just started watching the series from the beginning - I was an on and off watcher of random episodes and enjoyed it - and I noticed the incredible amount of rape, pedophilia, mentally challenged jokes in the first 2 seasons. At first, I was a little hesitant to laugh but then I realized that these characters are meant to be this way as it gives way to the overarching premise of the show: these are horrible people who will do anything to benefit themselves before others no matter the others' circumstances.
never seen anything like this before. Boogie's like "a huge weight has just been lifted off my shoulders"
no
this is wild lmao
aw man and I was starting to like the kid :/ as a falcons fan, I am obligated to dislike him
LMAO this comment is being underappreciated in here
Agreeing with you here. It made me a little sad when I realized that Atlanta proper is just three small cities held together by 285.
Holy shit yes. Some friends and I routinely go to downtown to shoot pictures and hang out but every time we get really bored because 1) the city is dead as fuck and 2) we've seen everything there is that's worth giving a damn about having lived here all our lives.

After 7 PM, it's like the city dies - stores close, people head back home to the suburbs, the homeless come back out. 
God I hope so just to make it even more hilarious
so it was him?! that sonofabitch >:(
YOU MAKE ME SAD!
I get that. I just responded to another comment regarding this. Since they did take it to 7 games, it's hard to argue that the Warriors were as handicapped as the Cavs were since they still could have won it in Game 7. 
I mean I personally don't care to argue about it too much becuase like you said it's a 1-1 split, I just find that it seems a bit disingenuous to argue that the Warriors were "handicapped" to the same level as the Cavs the year before when the Cavs other two best players were physically unable to play. 

The Warriors had a 3-1 lead and I still felt like Kyrie and Love didn't make a difference even in the Cavs win because Draymond's suspension played a much more pivotal role in shifting that momentum for the Cavs than the play of Irving and Love down the stretch.
ehhh, Curry still played tho. Irving and Love were literally unable to play. 
So he does have ties to Quinn and Carroll? I told my pops a few hours ago that I wasn't sure. That's good to know there's some previous familiarity then. I'm excited for this upcoming season, hopefully we can repeat the success we had this year and take home the Lombardi next time around.
man if we got eric berry through some voodoo free agency magic....


WEWWWWWW 
Tell Von Miller to give Beasley some of that "Return to the Super Bowl after embarrassing loss" magic! 
Oh yea for sure. I think this season was a testament to how crucial an O-line is to Ryan's success. We got Mack on a 5-year deal IIRC and Jake Long is still growing. I think one solid draft pick on the OL would alleviate any concerns I have, if any, about our OL going forward. 
When I look at him, Ryan isn't built like the other QBs.  Aside from Brady and Brees, they have an inch on him and a few of them weigh more as well. Brees is short and kind of stocky for QB. Ryan is much leaner than them I can say that. However, Ryan is a much better scrambler than Brady, Manning, and Big Ben though, which is why I can see him taking more big hits when he's outside the pocket as opposed to the other guys. 

Not knocking him, I just don't think he'll last as long as we want him to, but I could be proven entirely wrong over the next 7-10 years.
I could be wrong but the difference I see between guys like Brady, Peyton, Roethlisberger, Rivers, and Brees - he's the exception to this because he's short - these guys can play into their late 30s even early 40s because they're not mobile or small (sans Brees) so they are much less likely to take hard hits and get rattled by bulky LBs and DEs like many QBs drafted post-2011 who scramble outside the pocket way more than the 5 I listed above. 

I'd be shocked if Matt Ryan played into his late 30s to be quite honest.
Quinn stated in his presser today that things won't change playbook wise and that Sark will maybe add some things here and there but by and large it will remain unchanged.

I think an offensive overhaul would be hugely detrimental to everyone on the offense's growth.
Idk if Loomis is gonna bust up the band rather Brees might retire sooner rather than later and kind of force the Saints hand. I can never read Payton but I think he'd last much longer than Brees. 

Next season, the NFC South is anybody's game really.
it'd be risky if he made it seem like there was turmoil between the two parties but this seems like a win-win for everyone
Could I have you explain things to me all the time becuase this was ELI5 perfection
Many of them do have other jobs. I can't imagine there's a lot that goes into being a NFL cheerleader for 8 Sundays over the course of a few months . 
so much pain, so much let down, i feel shame. dirty shame 😔
My only complaint is that our flair in /r/nfl isn't an upside down Falcon with a beer bottle in its hand. Nothing can numb the pain but we can laugh - at least I hope. 
I called this immediately after the game. We play the AFC East already this season so that was a given after we lost. 
Don't ask me lol we didn't ask for this!
Yea i was more speaking to Freeman getting blamed for that whiffed block, that fumble happened way before the play where he got sacked on that 2nd down play late in the 4th. I thought the sack play is what this particular comment chain was taking about. I'm probably misunderstanding your comment! 
well tune in in a few months when /r/nfl ranks him the 4th best qb in the NFC South again because of this Super Bowl loss
that was a totally different play....
ITT no one read the article and just wants to complain about a new conspiracy. The author clearly states *numerous* times that the timeout isn't the reason they lost the game
not sure how you took that away from this article but ok lol nobody from the Falcons said anything - clearly whoever wrote this article pieced this together after browsing Twitter.
http://i.imgur.com/jPDgGw7.png 

got this lovey PM yesterday lol like I don't even understand what the point of this was
LeBron with the DAD DICK
Hell nah. This team is totally different than teams of the past. In 2012, when we were 10 yards away from going to Super Bowl 47(?), that team was made up of veterans, a ton of guys who, in that moment, it was make or break for them - Super Bowl or they'll be hanging up the cleats soon. 

This team here is young. Freeman and Coleman in their 4th and 3rd years, Austin Hooper looks like he'll become a stud soon, Alex Mack finally tasting playoffs and a Super Bowl berth. Our D-line is young and hungry, Vic Beasley going into his 3rd year, De'Vondre, Deion, Poole, and Keanu all getting not only the NFL experience but playing in the SUPER BOWL in their rookie seasons that is valuable to the development of young players. 

This team will be hungry especially after being so close. It's up to them to take this loss on their shoulders and use it as fire for next season and the season after that and so on. 

Quinn and Co. should take this week to recover then shift their focus to the draft, scoping out defensive playmakers - a quick and ferocious DE, ballhawks in the linebacker position, pick up a safety, and try their hardest to sign a big time FA. 

I fully believe this team will compete next year for a Super Bowl and given our schedule this upcoming season they'll do it facing some great competition. 
Just run with it... unlike what the Falcons did yesterday to crush our hearts ToT
Falcons fan here... I haven't listened to anything all day because I feel no emotions right now. Nothing is enjoyable.
Definitely some School of Andy Reid Clock Management shit happening out there in the 4th.
Yeah that is true. When I left the bars, everyone was really just in shock. I saw one person crying and a ton of drunk dudes just yelling lmao. Part of me wanted to win for the riot alone but alas here we are 🤷🏾‍♂️
one of these days, Atlanta sports teams will win championships and THEY'LL BE THE ONES BURNING DOWN OTHER CITIES! 
More time for commercials for the NFL, seems like a win-win to me! An extra quarter shortened to 7-8 minutes seems appropriate at least in the playoffs. Regular season not so much, but for playoffs, the NFL should explore the possibilities. 
I don't see how anyone can argue that we wouldn't be asking this same question if the Falcons won. There were articles up immediately after the game about this exact thing. 

On one hand, I agree, play defense and stop them - but it's really not that simple. This isn't Madden. The other team should at least have the opportunity to match because chances are that they probably won't go down the field and score a TD.

I definitely think an argument can be made that OT would actually be better if it wasn't sudden death if the team that lost the coin toss got an opportunity because that's the do or die moment - score a TD or take the L. Because at that point, it's really all on you. 
man... i'm honestly just in disbelief. no tears, just pride and disappointment at the same time. It's not like they came and got punched in the mouth (which was my biggest fear - is that we get embarrassed all game), they just couldn't finish and ended up on the wrong side of history - again. 
plz don't 
Is this what death feels like? 

but really, our defense got gassed the fuck out of. They had no time to rest, we have no depth at linebacker positions, and we stopped running the ball. Probably one of the best Super Bowls I've ever seen though even if it was at the hands of defeat for my team. Brady and James White knew they were gassed and they picked them apart.
FUCKING HYPED AS FUCK! ALL WEEK THEY SAID OUR DEFENSE WAS SUSPECT! WELL LOOK AT US NOW! 
y'all i am already shedding tears at how well we are playing
we outchea!!!!
same!
nice! rise up! 
Where is everyone watching the game?
what is this song???
oh nahhh
fitting that you have 69 upvotes for this comment
that's really beautiful. I live in Atlanta but often times I wonder what it would be like to live somewhere as rural as that
It's Falcons Friday at work and we're having a pep rally later today in the office! A bunch of people wearing red and Falcons jerseys today! Even our CEO is hyped!
lmaooo
Because Francis Scott Key was a slave-owner and vehemently racist... Calling the US the "Land of the Free" when it is the exact opposite of that for many people then and still now is hypocrisy at it's finest blinded by patriotism and nationalism. I don't have to respect the national anthem at all. I respect our soldiers, but not a song.
I'm not a fan of the national anthem and the pre-kickoff shenanigans that happen but goddamn his performance makes me feel extremely patriotic
Drew, I respect you and used to like you when you were in San Diego... but for the love of god and my sanity twice a year, PLEASE LEAVE. 

thank you :)
you are aware these guys are competitors right so what do you want him to say?
it's easily one of my favorite movies ever. the wit, animation, voice acting are all top notch
Easily top 5 Player Tribune articles. I truly truly hope they retire Vick's jersey to the rafters simply for what he meant to Atlanta in his 6 years here. He was such THE integral part to bringing the Falcons from a middle of the road franchise to and exciting franchise that people would want to watch on Sundays.
I want to feel bad for u but california literally gets everyone multiple times while whole regions get ignored :(
both outcomes would be great tbh. let's say both teams join together therefore there is only one team thus one winner!
My friend invited me to a party going on there on Facebook but I haven't checked the invite since he sent it to me. Let me find it and Ill link you up!
i love this so v much
Holy shit it's real! Let's take this moment in you guys. only 8 more days!
I was telling my friends the same thing - Halo CTF was lit as fuck
Didn't know so many people bought the game for the box art...
lmao actually let out a hearty chuckle at this one
was he supposed to say something else? I'm confused how this is news
Awesome response thank you! 
Digging this a lot. Very chill and laid back!
What was the first time you guys knew you wanted to make music and play to people across the world?
They used to have this exact thing in Madden when you would do franchise mode and do the camps, there was a punting game where you got points based on where it landed. I'd love to see that brought to the Pro Bowl
I could probably get Tokyo vibes here in America by just going to NYC honestly, but something about the way Tokyo is so condensed and close together makes me feel there's so many nooks and crannies to explore. 

Kyoto would be great to capture on film though. 
love this so much. really want to travel to tokyo in the future!
thems the facts b
you're kidding on the part about no cover right?!
probably people that complained about the new stadium
wish people left Hogan this open often during the regular season, coulda used him a few times in my fantasy team :(((((
The great Matt Flynn!
hey it me ur broter
I really hope we can win this whole thing so all the "experts" and media pundits can shut up questioning Matt Ryan's talent. Yes, he was 1-4 coming into this playoffs, but playoffs are not the end-all-be-all barometer for QB success - after all it is a TEAM sport. 
Putting all my faith in the Falcons to seal the deal for all the bird bros that died at the hands of the Patriots in the big one!
That's going to be the pinnacle of game watching!
Cam last year was just as unstoppable as our offense this season. If he can get back to there, the NFCS will be the best division in football hands down.
More parity is always a good thing :D
Understandable. Although this is less to do with the fans, I wanted to root for the Panthers last year in the Super Bowl because Cam went to my HS but the team itself was so insufferable last season I couldn't bring myself to root for just Cam.
It's definitely because of the algorithm, I guarantee it wouldn't be that way if we were still on the old algorithm. One of the posts on r/falcons had over 11k upvotes - our second highest post is 3300+ upvotes.

NFCN fans - if you've ever been in their subs - they've all basically become r/packers2,3,4 . I'm subbed the the Bears subreddit and last week they were basically in civil war over posting Packers losing and memes over actual Bears content.
Seriously. An entire fanbase is all of a sudden the worst because some people on reddit antagonized you... like c'mon now be reasonable.
don't let bad apples ruin your mood. I'm sure there were Packers fans shitting on Cowboys fans after you guys won.
wow, that was so fucking easy, so smooth. damn Brady, u scary
Cam should be entering/or in his peak tho, could make for great battles and probably a new rivalry down south!
I feel like plans are being made for something downtown as we speak!
not gonna lie that made me laugh really hard, but usually our sub isn't as bad as it was leading up to the game vs you guys. It basically became r/atlantahawks2. we've never been so hype about the team
lmao I cannot wait to see how salty he's gonna be tomorrow!
Jameis is gonna be a threat for real. Excited for him to come into his own.
lol it's the r/the_donald after one season of shitposting? dramatic much

GMFB showed both the Raiders and Falcons love this season. I loved catching the re-runs of their show
i feel really confident about this Sunday!!

the real dagger in the back haha
this will be my first time seeing radiohead so i'm hoping tickets are around $100 for GA - and hoping i can grab one before they sell out
i'll be there!
It's definitely historical. Historically, the Falcons and the NFC South has not been good. It helps that the Packers have been one of the best most consistent teams the past 7-8 years too so it just bolsters that historical argument. 
well they did win *one*
Can Matt Ryan get it done in the playoffs?
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

HOLY SHIT IVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY

when have the Patriots not been favorites to win anything? If I was a betting man, I'd never bet against the Patriots. No way, Jose!
I like Pete Prisco from CBS a lot. He seems to be fairly high on us a lot of times.
this is how I am and I am much further than you are :/
Julio Jones played injured in nearly half the games this season - Jordy Nelson and Davante Adams (or Parker not sure which one is on the Packers lol) played much better than Julio this season. Not Matt Ryan's fault Taylor Gabriel decided to ball out mid-season.
already way ahead opf u!
This is actually fucking hilarious. Gave you a follow!


Just gave you a follow! Absolutely loving your feed. I'm definitely going to be looking out for your posts!

Gave you a follow! I love your tones and the sharpness of your images, they're gorgeous! 
Gave you a follow! Definitely loving the portraits - looking to get more into portraits as the year progresses!

Hey! I'm [@sidneynotreally](https://www.instagram.com/sidneynotreally). I mainly do street photography through portraits of my friends around Atlanta. I recently acquired a film camera so I'll be posting film shots as well. Hoping to move more into landscapes and studio portraits this year.
I used to work at the one in Newnan and seeing this pic plus your comment makes me feel so bad for the people that still work there :/ I hope they're getting OT or something if they are working past their shifts

social justice warriors, people who advocate for social justice or equality in everything. some see them as nutjobs, others see them as doing great work - do your research and figure out which side of the fence you're on about SJWs.

But anyway, some people have criticized the band for "slut-shaming" in many of the songs on Under Soil & Dirt - which is why, i assume, TSSF hasn't played many songs of US&D in recent years.
Love Slow Magic! Saw him in 2015 with Giraffage, great energy at his live shows!

one of these announcers sounds like he's really pissed he has to cover a Niners game lol we get it dude they are 1-12, we know, they know it, everyone knows it.
I'm still upset about that 2012 NFCCG. I still cry into my Falcons body pillow on the eve of every NFCCG.
who's the qt in the photo ??
Yea I ended up restarting the game and it put back at the beginning of the dungeon. Very annoying. It kind of soured my mood for the rest of that chapter :/
I am so glad I am not the only one who had problems with this asshole! It legit took me 6 hours to beat him and once I passed him, I basically cried.
Gotcha! I've been telling all my friends who do have PS4s to get 2.8 and the Remixes so they will have plenty to tide them over until 3.
> I would argue that none of the non-numbered games emulate the gameplay of 1 and 2, and can see why others may still classify them as spin-offs as a result.

Honestly, I think SE did themselves a relatively noticable disservice to the brand releasing all those non-numbered games on handhelds. 

I know anecdotal evidence doesn't mean much, but I know 10 good friends who either have played none or only one of the handheld games after KH2 - due to a) having little to no interest in any game that wasn't KH3 and b) not owning or being interested in playing handheld games.

In fact, one of my college roommates, bought Birth By Sleep from a local game shop after he found his PSP after moving in and he loved it. But he didn't play any of the DS games.

My cousin is another person who loved Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2, but once they started releasing more and more games on handheld and not Kingdom Hearts 3, he just stopped caring about it. I think he'll pick up KH3 now, but I don't think he'll be playing any of the remixes.

It's great that they are releasing them all on once console early next year - especially given how quiet the beginning of year is for gaming - it could prove to be a really strong move generating buzz in KH3 going into E3 and that Winter 2018 release window looming being either January to March 2018 or December 2018.
But then at that point, you're asking people to spend money on a console they likely don't have. If someone has an Xbox and played 1 and 2 on PS2, why would they go spend another $2-300 plus the price of both 2.8 and 1.5/2.5 Remix just for the other 5-6 games that weren't on PS2?

Would it be in their best interests to do so? Yes, but also they can watch Let's Plays and read the stories of those games on a wiki, which is relatively free compared to buying a whole new console.
Anyone else have a weird glitch during "The Sword in the Waterfall" quest where  you can't open the game's menu or use any button prompts and your party members are no longer with you?
I know this is 11 days later but this same shit just happened to me and it's really annoying. Do I really have to restart the game in order to fix this?
Thanks, I'm still working out the kinks of the controls but I'm not too far into the game for it to make a huge detriment.
okay cool. I figured I needed to tap it right before the attack. Clearly, I need to work on my timing haha

So I may be dumb, but in control scheme B on PS4, do you block by tapping L1 when it appears on screen or can you hold it and it will block automatically? I keep messing this up resulting in lots of damage being taken and missed parries :/ 

any clarity would be greatly appreciated!
Alex Mack plays center tho...
Thanks for the suggestion! I'll look into it :)
I know I want to stick to manual focus on a film camera - at least starting out. Contax has been getting a lot of love but it would be nice to invest in some vintage Zeiss glass. The RTS IIIs I'm seeing are in really good condition and they are priced right at my budget tipping point.
The Nikon F series that I've seen are upwards of $300. But I really like the Pentax K1000 form factor. It's been recommended a lot on lists of beginner film cameras to learn on.
Not a particular budget, but I'll likely top off at $300 for a camera and lens if it's thrown in. 

I'm not too worried about compatibility really, so I'm open to looking at any film camera!

So far, I've found the Canon AE-1, Nikon FM2n, Pentax K-100, and the Minolta SRT-101
Good to know! Contax seems to have a pretty good reputation from what I've read and am hearing.
I shoot with Canon at the moment, but I have debated switching over to Nikon. If that is the case with the current mount being the same as the new mount then I would strongly consider making a switch both with film and digital.

Thanks for that info!
Contax, definitely going to look into that. I've been seeing that name a lot on eBay!
Hey guys,

What is a good film camera to get as a beginner film camera? I've been shooting DSLRs for a good 2 1/2 to 3 years now, but recently I've been seeing a lot of my friends shoot on film and produce great looking pics. 

Part of me wants to go with a Canon A-E1 for the fact that there is probably a ton of vintage Canon glass available. 

Do you guys have any other film camera recommendations worth looking into?
Tight! I've been looking at Tubulars but I have a small frame so I'm not sure how it'd look on me, but they have a good handful of pairs I want
id on shoes? 

really like this fit dude!

Atlanta Falcons offense: "Stop a blitz? Protect our QB? How do you do that?"
Haha I remember your comment! Once Alamby left it definitely had a tonal shift. Over the last two years, it got much more silly and less serious/encouraging. 
Someone posted a thread earlier this week about him posting another video on this channel earlier this week asking if it was a sign that he was leaving DRTV. 

Well here's your answer mate. 

I'm looking forward to seeing what Kai will do on his own. DRTV was one of the first photography channels I followed closely when I started out and his personality made their videos fun while also maintaining some level of informative(ness?). 
Haven't watched Regular Show in about 2 years (no cable, fell off) but holy fuck this episode! Dragonforce, the insanity, reminded me why I fell in love with this show in college
Damn this is really fucking inspiring! Love it!
Just got home and started the game up! So hyped even though I know virtually nothing about these particular games haha! 

Got work in the morning too but I might just say fuck it and stay up to play at least a good hour!
geez
I agree this wasn't the best place to showcase this game, ***Conan's audience is not the audience that is going to buy or play Final Fantasy.*** 

This Clueless Gamer segment is not going to be a make or break moment for FF15. This game has been long coming for a decade. The people that are going to buy it will and those that want an RPG to play will pick it up.

Tabitha, mom of 3 in Normaltown, Kansas, is not going to see this and be like "Oh this game looks awful and boring" and not buy it for her kid. Chances are her kid wants the latest Call of Duty or Battlefield or Watch Dogs 2. 

Relax people.
In the video in the article, they mention a guy died
Ah yes, the classic New Orleans voodoo magic found its way up to Philadelphia, haha
Whew! What a game. GG iggles, Falcons take this bye and fix ur shit! Now where's the whiskey
Well at least the game is almost over so I can drink the rest of the day with a purpose
Who the hell is Josh Perkins?! Lol
LMFAO fuck everything about this game. It's like neither team truly wants to win but the Eagles are winning but they want to lose
Teamwork!
Yeah it's really bullshit. While I think players should have some kind of repercussion for these kind of hits, the refs REALLY need a kick in the ass because this season has been absolute shit for officiating.
Dude got downvoted so fast lmao
Y'all smell that? That's Goodell cooking up a hefty fine for Neal
There's not a toys r us near me lol that's all
son of a bitch! I literally just bought the Pokemon Sun/Moon N3DSXL from GameStop an hour ago
The Pokemon Red and Blue 3DSs sold out insanely quickly and can only be bought from resellers on line for like a $100+ markup. 

The every day consumer won't be rushing out to get one but the scumbag resellers will.
Nah man, the fanboys on /r/apple are in the future already and never have to do anything everyone else has to do! 
:(
I honestly don't know anymore. Moncrief I sat because I keep tricking myself into thinking Kelvin Benjamin's Bum Ass will actually get a TD each week and put up double digit points. As for Running Backs, I have Ajayi and Forte starting and Booker was projected to get 14.7 points as opposed to Murray's 8.7. I also expected the Colts to get shellacked and that didn't happen so naturally Frank Gore went off.
I don't know why I still try.... Murray, Gore, and Moncrief all on my bench for fucking Devontae Booker and Amari Cooper... Cooper can't get shit because all his targets are goddamn DPIs and Booker is shitting the bed. I'm playing the Taco of our league (0-7 right now) and he's got Hauschka and Michaels playing tomorrow. 
Yeah but the difference is KD went to the team that beat him when his old team was up 3-1 in the playoffs. That's the big issue not that the Warriors are stacked, it's that he went to the team that beat him 3-1 in the last series before the Finals. 

LeBron leaving Cleveland in 2010 is much less egregious because Cleveland wasn't signing any free agents that were worth their salt on the court. But also, that is irrelevant to the point /u/Harris132 was making.
so the Buccs are gonna be holding tryouts for running backs this week?
lmao
I gotchu fam
whew! can't wait to transfer that wirelessly with my shitty WiFI signal in my built in the late 70s brick house! T~T
True, but it fits in the SD slot since it's a full size SD adapter. It's much less egregious than having a card reader the size of a stack of Post-Its attached by USB - I think that's people's biggest issue
They hate adapters they have to buy, the SD card adapter comes with al microSD cards. 

or were you being sarcastic lol
Medium Format is top level, if it was a tad more affordable, I would love to shoot with it.
There are pro photographers that use mirrorless for studio shoots. If you are a good professional, your studio is well lit enough that you can shoot with any camera and not worry about image quality. 

https://fstoppers.com/originals/why-i-cant-use-mirrorless-camera-professionally-151340

The only reason people say pros don't use mirrorless cameras is because uninformed people think "little camera = not professional, big camera = very professional".

The a7R and a7R II shoot higher megapixels and better colors than the 5D Mark IV, so image quality is irrelevant.
whew that's a $600 increase over the mark I
his username is macjunkie, what do you think? lol
I feel like everything you're saying is falling on deaf ears in here mate :/
microSD cards usually come with it's own adapter to fit in a standard SD card slot...
Pros definitely shoot mirrorless lol
Dude, Johnathan Morrison pissed me off when he tweeted that instead of bitching about these missing features and ports on the new MBPros we should be excited about the two awesome days in tech we got. 

-__- he can fuck off - this MBPro is a downgrade from everything that made it a "Pro" computer.
Fuck yes! I was contemplating buying a PS3 to get KH 1.5/2.5, but now I don't have to!
TEARS IN MY EYES! 
Fuck this is awesome! I just switched to Verizon back in August!
I know and each one of those weeks I have started him in hopes he goes off. I see a favorable matchup for Bernard and Cleveland and of course Hill gets all his touches so I'm double fucked
Matt Forte why do you hate me so? The one week you decide to fucking go off I have you on my bench for goddamn Gio Bernard.... fuck me
LMFAO yah okay
ur ghey

I don't like the Panthers, but I don't like the Saints more and it feels dirty rooting for them in this game but goddamn am I loving every second of this.
I got Folie from my aunt for Christmas one year and I fell in love with it. Is it TTTYG or FUTCT? No, but it contains the same flair as both those albums and shows how versatile FOB could be. Is it my favorite or best FOB album? Nah, but it caps off wonderfully, an era of FOB that is gone but has their place in music history.
Probably. I haven't been keeping up with what's going on with that tho so I'm holding out hope that maybe we'll get Utada for the final chapter
Pretty sure their lawyers have decided it's not worth it...
I won their 20mm f/1.4 Art EF-mount lens in a raffle back in February and it's easily one of my favorite lenses I have ever used. Nice wide angle lens, great build quality, and captures excellent colors. It's probably the one reason I've stuck with Canon cameras because I don't want to get rid of it, haha.
That reasoning alone moves this guy to the top of my list of favorite CEOs haha
Dang, now I wish someone on our team had the name Jim so I could respond with "Jim-jammed" :(
DiMarco is pretty stud-like himself! Our three headed backfield beast! 
My son, my blind faith in this hype train knows no bounds! 
I totally see them playing off each other. I am VERY glad we have them both!
My prediction Vikings 27 - Falcons 30! 

*deja vuuuuu*
My sentiments exactly! I was like there's no way we win any of our games in the second quarter of the season but here we are with Ws against Carolina and Denver. 

I still think Seattle and Green Bay pose a real threat to us, but I still have hope that we can get through both of them with Ws and go to the bye week at one loss. 

If not, three loses ain't too bad. Shouldn't have lost to Tampa tho.
I think you guys will be good haha. They honestly just got beat up by our RBs, but aside from that Denver defense has played damn good this season. 

If anything, Carolina's D has taken the crown for most overrated D - rightfully so >:^ )
My bro was like "from what I've seen Coleman is better". I'm like okay well from what I've seen, as a Falcons fan that watches every game, Freeman is better. 
We weren't supposed to beat Carolina or Denver. We weren't even supposed to have a winning record right now. But here the fuck we are! This isn't like last year - this is different. 

If we can make it to the bye week with only losing to possibly Green Bay and Seattle, I think we'll be in good position to go to the post season!
Coleman in open space is real dangerous because of that light form and speed. He's insane! I wish we got to see more of him purely rushing because I think if he can find the holes - he'll be unstoppable.  
Legitimately made me howl!
Why does Denver's QB keep ending up getting hit by our DEs? What is this new football mechanic?
Same here. I agree that Coleman is faster and a better receiver. 

Freeman is a traditional, beat down rusher. He's gonna fight for those yards and nobody can take him down.

I certainly am not trying to argue for getting rid of one though because they're probably two of our biggest assets. Opposing teams have to worry about both of them.
It'd be real great if Miami stopped wasting Jarvis Landy's fucking time and trade him or get him a good QB so he can be valuable! FUCK!
Sweet baby Jesus! I just grabbed the Finn variant. Very excited about this!
You know you can order the limited edition on Amazon too

Incredibly sad to hear this! :( I love this show so much and the friends I have made by simply mentioning that it's one of my favorite cartoons ever has been great. Guess now I gotta spend the next two years watching every episode and finally get those AT tattoos I've been wanting. 

It's been a real fun ride.

I see Matt Ryan was back there trying to play defender on that Freeman run. Calm down there Matty, we need you
Same here. I loved every bit of it.
mmm yes, I agree
The opener is one of my favorite tracks off the album. It's so fucking good!
This is basically what I want right now but I can't afford it :( I love your space man
I'm glad I didn't watch the trailer for Season 2 then haha
Tbf Motion City Soundtrack have been touring and playing together non-stop since 1997. They were due for a break at some point. Part of me hopes they do anniversary shows in the future 
Well who would've guessed...
Mine went fairly smooth. I had an iPad Mini during my 3 years with Android, so I was up-to-date on apps and already knew what I was going to use if I ever made the switch back. 

I switched from a Nexus 6 to the S7 edge then to the iPhone 6s. I really enjoyed all the cool features both phones had to offer - Nexus getting Android updates as soon as they're available, dual front facing speakers, on both phones the notification bar/menu was phenomenal, being able to set default apps was great, having a dedicated back and multitasking system wide, and Google Now. 

However, having iMessage and FaceTime, the smaller form-factor of the 6s, TouchID, the smoothness of iOS, 3D Touch is actually incredibly useful, and functioning apps like Snapchat (which is absolutely shit on Android) enticed me that the move would be worth it. I still use mostly Google services on my 6s, so it's not so bad not having them integrated into the system. If Google releases another tablet, I might buy it just to stay within the Android ecosystem in some regard.
Nice!
Hey there's my office building right across the street! I saw you spinning around today haha :)
I really really could not stop gushing to people about how good season 1 was. Probably my favorite first season of any show; phenomenal I'd say haha.

As you mentioned, the resolution, for me, pushed this season above the previous. Plus, with the addition of several characters - both new and old - they provided substantial-enough storylines to prop up the show as Pablo was in hiding. This season they added just the right amount of drama and heightened tension.

I loved Jhon's transformation over the last 7 (?) episodes and we got to see more of Tata and how she was dealing with constantly running while caring for the two kids. 
Great season! I couldn't imagine how they could top season 1 but they fucking did it. 

They really ramped up the action in this one - not to say the last season wasn't action packed. Been seeing a lot of dislike thrown towards episodes 8 and 9 and their pacing. I actually liked seeing Pablo experience the world for what it is - outside of the drugs, constant paranoia, and violence. My favorite scene was probably Pablo talking to Gustavo in the park as he was possibly coming to terms with the end. 

Also, RIP Carrillo
Same here haha "worked" from home today
NOT CARRILLO! Fuck :( he was the ultimate badass. Season 2 got me fucked up
These are dope!
I think it's September 8th
the levels of pretentiousness in this thread is TOO DAMN HIGH! lmao
whatchu tryna say? I didn't say it was the greatest album of all time
this is beautiful, it's definitely not like channel orange but that's a good thing. both these albums existing in their own spectrum. definitely will be keeping this playing for the next few months
Holy shit! I'm friends with you guys' old drummer haha. Saw you play at our university last year. Love your stuff!
Just switched back over to iOS from Android the past 3 years and I don't know what it is about iOS but I felt like I was home haha. Everything just feels so good, clean, and smooth. I loved my Nexus 6 and the S7 Edge though, shoutout to Motorola and Samsung for making great phones! 

TouchID is a blessing in disguise. 
DICK = HARD
nah man, this is a *perfectly reasonable* request (mostly because I desperately want that Discovery LP2 haha)

/r/movies is a cesspool. They always try to deflect their sexism, racism, etc. as "legitimate criticism" when it's just a bunch of angry white boys upset that the opposite gender and other races want to have more representation in films. 
>I thought he was an arrogant asshole.  Then I saw how much hate he was getting from mainly white people of all ages and I realized my view of him was being painted through a white lens.

>Even if he is an ass sometimes (mostly just confident), I like him because he makes certain people (mainly white but older crusty black people as well) so angry just by doing what he enjoys in life and not giving a fuck about what anyone thinks.

That's what I love about him. He makes white people SO angry and it's hilarious. He's extremely confident and is completely aware of what he's doing, so any time anyone says they hate him, I know exactly why and laugh. 

I always say there's two types of people: those that hate Kanye and those that love Kanye.
I had to explain to people that the Kanye they see in the public is played up. Some people really just don't think the man can be a sane normal person.
I think it's more about the jump junkrat made to get there. I will now try and fail numerous times to recreate this jump next time I play.

Nice! I'm hoping to move closer into ATL after the new stadium gets built so I can go to more games and not have to bother with parking or MARTA.
Chargers and Bears are my favorite teams after the Falcons. LT is one of my favorite players of all-time and you can't go wrong with Felipe behind center!
Gotta love Baze! This dude is a good good man
Awesome! I was there this weekend and took a couple pictures with my friend against that wall!
Hell yes, 100%
Still a cop for me. Hope they not too much. Gotta wear that ATL pride on my sleeve and my feet b
I'm a Hawks fan second. Native Atlantan and Horford was my favorite Hawk. To see him go to their rival like that, the way he did, makes me sick. It's not a literal sickness if that's what you were concerned about though.
Makes me sick to my stomach 
Currently at work, argued with "friends" about this and found out what kind of people they really are. Haven't done much work today. I'm emotionally and mentally drained. I couldn't be more sick. 
Hmm!
Fair enough!
I'm highly doubtful. But the promise of 4K, could mean Fuji is taking video more seriously than before.
oh my god this is awful lmao
#anotherbrexit
Fuck yea!
could not stop laughing watching this match at work. England got absolutely bodied.
This is me now haha. Although, I don't feel like I over-saturate too much.
I have a T5i and personally, it's not a huge amount different than the T3i. The T5i has a touchscreen which is useful for auto-focusing during video and when selecting focus points in live view, 9 vs 1 AF points, and has a faster JPEG buffer by about 6 or 7 shots.

I'd say go with the T3i since you get all those great lenses and when you feel like you're ready, sell the T3i for a couple bucks towards your next body.
Saw these guys at Warped in 2012 when NFG, TBS, them, and some other band played the main stage. That was a great year for Warped. They killed their set, I got WYTTSY signed by the band, and walked with Ryan through the festival for a bit. 

I was upset the first hiatus and now I'm going to be incredibly sad since they're hanging up the towel.
I finally started editing photos in Lightroom and exported them and put them on Instagram! I've gotten great feedback so far from followers and friends and plan to upload more and more.

I'm hoping to upgrade my camera soon from a T5i either to the 5D Mark IV or Fuji X-T2 since I've been eyeing both their predecessors a lot recently. 

I also shot some photos for one of the executives at the company I'm working for, so hopefully, I'll be getting more work.
AS A CERTIFIED LEBRON HATER, I GOTTA SAY HE SAW, HE CAME, HE CONQUERED! CONGRATULATIONS CLEVELAND, Y'ALL DESERVE THIS VICTORY SO FUCKING MUCH!

GOD OF MOTHER FUCKING WAR!
I absolutely love Marrow
Just recommend their whole discography haha none of it is bad!
but why would I go out and make a difference like those participating in BLM and other advocacy groups when I can just get on reddit and try to call out the hypocrisy of BLM /s
I almost cried watching this trailer. Kingdom Hearts finally looks like the cutscenes and it's so beautiful! I'm so fucking hyped! Definitely gonna pick up a PS3 and the remixes plus this. 
Sony a7Rii, about 5 batteries, 35mm, 55mm, and 85mm. Might be more than $7000 but craigslist, ebay, and forums are my friends.
This is really fun and clever!
Yeah but that disclaimer wasn't added until after this crash. I used to use the filter a lot when I would bike around campus last year.
I like this. I've been getting really envious of some of the newer cameras that are way out of my price range and have a thousand and one features I don't need in particular. Yet, I keep going back to my T5i and love shooting with it. 

However, I wouldn't mind adding a Sony a7II to my arsenal. That 5-axis IBIS is pretty sweet.
Hey, if we're being honest, WW2 was the shit. My favorite war from a historical and entertainment standpoint.
The 5/5s line looks exactly the same as the 4/4s line just thinner and a bigger screen. The fuck are you talking about? The S4 looks nor feels anything like the S6. 
right? I was just using it to hook my MBP to my monitor less than an hour ago to do some video work
It's so effortlessly funny! One of my all-time favorite shows
Goddamnit this is fucking great lmao
Holy shit, that's impressive!
didn't they win like 100 games or some crazy shit like that?
I may know why but, ya know, it's not a popular opinion here
Savannah sucks ass. I'll give you NYC and Chicago tho. Love me some ChiTown deep dish pizza and NY hotdogs!
plz stop
It's my complaint too. Just makes no fucking sense
I agree with you but only this time
To be honest, I don't think anyone will say that the Warriors overextended themselves to break the record. The record was theirs to lose, imo. The last four games against the Spurs and Grizzlies aside from the first Grizzlies games wasn't really tough physically on any of the players. Everything was just clicking during the regular season.

In this series' case, I think OKC used those losses during the regular season and had the Warriors marked for the playoffs. They know what they did wrong to lose and they're playing against it now.
Spurs fan here and I have the most satisfying hard-on for you guys killing the Warriors! OKC has earned nothing but respect. Westbrook, KD, fucking Dion Waiters! 

Close out in Oakland, Thunder! 
FACTS! 
Tbh I figured it was a joke because Mutombo can't really be upset that someone else decided to wag their finger. It's not like he owns a trademark or copyright on finger wagging. 
Curry just gonna trip Westbrook and not get called tho?
JGL would be great especially with the Snowden movie coming out in either September or October 
This skit had me laughing so hard! I haven't laughed like that in a long long time. Probably one of my favorite SNL skits ever.
They sent it to promotions but I was told it would have to be applied manually by them so I'm assuming the discount will go through.
I just got it to work for me. Thanks for posting this because I had it ready if they tried to tell me otherwise lol
Chance bars in /r/nottheonion? Nice work
We're also using Lync. I had to tell people that had been working at my job before me that Lync is just Skype for Business. Literally, no one knew.
This is actually really neat! Glad he's enjoying himself and his decision.
This is great because I love Hall & Oates and would hate to dismiss them. Hall & Oates are clearly inspired by the sounds they heard growing up. I've never heard anything bad about either of them from black musicians.
On "Colossus" on Wolf he basically admits that.

THUNDER WIN? YUP!

did you really just spell 'bite' as 'bight'? lol
I'm just using stats and watching games as information just like you. If you think it's ridiculous that I see Ryan and Newton as interchangeable, so be it. Ryan has factors that Cam doesn't have as I've already discussed and vice-versa for Cam. Watching them both for the past 5 years, Cam has certainly come into his own, but he hasn't eclipsed Ryan yet. On his way, definitely. He's got another season to prove me wrong.
It's not worse logic because Matt Ryan, by nature, is a passer. Obviously, eliminating the only facet of his game would make him awful. You can argue that about Brady, Manning, Brees, any pocket QB. 

Just because Newton can scramble doesn't instantly make him a better QB than Ryan. That's my point. You wouldn't put Wilson over Brady just because he can scramble and Brady can't. Yes, Newton is a dual-threat, but nobody is fearing Cam passing on them as opposed to him running.

The Broncos D is amazing. They're the only elite defense the Panthers faced last season. That's not a question.

Newton's 45:10 season and over 4500 total yards last season was incredible and he's extremely talented - he's hitting his stride, but he's not the 2nd best QB in the South just based on the fact that he can run while Ryan can't. When you play shit defenses in the AFC and NFC South, anything is possible. Blaine Gabbert-led 49ers beat the Falcons.

If anything, Ryan and Cam are in a close (or interchangeable) 2 and 3 depending on who you talk to.

Of course, these are opinions because I'm not playing either of them so who the fuck cares what I think?

baby edit: I'm not trying to discredit Newton, btw. This is good discussion :) . Newton is a much better athlete than Ryan without question though. If the Falcons play a hard hitting defense, 7-10 times, I'd have Newton take those hits than Ryan because I know he'll pop right back up and probably bust them right back in the mouth.
With that logic, it sounds like you're making the argument that scrambling QBs are better than pocket QBs because they can run. If you eliminate the run, like we saw in the Super Bowl, Newton crumbles. 
Well that too :p
Passing into coverage, passing against blitzes, late 4th quarter drives, yardage, pocket presence. Newton is only better than. Ryan at scrambling and tossing less interceptions (at the expense that he throws considerably less). 

At no point has Newton ever been a better passer than Ryan - save for this past season. I went to high school with Newton and have followed him throughout and have been watching Ryan since he was drafted. If anything, after this season the Panthers had, Newton and Ryan are tied at 2nd best QBs in the South. 

Newton had one good season, let's not start crowning him because of recency bias. 
are you or have you ever been an undercover cop? No? shut the fuck up
With all due respect, you're crazy.
Like a less funny version of Scooter Macgruder's style... but he hasn't made a stuff falcons fans say yet so this will do
Winston is definitely not better than Ryan in any capacity except running. Newton had one good season. Ryan is easily 2nd best QB in the South.
It'll never end, mate
And that's crazy that KD will be treated that way. I'm hoping the Thunder beat the Warriors. 

To me, KD and Wes have arguably had he toughest challenge this entire playoffs. They had to play an average Mavs team that still kept it close in a few games, an all-time great Spurs team, and now the all-time best team in the Warriors. 

The Thunder are no slouch and the way that place is treating the Spurs is like they just lost in the second round to overachieving scrubs. 
Exactly. This is a 55-win 3rd seed that has two of the top 5 players in the game right now - both of whom are incredibly healthy as opposed to previous playoffs. 
That's not the point...
Well you see, logically, that makes complete sense. Anyone who thought the Spurs were gonna sweep or take it in 5 was naïve to say the least. But for /r/NBA, the Spurs are literally the worst team.
Very true to your first couple points. Some people the friendliness is more natural than others. 

There's another thread where Pop gives a sarcastic remarks, but someone provided a video of the remark and he was having fun with it. It comes and goes with him, I guess :p
Right? It's a tough crowd in there, man. 
I saw that lol I was just like are you fucking serious
I'm definitely just going to go for the news, won't dive into the comments
So true. I've mostly given up commenting on Reddit aside from a few specific discussion-based places and game threads.
I can totally understand that. But the way I see it, it's the same with Belichick and Marshawn Lynch. If he doesn't want to talk to the media, he can give them any answer he pleases since he has to be there. He is not required to answer their questions with the answer they want to hear. 

But I do understand the reaction.
Film and video production! The industry here started booming at the right time! You?
Gotta respect your hustle man, haha! 
Aside from game threads, I tend to rarely stick around for post-game posts because of how reactionary everything is in here. There's no real discussion. If you don't agree with the hivemind at the time, you're going to get downvoted. It's pretty dumb really. 
He did let down "everybody" though which if you ask me is pretty damn inconsiderate! 

/s
What an asshole letting everybody down like that! 


/s
I'll take notice of her when Draymond has won five championships and is considered one of the best of all-time. Until then, #putaforkinit
Ho boy, you should check out the other thread about another one of his quotes. People are mad lol
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I think it's pretty funny tbh
Me and a buddy had his discussion yesterday lol. He was in favor of hockey coming back and I told him it could come back if the team isn't ass like the Thrashers were. 
I guess. But expecting him to change after being this particular way for 20 years is foolish. Don't like? Don't pay attention to it.
shh, you're getting downvoted because people don't like Pop being a meanie to the media
There's that too
Thunder in 6. No way KD, Westbrook, and the Gang lose this series after getting swept during the regular season in incredibly close games. With the emergence of Kanter and Adams, rebounding will be the biggest factor alongside KD and Westbrook balling out each game. 
Crazy how the outcome of a series affects the hivemind opinion of the Spurclejerk. We might not ever return to a positive 'jerk lmao
But he doesn't have to stop being one either just because you don't like it. Idk why people are surprised by this. Pop's been like this after critical losses for years. 
Because everybody that didn't win is going to be hungry... I mean will they all play like it? Nah, but as fans, we gotta believe 
Lmao fuck, I may be hurting, but I understand 
damn son, where'd u get those legs boi? doughboy outfitters? 

(jk great fit m8, luv atl groupme)
Not like this Spurs, not like this :( OKC vs. Warriors will be nice tho
It's probably cheaper than hiring voice actors to do VOa for every langue that game gets translated to. Still doesn't mean they intend for it to be read all the way through though.
Those student loans are no joke :p
Yeah I just graduated so I'm staying with my folks for now but when I move closer in the city, I'll be relying in Marta a lot
Fucking perfect! I've been looking into getting a 3DS to get back into Pokémon for Sun and Moon and this price drop is just what I needed to buy a DS and get all the Pokémon games I want in preparation. 
I'm out in Conyers making that 1hour-1hour30 commute every morning and evening, haha.
Okay mate. You're right. Everyone but you is missing what he's really saying. 

I work in Buckhead and love living OTP. I go to downtown every day and if I'm feeling good, I might stroll through the city on a Saturday or two. Money is no issue. 

OTP vs ITP is the dumbest "fight" anyone can be a part of.
Seeing as how you're being willfully ignorant of Parker's quote, that makes you stupid. 

Also, I live OTP and cannot give two fucks about whether or not Marta goes to Cobb. I have no business in Cobb. Marta goes everywhere I need it to go. So good job on that one, mate. You failed again.
You're either really fucking dense or really fucking stupid. I'm afraid I can't tell.
That's not what he said at all. Did you even read the article? 

> "we think we are a formidable and good business partner, and a good investment and if you don’t think the same then we’ll wait until you change your mind or we’ll go elsewhere."

can you read or not?
