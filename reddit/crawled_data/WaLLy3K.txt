For Windows 8:

* [Destroy Windows Spying](https://github.com/Nummer/Destroy-Windows-10-Spying)
* [Disable Teredo](https://lonesysadmin.net/2011/04/25/how-to-disable-teredo-ipv6-tunneling-in-microsoft-windows/)

That's what I use to stop W8.1 phoning home.
Things that still give me great joy:

**Statistics**: for a system (DNS) that's otherwise completely invisible to the end user. Being able to see how many trackers have been blocked from mobile apps or what services your IoT devices connect to, and just the fact FTL is a stats haven. I adore FTL, because it means I can write scripts such as being able to send a weekly message via [Pushover](https://pushover.net) showing what my top 20 permitted domains were.

**Blocked Domains**: 8.8K suspicious/advertising/tracking/telemetry/malicious domains are blocked by my lists and a further 1.76M are related to pornography. Considering that childhood education is focusing a lot on the Internet these days, it's *easy* to mis-click and your child finding themselves somewhere unrelated to their original purpose. Knowing all that content is blocked is instant peace-of-mind!

**In-app content blocking**: Users will be delighted to see that ads have been removed from their free mobile games, smart TV, or from some of their online streaming sites (obviously, not YouTube, sadly)

**Data quotas last longer**: With 20Mb, you can read [one news article with ads, or five without](https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/913918850508382208)

**Website Responsiveness**: The web will undeniably feel "more snappy". If you're browsing sites you don't usually browse to, are you really going to wait 10+ seconds for it to load? Probably not, if you're used to 2 seconds!

I suppose there's more aspects that one can appreciate, but that's all I can think of right now! :)
You can set up a dynamic DNS service via Cloudflare, DuckDNS or NoIP.

I use Cloudflare, and run an OpenVPN server from home.
It’s all about providing users options. If they want to use Google or Cloudflare as their upstream resolvers, then that’s their issue — especially if you’re in somewhere like Turkey which is known to block access to social media.
In the world of coding, a “fork” means that it uses the existing codebase of Project A, typically adds a few things here and there, and becomes Project B.

FTLDNS *is* a fork of `dnsmasq`, which means you’ll no longer need to run `dnsmasq` on your system as it’s all integrated into FTLDNS.
It’s not very nice, honestly. You can use `pihole -q -adlist domain.com` to get usable results, but that’s from the Terminal and not the Web Interface.
Out of genuine interest: how likely may it have been that the admins at that forum removed your posts due to inflammatory language (as evident by your blog post) rather than the message you were trying to portray?
This notice should be at the top of the page, not a hyperlink to this text at the bottom.
^(You’d think that’d be evident by the fact the first word you said was g’day, but) ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I’m just amused that Brazil was the assumed country!
I heard Dell are explosively good.
"It's those dang android auto diallers attacking our lines"
"Nah mate the product number, not the *serial* number"
If you’ve got Chad’s blocklist and sites via HTTPS aren’t being blocked, look into your DNS settings and make sure you’re only pointing clients to the Pi-hole. Often, setting a secondary server (to an upstream provider like Google or OpenDNS) can bypass filtering.
Pi-hole doesn’t host any blocklists, however I do on `v.firebog.net`. Even then, [the useful stats I get](https://twitter.com/WaLLy3K/status/982957896240517125) only include power users that opt into using my lists.

As /u/dschaper said, that’s also assuming that those lists are *only* used by Pi-hole users. In the end, they’re only indicative of general growth rather than install base.
As a Pi-hole developer, I’d recommend it to cover all the devices on your network, and then the likes of uBlock Origin to clean up the blank space that sites often leave.

Definitely nothing wrong with both!
“Pinhole”, hah, the autocorrect struggle is real!

Use a non-standard port (so it’s not obvious what it is *if* you get port scanned) and follow [the OpenVPN hardening guide](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Hardening).
Tomato is basically dead, since Shibby doesn’t have the time to dedicate to it any more. LEDE and any post-LEDE merges for OpenWRT are worth following up on.

The [Turris MOX](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/turris-mox-modular-open-source-router-security-computers#/) (a modular router being funded at Indiegogo, as a cheaper alternative to the [Omnia](https://omnia.turris.cz/)) looks to be a solid contender in the open source and open hardware space!
This is a very elegant reply, so take my upvote.

We understand that not everyone can (or wants to) donate, and that’s totally okay - spreading the word of Pi-hole also helps us.
(ง’̀-‘́)ง
We gotta make sure you guys *don’t* get to bug city! (Thanks autocorrect for assuming I meant to say “big”...)
Yes, it contains the default block lists. It doesn’t explicitly contain Steven Black’s hosts, but contains the sources that his list consolidates.
Dark Sky isn’t very accurate in some countries - in my case, Australia - so Weather Underground is a far more accurate data source as it sources data from Personal Weather Stations that have been configured to submit data to WU.

I *utterly loathe* paying for subscriptions, but my desire to support Carrot Weather and its developer manages to override that.
Try disabling WiFi power saving: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/34794/how-to-disable-wi-fi-dongle-sleep-mode#34952
Ethernet or WiFi? Static IP or dynamic?
TLS can be enabled for the Web Interface without affecting blocked pages, and won’t be overwritten by updates: https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/enabling-https-for-your-pi-hole-web-interface/5771

As for having a block page for HTTPS pages, it’s not something we’re looking into at this time :)
So a bit like a heartbeat, hey?
If you use `dnsmasq` as your DHCP solution, there’s functionality called `—dhcp-script` which can be used to call functions upon a new MAC being served an IP address. I have it set so anything that’s not a static IP will provide me a notification via Pushover.
Why has installing `samba` installed `nginx`...?
Of course it can. What makes FOSS important is that it *can* be scrutinised.
It's a fair point. Some people simply don't have the liberty of moving off Windows, and there's just so much stuff you need to do to feel you have a sense of privacy.

Being someone who primarily uses their fairly high end gaming PC as their daily driver, I'm obviously pretty stuck on Windows. So, I choose to use Windows 8.1 instead of W10, because at least it wasn't a telemetry laden crap-fest when it was released. So, these are the things I take into consideration:

* Remove telemetry updates. [Destroy Windows 10 Spying](https://github.com/Nummer/Destroy-Windows-10-Spying) is quite possibly the best tool I've seen which removes specific updates, uses the Windows firewall to block Microsoft IP's, and removes scheduled tasks
* [Disable Teredo](https://lonesysadmin.net/2011/04/25/how-to-disable-teredo-ipv6-tunneling-in-microsoft-windows/), which causes a *ton* of outbound DNS calls to Microsoft
* [Disable Nvidia telemetry](https://github.com/NateShoffner/Disable-Nvidia-Telemetry), if you're on the Green Team
* Running [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net), specifically with [Windows Spy Blocking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker/master/data/hosts/win10/spy.txt) lists
* Assigning static IP's and disabling DHCP (or using `dnsmasq`'s [dhcp-script](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html) functionality to alert you to unknown MAC's being leased). Why? Intel ME supposedly [has its own MAC and IP address for the out-of-band interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Active_Management_Technology#design), so `dnsmasq` built into Pi-hole should in theory detect any instances of IME being activated on my network
* DHCP ensures that all clients will use Pi-hole, but some things are known to manually specify their own DNS servers... so I ensure to redirect Port 53 to my Pi-hole via my routers `iptables`

When someone has to go to *all that trouble* to ~~play some god damn Steam games~~ use Windows, no wonder the suggestion here is "just use Linux".
There's Microsoft IP lists that would serve you well to block too. Combine that with [non-standard Pi-hole block lists](https://wally3k.github.io) and there's a fair chance you'll be able to block a large amount of mothership telemetry.
OpenVPN should be pretty much the only service that should be open to the outside world on a home network.

Make sure you change the port and [follow these hardening tips](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Hardening)
and barf, because it's not like I'm putting that in the bin.
On the bottom in the four corners - they're feet, to stop the case from scratching the surface of whatever it lays on.
Ensuring you get notified of changes as your ad lists are updated is pretty clever! :)

Thanks for the support too, it’s definitely appreciated.
> Add a shebang to your script so you know it's running with the correct shell.

Absolutely. The difference between how `#!/bin/sh` and `#!/bin/bash` interprets a script can be staggering.

I'd recommend running any scripts you create through [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) and taking its suggestions onboard.
That link was added three days ago, so I’m surprised anyone noticed it was there :)
The standalone version of 1Password is pretty fantastic (even if 1PW4, the last vault supported version on Windows is *dated*), and the fact that I can access my vaults from my local NAS (on the desktop clients) means I have control over the storage *and* transport of my data.

It's been good to me for three years now, but since they've switched to a cloud-based solution, I'd investigate Bitwarden if I had a do-over.
Checking it from Safari on iOS, it’s definitely a lot faster and usable now! There is some slowdown involving redirecting qkly links to tspprs though.

I’d suggest that with the lists, you serve a plaintext version instead of what you currently have with borders around each domain. That’d make it easier to integrate into Pi-hole :)

That’s the article that helped me get set up, when I didn’t know anything about it! :)
The Rock64 makes for a really nice single disk NAS, thanks to the GbE and single USB3 port. It's what I'm using at home.
They need to stack the bins that way in order to cover the pot holes.
If you’re using LUKS, you have eight key slots you can use. Slot 0 should probably be a PIN that’s either stored in your password manager or YubiKey, and Slot 1 can be a key file so that the system can automatically unlock the drive.

That way, you greatly minimise the risk of forgetting or losing access to any of the key slots, preventing access to the drive.
Honestly, it's fascinating to see such an intricate breakdown count per category -- I love it! :)

Browsing the site is a little bit frustrating due to page load speeds (one page took 13 seconds to generate!), but that's the only criticism I have.
Hmm, I guess I've never thought about that - I do only use fingerprint to unlock, unless I'm travelling.

> I’d be willing to donate via patreon or similar offering that’s recurring, not for a reward but because I wouldn’t need to think about it and it be a platform to have tiers, but of course they take a % and it’d be something else someone has to update.

There is the option to set a [monthly donation via Paypal](https://pi-hole.net/donate/), for what it's worth! :)
Nothing is set in stone (let alone in sand!), we just want to gauge users perceptions on the project in different areas, including monetary.
I keep every TOTP on my Yubikey, and keep my two most used ones on my mobile.
I used to use my router, and found it end up killing the internet connection after adding 400k+ domains, so I eventually end up using Pi-hole and found it much easier to use.
I also try and keep on top of false positives reported to me, by forwarding them to the specific block list maintainer :)
Have an iPhone and a Mac? [Pair lock your device](https://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=2589) to prevent this from happening to you.

They’re a solid unit at a fantastic price point. Would recommend.
I use Ayufan’s Debian builds and while there were a few teething USB3 drive swapping issues, they’ve since been fixed. I use my R64 as my daily driver and development box.

LUKS encrypted 250Gb SSD connected via USB3 fully saturates the GbE link when using Samba.
You can use something like empty toilet rolls to group up the cables for easy storage.

[This what my storage boxes look like](https://imgur.com/a/7FAk0)!
On the secure vault. Bank apps on my phone rarely ever log out, so the login doesn’t need to stay on device.
Apple aren’t going to sell your iCloud data, but most of it is still “[warrant friendly](https://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=5900)”. Assuming your threat model doesn’t involve state actors, it’s a perfectly acceptable setup for most.
I use 1Password with two local vaults, which are never stored on the cloud.

The everyday one has ten accounts: social media, email, and a couple of other accounts that I’m likely to want to access while out on my phone. Due to a lack of 2FA tokens, it won’t compromise my accounts if the device is lost, hacked or forced open against my will.

The secure one includes every bit of relevant account security information, can only be accessed from my laptop or PC when connected to my LAN and requires my Yubikey for login.
The AppleID popup prompt is a big reason I implemented two password vaults: an everyday "mobile/travel friendly" vault with passwords that can be remembered *if* regularly used, and a secure vault with long secure random generated passwords that can only be accessed on certain devices with specific restrictions.

For some things, it isn't practical to use a secure generated password.
Hosts files don’t, but [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) does! :)
There’s two solutions for network wide ad-blocking:

* Pi-hole, as you’ve said as it uses a local DNS server
* Privoxy, which uses a HTTP proxy (though you’d need to redirect Port 80 silently on your Router to go through the proxy)

They’re the only two methods I’m aware of.
If you're still using the local vault 1Password solution, it's fantastic. For new users, [BitWarden on your own server](https://bitwarden.com) perhaps?
There was a guy working on Pi-hole YouTube block lists, but he gave up and [end up using this](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71133073&postcount=3) on his Android device.

I don't know of any iOS solution, sadly.
Yeah, [ayufan builds](https://github.com/ayufan-rock64/linux-build/releases) are Debian.

While I wish it had two USB3 ports on it, it’s definitely fantastic for the price and power consumption.
If you're wanting to remove ads on YouTube, router-based adblocking and Pi-hole won't solve the issue for you.
The Rock64 has GbE, USB3 and still manages to be $25, so I don't necessarily buy the "keeping the cost low" argument.
If you're buying new, it's a fine purchase. If you're thinking of upgrading from a 3B, you're better off buying a USB3 GbE adaptor.

https://imgur.com/2ECDD08
Yep, take it from a Pi-hole dev: blocking YouTube ads at the DNS level is *not* effective. Go with a browser-based adblocker such as uBlock Origin instead.
The Rock64 is my daily driver SBC, and makes for a brilliant single-disk NAS :)
My point was the article poorly presented both sides. Aside from what felt like some cheap political sound bytes from MT and a statement thrown in from the Strategic Policy Institute, I felt like the article was simply alluding to the reasoning being pork barrelling.
Thank you, this is much better justification than the article gave.
The point of having the empty car factories ready to go seems like a damn fair point, so what possible justification do they have for why the heck Ipswich got it instead? If you go by the article where it starts to chop, change and conflate the point, it remains unclear (at least to me).
> I tell the girl this and she advises me that she'll pass on feedback to the Narangba sorting station. Feedback that will probably never be actioned, as parcels will continue to be left under people's cars or in stupid places where they get stolen.

On the flip side: if you've got a really nice courier, call up and give them a compliment. They'll hear the feedback directly, and it'll literally make their entire week better given how *no one* calls to compliment them. I've got an absolutely amazing courier now (after my complaint end up getting the last card-and-ditcher fired) and this big older burly man almost broke down in tears of happiness when he delivered our next parcel.

Stuff like this is not uncommon, and this quote comes to mind:

> [@Pinboard](https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/913918850508382208):

I've only ever had that on sites like Gizmodo, because a lot of their content is hosted by `alluremedia.com.au` which I've seen blocked by more obscure blocklists, and I work with ad-blocking blocklists daily.
I’ve been using it for the better part of 2017, and there’s been no issues! :)
AFAIK, it means webmasters haven't bothered to add DNSSEC records for their domain. Head to something like https://cloudflare.com (or even my own personal site https://firebog.net), and it'll show up as secure.
If you set up an OpenVPN connection on your Pi-hole server (you can have it only route DNS/LAN queries, which makes it quite usable on connections with <1Mbps upload) you can be protected while out and about.
I can't say I've experienced it first hand (I keep IoT and "smart" stuff to a minimum) but as a Pi-hole dev, I *have* heard of it.

It's also not necessarily the advertisers fault, it's "smart makers" who want to continue making profit after purchase.
It's a solid first line of defense on your network, as it blocks domains at the DNS level - so for example, you won't get ads on the dashboard of your Smart TV. You can then use browser-based adblockers like uBlock Origin to cosmetically remove the spaces left behind.
You get a feel for what scripts you need to run (e.g: CDN's with a similar looking name to the first-party site you're visiting, or the jibberish domains hosted at CloudFront), and as long as they're enabled, the site works perfectly fine.

Between that and a large Pi-hole blocklist, I'm not concerned of my P.I. being swept up by session replay scripts.
Please remove `https://openphish.com/feed.txt` from your blocklist. It used to be in a domains-only format, but is now in a URL format which is **not compatible with Pi-hole**.
Fair call!
They insist that they don't want a back door, and point to the U.K's "technical capability notice" where readable data has to be provided where it is "proportionate, technically feasible and reasonably practicable".

So basically, **absolutely not** technically feasible when utilising End to End encryption, meaning it can't touch Signal, WhatsApp, as well as probably Telegram and Wickr.

> One of the ways that people say you could get past encryption without the need to break it would be to specifically target certain devices with software updates so law enforcement can see the communication when it is decrypted.

That's going to be a great way to know you're being targeted - your iPhone says you've got an iOS update available, yet [ipsw.me](https://ipsw.me) shows no new update. Yeah, that'll go down *juuuuuuuuust* nicely... I'm sure.

Any other "software updates" not provided by say, Apple, and you're literally talking about installing spyware on the device which has absolutely nothing to do with breaking encryption and is [already a massive industry](https://www.cnet.com/news/another-company-claims-it-can-break-into-your-iphone-x/).

They seem pretty cool - you can enable Gigabit for a single day (e.g: First-time monstrous cloud backup), and go back to the speeds you normally require.
I feel pretty similar - I like to be able to reply to things very promptly if someone messages me, and having notifications on my wrist has allowed me to become untethered from my phone and computer.

A bonus to this means that I’m less inclined to retrieve my phone and waste time on it.

Each to their own, of course.
This is what **always** bugged me about the first few seasons of Elementary, before they bothered to start mixing it up.
> the watch assumes that the bluetooth connection to my phone (in a locker) is the best method to connect, but it's so far away that nothing sends, streams, etc.

I have this every damn day when I head out to the backyard and leave my phone inside. It needs to be able to detect that the BT signal is so poor, that it's practically worthless.

You try to use Siri in this circumstance, and the watch will state "Neither the Apple Watch nor iPhone can access Siri", which is crap because the watch has both great WiFi signal, and access via LTE.
Big Data is everywhere, can be monetised in ways you haven't considered and isn't isolated to just big tech companies.
Heh, I dunno... I feel my FTTP isn't seriously flawed :)

(But that's probably the *only* thing that isn't, to be fair...)
Just a basic [Arlec PC222](https://www.bunnings.com.au/arlec-energy-cost-electrical-meter_p4410270), which I can then calculate the cost per day/month/year via [this page](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/electric/electricity-calculator.html).
I like to read my individual appliance usage, and take a keen interest to the power meter - so I was pretty interested when I was recently offered to have a "Smart Meter" installed at my place. After having it installed, I inquired if there were any abilities for *me* to have online access to the readings. Nope, nothing - not even an API.

Since I can easily manually read the usage now (the screen was pretty busted on the old thing we had), I end up making a spreadsheet that calculates my per-day usage and total bills - it was genuinely interesting to see that the oven usage was taking up 2 of my 5kWh's daily usage. 

Having easy app-like access is definitely something that everyday users can benefit from, I reckon.
> Your best bet is to run a pi-hole on your own network, with your own equipment, which you control, and then VPN your phone to that. Same effect, but because you control the hardware and software it is much more secure.

Absolutely. Pi-hole for your DNS resolution and OpenVPN [only routing DNS queries](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/OpenVPN-server:-Only-route-DNS-via-VPN) means you can run DNS filtering on all your cellular devices, even if you have a <1Mbit upload.

As a Pi-hole developer, I can assure you that we're very forthright with any privacy and security concerns put to us. :)

"Founders edition", formally known as "reference edition" cards started being sold by Nvidia when the 1070/1080's were released in 2016.

For a case where you want minimal whitelisting, don’t add General/Suspicious lists - just specific categories only.

**Absolutely, this**, /u/That_Guuuuuuuy. Reframe the argument they're making to focus on the facts:

* The **sole** issue here is that you're experiencing 2-6 dropouts a day, which is not acceptable and should be resolved ASAP
* If there was an issue with "illegal torrents", you'd be getting served with an infringement letter (which, obviously, you have not been. End of argument.)
* Uploads are being used for legitimate purposes such as the creation of YT content, gaming, and cloud backups
* Any other arguments from Telstra focusing on deferring the line fault as upload issues are unfounded and unreasonable arguments; if they persist, you'll have your parents take the case up with the TIO.
> OP suggested spinning up a whole second instance just so he could get around his router wanting two DNS servers.

A totally valid solution.

> Others have jumped in drumming up this idea that you need to have two for it to work reliably.

Which is why I'm pointing out that the software *is* reliable, unless you're experiencing one of the few circumstances where it won't work :)

There's a difference between "sometimes it doesn't work" (alluding to a potential intermittent unreliability) and "there are circumstances where it *won't* work". For people that are concerned about redundancy, it's good to know what those circumstances are.
There are enough reasons to warrant 100% Pi-hole DNS resolvability. The first one could be uncontactable due to:

* Hardware issues (e.g: SD card failure)
* Resolver is starting, or rebooting
* Blocklists have *just* been updated (e.g: Gravity update, whitelisting, blacklisting and wildcards)

It isn’t so critical at home, but if you’re supporting more than 3 active users, it’s definitely worth considering.
Honestly, that kit sounds like a lot of fun to be walking around with!
Perfect answer.
If you only use PayPal via a regular web browser, this will work fine. If you use the PayPal app via iOS (and presumably via Android too), you'll be told that you can't use the TOTP authentication method, and that you still need to tie a mobile number to the account in order to get 2FA codes.

What a joke :(
I can totally respect that all of that! :)
Bit disappointed that it only covers browser based adblockers, and not other types.

As a dev of the project, I’m a bit biased towards the open-source network wide adblocker /r/pihole, but there’s other similar DNS based utilities one can use too.
You can also add more metrics using the watch app, and it can scroll down if you add more than five.
I run a 50Mbps connection + OpenVPN on my router (Asus RT-AC68U with Merlin Firmware) and don't have any issues with WAN transfer speeds, and from what I've heard on the Tomato forums, it should be able to handle 200Mbps WAN fairly easily. With OpenVPN, I only run a server to route DNS queries from my cellular devices though.

You could always go for a cheaper router that allows third party firmware (Read: DD-WRT, Shibby/Toastman Tomato or LEDE) and get a Raspberry Pi style SBC to handle your VPN tunnel.
I don't have a list specific to phishing - it'd be better for everyone if you were to [submit them here](https://forum.hosts-file.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=5287) as many people use hpHosts phishing lists.
It only goes through if your Router supports IPv6 via WAN, AFAIK.
There’s [seven of us](https://github.com/orgs/pi-hole/people) who all contribute to different areas of the project in our spare time! :)
There is a seperate list in the other category which has far more extensive coverage of crypto currency mining sites. 🙂
As I understand it, /u/itsjero wants an option that allows whitelisting without a password, but still have a password for the Web Interface.

Might be best to remove the Web Interface password, and put a `.htaccess`-like password on the `/var/www/admin` folder.
The 2016 TV series was pretty damn good, but there's no news about a Season 2 AFAIK.
It’s not something that can be installed onto your Pi-hole setup just yet. /cc /u/DarthKeizer 
/r/MisleadingThumbnails 
It’s possible you’ve got another list making up the extra 2.4M~, but hey, no judgements here!
This is correct.
Everything with a tick totals in at about 1M. Any time I see 2.2M+, I presume they’ve added the anti-porn lists too (which aren’t ticked :))
The teething issues can be a pain in the backside at first while you’re determining what should be whitelisted, so try running it for yourself and perhaps do a one person at a time opt-in process?
That’s the main reason that I made the instructions for the alternative install instructions as prominent as the primary install method on GitHub.

Haven’t had time to do it for the website though!
Absolutely! A portion (in my experience of a primarily Mac/iOS household running Pi-hole, about 10%) of requests will go through the secondary. If you're concerned about 100% DNS resolution, then run a secondary Pi-hole server on something like a Pi Zero.

Just remember to copy your blocklists and whitelists over occasionally!
Just as long as it doesn’t have `ipv6` in the domain - that’s just teredo, which can be disabled!
It doesn’t need a Raspberry Pi, it can run on any modern Linux distro. Though, a SBC (like the RPi) is a cheap always-on server!
Missed a good pun with “It’s not much, but it’s dime” :P
The couriers? Definitely put in a complaint at 137678 - have a consignment ID handy, so they know who to tell off.
The Yubico Authenticator supports Steam's 2FA, as long as you get your secret via the likes of [WinAuth](https://github.com/winauth/winauth). Unfortunately, this can be restricting if you use the Steam Marketplace.
Blocking access to Google's DNS servers is overkill, I'd recommend [trying this workaround instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/7s82zs/dnsbased_ad_blockers_are_broken_on_latest_chrome/dt3kwmh/).

    wget -sO - https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick | sudo tee /etc/pihole/adlists.list

Since cron tools can differ between distributions, you should work out the syntax that works for you. :)
Personally, I have this on my router - it ensures everything after 10.0.0.5 forwards to my Pi-hole, while everything before can use any resolver (i.e: My router and SBC's).

    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp ! -i "ppp0" -m iprange ! --src-range "10.0.0.1"-"10.0.0.4" ! --dst-range "10.0.0.2"-"10.0.0.3" --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination "10.0.0.2"
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp ! -i "ppp0" -m iprange ! --src-range "10.0.0.1"-"10.0.0.4" ! --dst-range "10.0.0.2"-"10.0.0.3" --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination "10.0.0.2"
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE

My `iptables` experience isn't very good, but I understand the following:

*  `! -i "ppp0"` excludes my routers WAN interface (which prevents me from becoming an open resolver)
* `-m iprange ! --src-range "10.0.0.1"-"10.0.0.4"` excludes a range of IP addresses from having their DNS queries redirected
* `! --dst-range "10.0.0.1"-"10.0.0.4"` ensures that any DNS query not matching this IP is forwarded to `--dport 53 --to-destination "10.0.0.2"`
* `iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE` ensures that this redirection is done seamlessly

In my experience, I haven't seen this - it's often people wanting to "weed out" the less experienced so they can have a better shot at the chicken.
First I’ve heard of it! Submitting bug reports on GitHub is the best way to ensure it gets attention. Posts on social media can get missed *very* easily.

But muh precious driveways and gardens that need to get dug up for new conduits! ^/s
You’re going to have to 😜 NGA is still in early development, with /u/Mcat12 working on it in his spare time!
Its something we’ve discussed including with the Next Generation Admin Interface in some shape or form 🙂
I feel you. When I was doing Pi-hole breaking development (the recent `gravity.sh` changes), I’d have to run a seperate development unit just to ensure the live Pi-hole was still active at home - after having not seen ads for so long, I think the S.O would spit chips if ads suddenly appeared because I was ~~working on~~ breaking something 😆
We’ve discussed this internally a few times, but ultimately decided that:

1.	We don’t actually need to know the information in order to continue development, it’s just “nice to know”
2.	Storing it in a way that complies with data/privacy legislations worldwide is more trouble than it’s worth
3.	It would be yet another cost of a running server that we’d need to cover
It’ll still be necessary for the Block Page, so don’t worry :)
Most aren’t able to detect Pi-hole, as they’re just checking for browser based ad-blockers using JavaScript. Sometimes, a utility like ScriptSafe or NoScript can block these scripts from loading, but it doesn’t work in every case.

I know only of one site (MacOS on PC hardware related) where I can’t bypass the Adblock protections in place.
If more people did this, we’d never have to worry about covering server costs! 🙂
I remember reading that quote in the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson, so I guess Steve must have incorrectly attributed the quote then.
> They said the only people that want fast internet are nerds and gamers. Now they complain about struggling to watch netflix in peak usage time.

There's a great quote by Henry Ford. He said, "If I'd have asked my customers what they wanted, they would have told me 'A faster horse.'"

FTTN is the faster horse, where as FTTP is the automobile.
The interface was set to `tun0`, which would explain why it'd work after reconfiguring - `dnsmasq` didn't know which network adaptor to listen for queries on.
There's not a whole lot that I know of. Feel free to shoot me any links that seemingly defeat Pi-hole, and I'll see what I can do.
My opinion being a PH developer might be a bit biased, but I think /r/pihole is much better than running a Router based solution.
It can, but it's not as easy as one would expect when ad-serving domains are very similar to content-hosting domains.

[This blocklist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/adac7982307fec6ee23605e281a57f1a/raw/5b8582b906a9497624c3f3187a49ebc23a9cf2fb/Test.txt) blocks some of YT's ads, but not all of them.
Basically: it turned out that there were no great advantages to using `python` over `bash`.
Depends what language it’s in (I’m a bit limited since I only really know `bash` and `php`) who wrote it, if it’s properly indented, has legible function names and is commented well.

Usually, that means I can only understand the crap that I wrote :P

It took me almost an entire day to completely dissect and understand `gravity.sh`, in order to figure out what the heck it was doing and slowly improve little bits at a time!

The only site that I can reproduce getting blocked on (with [all my blocklists](https://wally3k.github.io)) is `blockadblock.com`. I made sure to clear my browser cache, and disable uBO.

With BAB, I seem to have success bypassing it by wildcard blocking `bannertrack.net` and `adtrackers.net`, so I've added the domains I spotted to [my personal blacklist](https://v.firebog.net/hosts/static/w3kbl.txt) which anyone [using my tick lists](https://wally3k.github.io) will get the next time `pihole -g` runs.
> I sent a PM here on Reddit on Oct 21.

Damn, sorry about that! I've removed this site from my personal blacklist, and updated the Cloudflare cache to reflect this update.
When was this? I don’t recall any issues being raised about this site, but I can remove it if I have some spare time later today.

Been super busy lately, so I might have seen the message and forgot to follow up on it!
> I'm with Internode which is for all intents and purposes the same as iiNet

Not really. Internode ensure that their POI's have adequate bandwidth during the evening. From everything I've read about iiNet, they don't bother with this at all.
With the improvements made in v3.2, this option is probably the best bet!
I had it on, but I had disabled “Setting Time Zone” in Location Services. Toggling after enabling that fixed it! Thanks.
It’s a reference to the phrase used in Westwood, for those who aren’t aware.
The amount O.P is blocking sounds just fine, and is roughly all the tick lists on https://wally3k.github.io

I'd suggest sticking under 1 million blocked sites on RPi like hardware, as whitelisting and blacklisting can cause DNS resolution to fail for other clients on your network while `dnsmasq` reads all your blocklists.

On VPS type hardware with SSD's, go nuts.
Fixed, thanks. Missed a `&&`
It’s a feature I desperately love (so does the S.O, admittedly), so it’s something I’m keeping in mind for a future release :)
The functionality that classified what list is what category is the function lost, as its too hard (right now, due to time constraints) to implement a “classification file” that is user-controlled rather than one maintained by us.

Manually blacklisted and wildcard blocked sites still show a reason for being blocked however :)
About 95% of its functionality has made it into the current release :)
Please delete my custom block page, as it’s no longer supported with v3.2. Uninstall instructions are on my repo at https://github.com/WaLLy3K/Pi-hole-Block-Page

You should get yourself a Pi-hole! https://pi-hole.net 
I gotta admit, I balked at the price for a long time - doubly so because background complication updates are a subscription (and I *hate* paying subscriptions *for anything*!).

Despite this, I took a plunge. Paid for the app and went for a one month premium subscription to get Weather Underground background updates as a complication. If I didn't like it (e.g: didn't have accurate weather for my area), I would have just got a refund.

I'm really loving having detailed complications on my primary modular watch face. In the large slot, I have the temperature and UV index. For small slot 1, I have Cloud Cover. For small slot 2, I have Wind Speed & Direction (which you can get if anyone in your family owns Carrot Fit, and you've downloaded it). As a person who's often keeping an eye on the weather for various reasons, the level of customisation it provides is definitely worth it.

The developer is responsive too, which is always a good thing.
I've only seen a difference on the first secret location.
Remove `/var/www/html/index.php` (the block page) as it’s superseded now :)
You can as long as you have a dynamic DNS entry set up for your IP address - I do this with Let’s Encrypt.
I use DietPi which sorts everything out for me automatically, but wrote the tut on a stock Raspbian install. So I guess I haven’t thought that far!

For those of you keen to enable HTTPS on your Web Interface, we have [a new FAQ](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/enabling-https-for-your-pi-hole-web-interface/5771) that should get you started!
I never claimed as such.
If you run [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net), you can see loads of ad queries get blocked from all the various apps you run. It doesn’t need to be much (a few kilobytes here, a megabyte there), but it’s prized information for these companies dealing in tracking and telemetry.
Huh, that’s probably why there’s so few good AU weather apps 😟

I appreciate the look into it though!
I’ve been trying WU as per a discussion we had on Twitter, and it’s pretty neat having hyper local weather station accuracy (even if I’m not a big fan of their iPhone/AW apps). It’s disappointing that if I buy Carrot Weather (which this update is making me strongly consider), that it basically ensures I have to pay a premium subscription.

I’d be totally happy Aussies could source their weather from BOM, and WU as a premium!
Browsing around a couple of streams right now, and I can't seem to reproduce any ads with or without Scriptsafe enabled.

I see the following blocked by Pi-hole: `client-event-reporter.twitch.tv`, `pubster.twitch.tv` and `imasdk.googleapis.com`
Updated, thanks!
uBlock is still useful because it collapses the ad windows on the screen, while Pi-hole ensures that the vast majority of ads are blocked on all your household devices.

> So what is the ttl of non-blacklisted domains?

Whatever the domain sets as default - `dnsmasq` and by extension, Pi-hole, has no say over that.
It was between [this PR](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/pull/1698#issuecomment-331134576) and some internal discussion that DL6ER and I decided that it was good to have some caching, but still have DHCP and whitelisting/blacklisting be quick and effective.
The TTL of *blacklisted* DNS records. Standard unblocked records will continue to have the same value as specified by the upstream DNS server.

From [dnsmasq man](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html):
> **-T, --local-ttl=<time>**

> When replying with information from /etc/hosts or configuration or the DHCP leases file dnsmasq by default sets the time-to-live field to zero, meaning that the requester should not itself cache the information. This is the correct thing to do in almost all situations. This option allows a time-to-live (in seconds) to be given for these replies. This will reduce the load on the server at the expense of clients using stale data under some circumstances.
Small heads up: This value will be changed to 2 in v3.2 :)

Basically, feel free to change this value in `01-pihole.conf` as it won't need applying again after the next update (unless you run `pihole -r` before then)
> read error: 0: Bad file descriptor

Very interesting! I'll pass this by the other devs and see if we can figure something out. Thanks!
Could you run `pihole checkout core development` and see if that version works? Let me know how that goes, and then you can revert using `pihole checkout core master`.

Thanks!
Your debug log helpfully shows that FTL is running smoothly in the background.

I suspect Chronometer is having issues with how the FTL data is being read - possibly not able to read the hard coded port file.

I’ll have to take another look at this when I’m in front of a computer, and not my phone :)
The DNS entry for a Pi-hole'd domain is returned as the IP address of your Pi-hole, and the Pi-hole IP returns the block page which acts differently depending on a few conditions. Currently, it's either going to return the "Website Blocked" page, or a single blank pixel depending on whether the user is directly browsing to the domain or not.

Next update, there'll be a few cases that trigger different results (this is what I remember off the top of my head anyway):

* Is there a HTTP referrer header set? Show a single blank pixel
* Is the URL being accessed *end* with a filename extension, and/or URL has a query string, such as (e.g: `?foo=true`) with no referrer set? Show a small unobtrusive "🚫 Blocked by Pi-hole" image
* Is there no extension (or is a valid web rendering extension such as `.php`, `.html`, etc)? Show "Website Blocked"

Hope this helps!
> If I have the option of implementing ad blocking through my router, what's the benefit of pihole?

A fully functional command line client, a web interface to control access and view graphs, a user friendly block page, and regular updates from developers such as myself who use PH daily!

> It seems safer to add the hosts pihole is using to my router blocking list in case some security hole is found in the pihole

The only issue that I can imagine occurring is one with `dnsmasq`, which is patched as soon as an issue is found. With router based DNS servers (even ones using `dnsmasq`), you often have to wait for a firmware update that *may* include any appropriate security fixes. I used to run adblocking on my Tomato router, and the hardware just couldn't keep up with the amount of sites I wanted to block - it'd choke on 400K, and PH blocks 1.2M domains with ease.

> Doesn't that mean the whole DNS has the possibility of getting poisoned?

Your local DNS cache via Pi-hole? Worst case scenario, one of the default blocklists gets hijacked and you have to whitelist a few extra sites to stop a useful website being redirected to your local blocked page.
> I was simply providing evidence from a second user supporting their claim that net neutrality is being spammed to MANY subreddits 

It would have helped to quote the bit you're specifically trying to refute, but the point you've made there is fair enough.
That's a bit of a strawman argument though, don't you agree?
I don't know about *storing* it, but you can block them from getting your personal data in the first place - https://pi-hole.net and /r/pihole
The Admin Console, the website that you use to change Pi-hole settings.

v3.2 doesn’t have an exact release date, but we’re in the final stages of the development cycle. As a ballpark figure, maybe a week or two depending on how busy the other devs are, assuming there’s no unforeseen complications?
If you’re a frequenter or /r/all, or are vaguely familiar with U.S. politics, you get it. I get that. However, it’s important that casual Reddit users see this message too, such as those who just use the Home tab, as well as show our support.

A bunch of us aren’t U.S. residents, so we can’t actually make calls to try and stop this from happening - so we need to at least show our support.
This is a completely valid point to bring up. I'm glad you've made it, and I've even upvoted you.

I'm going to start with a small nitpick first:

> so you can block ads on every site you visit stealing revenue from content creators

Stealing isn't the right word here. but "denying" is. We're not receiving ad revenue for anything we do, let alone obtaining ad revenue destined for anyone else. To imply anything else is *extremely misleading*.

-----

It is my world-view that independent content creators (YouTubers, artists such as comic authors, bloggers, etc) are the biggest victims of what we do, and there's absolutely no denying that. Having said that, privacy-invading advertising (Invasive due to cross-site user tracking and drive-by malware) has been a crutch of the Internet for far too long, and (IMHO) there are far better privacy respecting ways that content creators can generate income, such as:

* Donations via PayPal (once off, or reoccuring)
* Merchandise (such as apparel, books and the like)
* Subscription tiers like Patreon or Twitch (which allow users to provide a little or a lot directly in return for extra content)
* Affiliate links

These "alternative" revenue streams do not trade end-user privacy for a meagre couple of cents for each visiting user, so that monolithic companies like Google are able to get huge swathes of data for them to monetise en masse.

Take one of my all-time favourite comic artists for example: [Jeph Jacques](https://twitter.com/jephjacques) of the slice-of-life comic [Questionable Content](https://questionablecontent.net) - his site has ads, but he also has other fantastic revenue streams such as [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/shoppingcart?flowlogging_id=7825e1eb50661&mfid=1511387083021_a394f319ae02d#/checkout/openButton), [merchandise](https://topatoco.com/collections/jeph-jacques) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jephjacques). He's been doing the comic for 10 years, and IIRC, quit his job to do the comic full-time.

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/imzeferino/status/932650217433944064) is also another great example of how you can support artists. Make note that nowhere on that list is "whitelist their site if using an ad-blocker".
This is the correct answer. It used to check something crazy like every 10 seconds when Web Admin was open. v3.2 will check it once every 48 hours, resolving O.P’s issue.
1.	Pi-hole developers are strongly in favour of keeping the net neutral. We’ve participated in the past with Reddit activism on NN and we agree that this post is also worth while
2.	We feel it’s important to point out how a “Cable Package” style Internet can affect Pi-hole users too
3.	It’s a simple fact that you can’t make everyone in life happy, and unfortunately, this is one of those cases!
This kind of configuration isn't supported, and there'll be a guide available upon the v3.2 release that'll inform users how to enable HTTPS.
PCCG has always been great on the shipping, as well as the customer service. If you ever need to return something, make sure to ask PCCG for a paid return label so you don't need to whack stamps on.

Copy and paste (one line for each list) into the Block List box in settings, if that’s easy enough? :)
I definitely wouldn’t recommend adding everything :)

I’m sitting at about 1 million, and honestly, I don’t think I’d go above that until issues with `dnsmasq`’s slow startup time is resolved.

(Basically: large blocklist + IPv6 enabled means DNS is unresolvable for up to two minutes after an update (such as blacklisting) because it takes forever for the large blocklist to be read on slower Pi-like hardware)
If you haven’t installed something like Let’s Encrypt/Certbot, you should be fine on that front.

The Web Interface settings show Pi-hole’s currently configured IP address, and you need to compare this to the likes of `ifconfig` from Terminal. If they’re different, run `pihole -r` and choose reconfigure to change the address.
Pi-hole does this already. Make sure that:

* If you have IPv6 enabled, that the address is current
* You don’t enable HTTPS/TLS on your installation
`www.` is treated as a subdomain, basically.
I wish they had precompiled Linux/ARM clients so I could sync easily with my SBC NAS, but that’s the only thing I’d fault with them.
Not so simple, unfortunately.

We’re using `lighttpd`. The issue was that enabling HTTPS enabled TLS on blocked domains caused browsing issues such as OS cert mismatch pop ups on pages with blocked content, and/or pages loading slowly.

The next release will make it much easier for people to use Let’s Encrypt on their VPS and administer their Web Interface securely.
Seafile, as a self-hosted solution.
Face ID data is stored in the Secure Enclave, which you can read up about in [Apple’s Security Whitepaper](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf).

You can also look up the Secure Enclave yourself if you want to find more discussion on it.
We tend to release “when we’re ready”, which typically has been maybe every month or so. With v3.2, we wanted to integrate a *ton* of new stuff, so we haven’t seen a substantial update released in at least three months.

We’ve got an extreme case of release fever now, so rest assured that the next update is happening very soon™, and IMHO, will definitely be worth the wait.
I suppose if a domain has been blocked, you could use a custom `lighttpd` config to direct the user to another location!
Currently, there’s no easy way to allow HTTPS access to the Web Interface, because installing Let’s Encrypt is going to also enable TLS for blocked HTTPS pages too (which causes a load of issues with browsing).

The next update will allow users to add a TLS cert, that doesn’t trigger this issue. There’ll also be a FAQ that gives more info on how users can add this functionality too!

When you're talking about slow WiFi, are you referring to:

* Poor Internet browsing speeds?
* Poor WiFi reception around the house
* Slow LAN transfer speeds?

Pi-hole addresses the first point (by increasing browser responsiveness caching DNS queries, as well as blocking ads), but not the last two.

What's the benefit of supervised mode, in this particular case? I run my household iOS devices with a supervised profile, and don't see why OpenVPN would be worthless without it.
You can run an OpenVPN server which allows you to connect to your Pi-hole in a secure manner.
Hmm, that shouldn't be necessary. How are you accessing the API?

You can also see examples of `>forward-dest` [here](https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL).
Blocklists miss a bunch of stuff, so it doesn’t hurt to be a bit adventurous :)
Those of you using my [tick lists](https://wally3k.github.io), I've updated [my personal blacklist](https://v.firebog.net/hosts/static/w3kbl.txt) with this and `metrics.plex.tv`.
That’s because it has been! We [made a mention of the delay on this blog post](https://pi-hole.net/2017/09/29/pi-hole-will-be-participating-in-hacktoberfest/).

To explain a bit more, we’ve been taking the time to bang out a huge set of changes (over 40 for the core codebase alone), and those changes need a *lot* of testing (which includes us devs, and the adventurers using the `development` branch).

Between that and real life commitments among all the developers, it’s taken a bit longer than expected to push a solid update.
Correct!
Known issue, it'll be fixed in the next release :)
The `logrotate` application handles it via this config: https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/logrotate
That’s odd! You could try `pihole -g -f` to erase your previously downloaded lists and get fresh copies.
I’ve found this a niggling issue too, but you can just copy from the filter field on the top right.

Or, you can just hit the blacklist button on the right :)
In the blog post [How Much Traffic Can Pi-hole Handle?](https://pi-hole.net/2017/05/24/how-much-traffic-can-pi-hole-handle/), we explain that during the development of FTL, we tested a 4GB RAM VM and it was able to handle well over a million queries in 24 hours and that we were able to crank it up beyond that. We did this using a tool called [DNSBlast](https://github.com/pi-hole/dnsblast) which for all intents and purposes, is a DDoS utility that directly attacks a DNS server, rather than attacking a specific open port.

In your debug log, I can see a few things:

* You're running your tests on a Raspberry Pi 3B, which is CPU limited, and has 1GB of RAM. It is definitely *not* capable of sustaining a DDoS
* The `pihole-FTL` daemon was still active - it hadn't crashed (which we would expect it to if there was an issue)
* The `pihole-FTL` log does not indicate that anything had gone wrong

Any non-responsiveness would be attributed to the hardware being overloaded - you'd likely be able to tell this via the likes of `top`’s `sirq`.

FTL being indirectly DDoS'd by `dnsmasq` is definitely something we've taken into account, and at this point, I'm not seeing an issue that points to FTL being unresponsive, or the cause of bigger issues. We've got our ears open, so if there is something that we can address with a code fix, then we'll definitely (and strongly) consider it.
uBO Extra is a websocket blocker, and I’m certain that blocking a domain at the DNS level is already just as effective.
What websites have you seen these on?

Do you know if blocking the apex domain is effective, or do they need a wildcard block?

* If it only happens in one browser, try force refreshing or clearing the cache
Pi-hole isn't going to slow down load times in any way that's noticeable. Uncached name lookups may increase up to ~0.1s, and cached name lookups (such as blocked sites) are instant. You then have the Block Page, which ensures that blocked sites are handled quickly and effectively.
This, exactly.

Pi-hole covers my home network, and is my go-to when out and about on my phone as I'm more concerned about malicious sites and telemetry than I am my traffic being snooped on.

There's some things that strike me as a little odd in that log (nothing *bad*, but just not what I'm used to seeing), so I've passed it onto the other devs to see what they think!
Of course, the only appropriate reply would be “I have too little fucks to give”, right?

To the twat that is, rather than the blatant breaches in privacy that our Government is providing.
$60 for 2GB?! The [Rock64’s 2GB model](https://www.pine64.org/?product=rock64-media-board-computer) goes for $35, but it’s currently out of stock. You can still get the 1/4GB models though.

I bought the 4GB model, and aside from a teething issue preventing onboard sound from working (which was easily fixed), I’ve been extremely happy with it.
That’s right. They have valid reasons (location services works better, Apple Pencil, blah blah blah), but they really dropped the ball by not having soft-off as an *option* IMHO.
Control Centre has been around for a few iterations now, it's just iOS11 introduces a soft-off "feature" without any ability to revert to old (and generally preferable) behaviour of turning the WiFi/BT hardware off.
Yeah of course, as the only people that can read the associated logs are the Pi-hole devs! :)
Provide us with the token, so we can check your logs out :)
Let’s just hope it’s not a progress bar on the vote!
Jokingly, I feel they’re more equivalent to a Chooks period!
Yep!
Not via Pi-hole, no. You could however replace `/etc/pihole/whitelist.txt` automatically, and have a script run `pihole -g -sd` to update it. (`-sd` is an internal switch which ensures Gravity doesn't attempt to download new blocklists)
... and for whatever reason, we’ll be begging to pay for it.
I don’t block sites making use of the script, I block the script itself.

Thanks for the note about hackaday.com, I have let that list maintainer know.

You need to be able to find what list.# matches which blocklist. One of the upcoming features includes being able to do `pihole -q hackaday.com -adlist`, which returns the URL. From there, it’s just a matter of finding the email address for that maintainer.
It's all good, I definitely hear where you're coming from - I know there's an increasingly large number of cynical sysadmins out there who outright mock piping to bash, and honestly, I can totally understand where they're coming from. [This gif](https://www.idontplaydarts.com/images/bashmov.gif) from the blog post [Detecting the use of "curl | bash" server side](https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2016/04/detecting-curl-pipe-bash-server-side/) is a perfect example of why it's a terrible idea to only provide your software via this means.

As we're nearing the end of our current development cycle with the project, I've been working on redoing a lot of documentation. One thing I'm making sure with our `readme.md` is to provide the installation alternatives as clearly as the "One-Step Automated Install", and to link to *why* piping to bash is bad, just as clearly. One of the other things I've been doing is providing some documentation on each `pihole` command, with a link to the file the command is found in.

Obviously, not everyone has the skills (or desire) to read the code, but the members of the Open Source community *can* and *should* make it as easy as possible for those who are willing to vet our stuff, or even just take a curious glance. That way, it also helps foster a learning community of those who learn from the well written, commented and documented projects out there.
Derp, serves me right for not reading every word! Edited my post to have both :)
Top Domains (Those which aren't blocked):

`nc "127.0.0.1" "$(cat /var/run/pihole-FTL.port)" -q 1 <<< ">top-domains(50)"`

Blocked Domains:

I disagree that sites using Coinhive should be blocked, which is why I opted to block `coin-hive.com` in [my own ticked list](https://v.firebog.net/hosts/static/w3kbl.txt).
> Finally, Pi-Hole ran perfectly on older RPi devices with slower processors and lower memory, such as the original Model 1 (also Pi Zero).

That aspect is more important to us now more than ever, since FTL has set the bar so high! *All* the other codebases are basically now playing catchup behind-the-scenes in their own ways, and v3.2 is going to bring some neat quality of life improvements to help push this along :)
Regardless of the nature of your intent, our official standpoint is that we will not endorse or otherwise promote what you are requesting users do with the service you're offering.

I am politely, but firmly asking that this conversation ends here.
As long as you make it clear why piping to `bash` is unsafe (tl;dr: You can’t verify the code being run easily), then you empower users with the knowledge as to why you’d choose one install method over another.

I think that’s fair :)
To be fair, we at the Pi-hole project have made sure to provide alternative installation methods, and explain why [piping to `bash` can be dangerous](https://pi-hole.net/2016/07/25/curling-and-piping-to-bash/).

At the very least, I can't fault them for wanting to see what the one-step automated install was like!
If you’ve moved your configuration over from one device to another, make sure you run `pihole -r` and reconfigure so the correct RPi IP address is being added. That’s the only thing I can think of that isn’t related to a broken install.

If it’s the latter, you’re probably better off staring again. Just keep a note of your whitelist, blacklist and wildcard entries.
Ah damn hey? That’s not good!

I highly doubt it was caused by Pi-hole, so just ensure you try and at least get a copy of your whitelist and blacklist in `/etc/pihole` and wildcards in `/etc/dnsmasq.d/03-pihole-wildcard.conf` for yourself :)
Unfortunately, there's a few distros that don't include it by default (e.g: DietPi). I'll broach it with the team and see what we can do :)
Ah! Since we're just routing port 53 to the Pi-hole, that could work. `iptables` was never my strong suite :)
> The ps xu has nothing heavu or suspicius. Everything is max 1.2(sshd)

I don't follow what you mean by this. Are you able to follow my suggestion and see if inducing that CPU load will cause the system to stop responding?
The removing duplicates procedure is just running the `sort` command, which is multi-threaded and *extremely* CPU intensive. If that is failing, then I suspect that your hardware (whatever that might be), is unstable. That could potentially be caused by an unstable overclock, insufficient power, or faulty hardware.

I'd load up two Terminal windows: one with `htop`, and the other using the commands in  [this suggestion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2925606/how-to-create-a-cpu-spike-with-a-bash-command/2927364#2927364) to run your CPU under full load. If you find it's all working fine after a minute, press Ctrl-C, and then run `killall -9 dd`.
Being an Australian, I've got a mere 25/5Mbps connection and OpenVPN on the router has absolutely no trouble providing that.
You're almost guaranteed to be vulnerable (since I believe Tomato is using a relatively recent `dnsmasq`), and you have two options:

* Compile from source yourself
* Wait for an updated firmware image
Yeah, that's right. It's not bad, but the QoS is nothing compared to Tomato.
We don't have any desire to point fingers, however there's nothing to worry about. There was at least one particular company that was reaching out to users that were *already aware of their service*.
Check out LEDE before the others and see how you go; it’s the only viable replacement if you use Tomato for QoS IMHO.
LEDE, if your router supports it. I have an ASUS RT-AC68U, and LEDE doesn’t have WiFi drivers for it which means I’m stuck on Merlin.
He’s a father now and has little time to dedicate to the project, unfortunately.
It looks like something like this should be unnecessary!

The extra days worth of logs gives both us and the user flexibility (of give or take a few days) to be able to troubleshoot an issue they've seen. `pihole.log` and `pihole.log.1` (the past 48 hours) are uncompressed, and `pihole.log.2-5` are gzipped which will take up a fairly insignificant amount of disk space before they're eventually deleted.
Hasn’t been the case since around v3.0, when FTL was released.
No, not in a way that would ever prevent the device admin from giving their logs away willingly :)
~~Honestly, I’m not sure why it isn’t already. I’ll bring it up with the other devs!~~

Depends on your needs. The fastest is almost always going to be your ISP, but many people believe their ISP will use the information gathered to sell your browsing history. Google is going to be in that boat more-so.

If that’s not a concern, go for one of those two. If it is a concern, try something like [DNS Watch](https://dns.watch) or [Fusl’s DNS CDN](http://dnsrec.meo.ws).

Also consider [benchmarking](https://www.grc.com/dns/benchmark.htm) your different options to ensure you’ve got the fastest one that suits your needs.
`logrotate` is already installed. It’s set to rotate logs for six days, and purge ones older than that.
When using the debug tool, it’s encrypted during transit and stored securely on our server. That’s not the issue, though.

The Pi-hole logs are unencrypted when on your system, and for troubleshooting sake, it’s important for it to stay that way.
As we say in the blog post: it’s important to us that your private data stays private.

We’ve got no interest, because that’s our moral standpoint. In reality, ISP’s have fought battles to be able to sell your browsing history without your consent, and that’s exactly what Pi-hole logs.
TTL caching isn’t an issue any more, but IIRC it would rely on the Pi-home being in a position to use `iptables`, such as a gateway/Router.

The Pi-hole is designed to attach to the network like any old client, so that’s not something you can really rely upon either. Still, I appreciate the thought; have an upvote!
Yeah, really. It's just the wrong tool for the job.

As I've said, this is something I've desperately wanted for Pi-hole for at least an entire year now, having come from [Privoxy](http://www.privoxy.org) which has this very feature. The difference with that is that it's a full-fledged proxy that routes all your data through it, and it's also a giant performance hog on ARM based hardware like the Raspberry Pi.

I have a VPN which I have SSH access to, so I resolve this issue by:

* Running `autossh` on my router (`autossh -f -gND 8080`), which keeps a SOCKS connection active on my LAN
* Running SwitchOmega with Quick Switch enabled, allowing me to enable my VPN at the click of a button in my browser (Connects to `10.0.0.1:8080`)

For my mobile devices, I just fall back to 4G data.
That would be a good one to wildcard block. What site or mobile application have you seen that domain be used by, out of interest?
This delves into another aspect of Pi-hole, so I apologise if this comes off as complicated.

If Pi-hole is the DHCP server (which it may not be!), one could write a config that causes specific MAC ID's to have a different upstream DNS server. This would have the effect of bypassing Pi-hole entirely, but then you have little control over when the client decides to renew the DHCP lease which will make the client use the Pi-hole.

Unfortunately, it still has the same issue - changing the `dnsmasq` config requires a reload, which triggers the "reading the large file" launch delay.

> Because right now anytime I disable for X seconds it's disabled for everybody instead of just me?

Yes. If you use the "disable for x seconds" feature, Pi-hole is *disabled for everyone*.




It's something I've wanted for the Block Page since its very conception as a third party project, but despite the progress we've made trying to implement it (e.g: We've recently lowered the TTL of blocked content to 5s in the `development` branch), isn't something we can do reliably and safely.

The first biggest consideration to take into mind is that when the DNS server starts up, it has to take time to re-load the blocklists. On lower end hardware (e.g: ARM based CPU's) with *many lists* (double the time when IPv6 is enabled), this process can take up-to two minutes before you can start "resolving" websites.

With this in mind, we can temporarily disable Pi-hole in its entirety very quickly (because we "remove" the giant list that can take a long time to read), but we can't "temporarily whitelist" a domain quickly in a reliable manner. We would need to run `pihole disable`, detect when the requested domain has been loaded (or wait a period of time), and then start up with full blocking. 

This brings the biggest "safety" issue: other unwanted content gets through because one site was bypassed.
My blockbuster wrote it on the inside of the VHS box they loaned it out in.
The problem is that this list will likely affect legitimate ~~owners~~ renters of Adobe CC products, which isn’t something I should be supporting :)
As in configured by default: The admin will need to go out of their way to enable LE.
> Thanks. I think I'm going to toss away the Facebook app in general. I never use it. Just the messenger part of it, so I might just piss it off altogether then.

I ended up at a point where I only had messenger installed, but realised that the people who genuinely use it to contact me (opposed to people who *may want to* contact me) could just as easily use SMS/iMessage. Better for my battery life, and better for my privacy that way!

> As for Tumblr, I don't use it only my S.O. uses it. None of my current blocklists seem to deal with ads in that app.

I've found that the app seems to employ some aggressive ad caching, making it hard to troubleshoot what domain the ad comes from. On an iOS device, you'd need to (at minimum) force close the app, and enable Airplane mode for 5 seconds to ensure you can flush as many caches as possible without reinstalling the app.

> Youtube ads seem to be blocked with that list you provide but as others have said, not the initial ad.

It's not a complete list, so some ads may get through while others don't. I barely use YouTube, so I haven't yet seen an ad on my browser or on my phone honestly!
Not just a Raspberry Pi, but almost any piece of modern Linux hardware! (Just as long as it isn’t some kind of Router running a cut-down embedded distribution)
From your affected PC, run: `nslookup doubleclick.net` and provide the output please :)
Pi-hole does that by default (the equivalent of REJECT rather than DROP), as the `lighttpd` install isn’t serving any content on 443.
YouTube and Facebook implement ads in such a way that they don’t just come from one easily blockable subdomain, they come from many.

One avid Pi-he user has gone to a lot of trouble to block YouTube - [you can try this list](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/adac7982307fec6ee23605e281a57f1a/raw/5b8582b906a9497624c3f3187a49ebc23a9cf2fb/Test.txt) and see how you go.

I’ve had mixed success finding the right domains to block for the Tumblr iOS app - but the S.O doesn’t really use it any more, so I don’t know if my current blocklists cover it. Same deal for Facebook: neither of us use it (and frankly, we’re better off without it!).
While not automatic, the next update will allow users to have the likes of Let’s Encrypt secure their `lighttpd` install in a way that doesn’t break the block page :)
I agree with this. When the requirement is that a user must change their password at a scheduled interval, one will almost always append a trivial number to the end of it.

With a password manager, you can generate long (16+ chars), unique and secure passwords before enabling 2FA. With a unique generated password and 2FA, it doesn't matter *when* the site gets breached because:

* An attacker would need to crack the salt first (which can be trivial, or complex!)
* Would need the TOTP secret
* Would need to do all this before you're aware of the breach (As said elsewhere, [HIBP is an invaluable service](https://haveibeenpwned.com/))
* Would not be able to use the password or TOTP secret anywhere else

If you're a follower of good OPSEC, you would be putting as little personal information on the account as possible - making it pretty useless if someone was to take control of it without your knowledge.
2.76-5 is the latest that Stretch has available, so I think you're fine.
It says that on the Google blog, yes, but the CVE’s are patched according to the Debian tracker.

That is, assuming I’m reading it right!

I had the ability to update to 2.76-5+deb9u1 (Stretch) today, but I don’t have a Jessie device readily available to test on.
Hah, all good! Check out the ticked lists, and see how that runs.

By disabling, I mean on your router - disable the ability to use IPv6 (if it has the option) and then once  done, you can run `pihole -r` to reconfigure your installation without v6.
You can add and remove blocklists as you please, and use the Top Sites feature to see what gets queried the most.

With the next release, you’ll be able to see stats beyond the last 24 hours too!
https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/pull/1163

We end up getting stuck because there was an issue with `lighttpd` that prevented the update from completing. I’m not too sure about the finer details, otherwise.
2.72+deb8u1 is the latest version for those on Jessie, and your security tracker link suggests that this already has those disclosed vulnerabilities patched.

Run `sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade` to ensure you’re up to date.
It’s unavoidable when you’re running all those lists (which I honestly can’t recommend doing unless you’re running on x86 type hardware).

If you have IPv6 enabled on your network and you don’t need it, you can consider disabling it to cut the load time by over half.
Yep, will be fixed in the next release.
As far as I'm aware, Siri can't do much of anything if it's disabled via Settings > General > Restrictions.

It's never been useful to me, so I have no reason to enable it.
Parsing Adblock lists is a genuinely interesting beast, honestly!

If you take a look at the [Adblock Plus filter cheatsheet](https://adblockplus.org/filter-cheatsheet), I understand that you can only reliably use the example 2 type domain names, and out of those, only a few such as important third-party or popup are actually usable. You then need to filter out a few more things, and then take whitelisted domains from the same source list into account.

It's important to do this because you could otherwise end up with massive false positives. Take [this one list you've posted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamja/Prebake/master/obtrusive.txt), for example: its aim is to remove the obtrusive notices that specific sites use to tell you about cookies, in the format of `domain.com###divname`. All of these kinds of lists should be filtered out and not used at all, because the *site itself* isn't bad - and adblock lists are littered with this kind of thing that isn't relevant for DNS sinkholing.

I've put a fair amount of time into [this code](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/60365ad36a84b3bc99cdca8f0d5c5350842608a7/gravity.sh#L288) to make it as efficient (and effective!) as possible, so you might be interested in checking it out. :)
Pi-hole aims to be as lightweight and fast as possible, and one of the things that this means is making sure the scripts executed are as fast as possible on the likes of underclocked Raspberry Pi 3B's, and standard Pi Zeros.

I've found that a well crafted `awk` can parse an adblock style list of one million in under two seconds on this kind of hardware, and that's a great example because there's *so little content* one can actually use from those types of lists.

However, I'm genuinely curious: What sort of faulty characters are you looking to remove, and what lines/files are you seeing them in? Reading the `sed`, I see:

* Anything starting with 2/3 ##'s until the end of the line
* , $ @#
* ^ to the end of the line


Hey /u/supremetoaster,

I totally understand where you're coming from, but the way you've done this isn't very efficient - `sed` is *miserably* slow on large files, and will run on lists even if they don't need this kind of filtering.

The next release *should* have you covered when it comes to non-standard blocklists :)
As it says on the Web Interface:
> Note: Whitelisting a subdomain of a wildcard blocked domain is not possible.

I haven't tested this, but you could try the following:
`echo "server=/mysaferudomain.ru/8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/dnsmasq.d/wildcardoverride.conf; pihole restartdns`

It should force the DNS lookup to use Google instead of using the locally blocked result.
I’ve found the iOS application is pretty good, but I only use it as a backup for the three most used tokens I keep stored on my Yubikey.
I don’t want to outright spoil anything for anyone, but I’ll give some ‘hints’ on some of the major changes:

* The last 24 hours won’t be a limitation on statistics
* We’ll be supporting the parsing of more than just one type of source list
* One of my long standing unofficial Pi-hole projects will be superseded (but here’s another hint: it’s not related to the second point)
I’d recommend a UHS-1, because you want to have fairly fast 512K/4K writes.

The Raspberry Pi 3B, for example, is capable of around 20MB/s (when not overclocked), and U1 brings those tiny scattered writes up to 10MB/s (even if it brings sequential reads up above 80MB/s).

It helps with:

* The time it takes the hardware to reboot
* `pihole -g/-b/-w` (Blocklist generation, blacklisting and whitelisting)
* Reading large files (Such as what the DNS server has to do whenever it gets reloaded, which is worse when people have large blocklists and IPv6 enabled)
Yeah, you can create any file (including this one), and it’ll work as long as it’s in `/etc/dnsmasq.d`. Just make sure to restart `dnsmasq` after.
We always presume people would rather wait and receive stable software, but it’s far more reassuring to get confirmation that people aren’t begrudgingly waiting!

We’ve got over *thirty* tweaks/additions/fixes in the core (‘Pi-hole’ repo specific) codebase alone, with some things being entirely rewritten.

So, we’re testing, testing some more, and testing harder to try and break things before release.

We think the wait will be worth it :)
We did exactly this [just over a week ago](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/pull/1701) - the biggest issue is that when `dnsmasq` starts, it can take up to two minutes for it to be resolvable depending on the hardware it’s running on, and the amount of content that you block.

So while we could fairly easily throw in a “disable for x seconds/whitelist for y seconds” type thing for the Block Page, it’s not just going to simply work for everyone as a reliable feature.
We'd love to add a "Temporarily bypass this block" on a per-site basis feature, but it's a bit hard due to local DNS caching. We've made changes recently that might make it viable to revisit this idea though, so I'll definitely keep it in mind!
I appreciate the thought, but I'm quite happy with my Pro edition of W8.1 :)
It always helps to check that it is in fact fixed, since it's not appearing on `nslookup`, but either way, I think you're going to be fine :)
Hmm, it still sounds like the issue we've fixed! Perhaps you could see if you're able to reproduce the issue after running `pihole checkout dev` (you can go back to the main release with `pihole checkout master`)
No, that's not a feature that we have. I'd recommend creating a [Feature Request](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/c/feature-requests) with this idea, so that we can better track how many people would like to have this feature!
To confirm: If you run `nslookup pi.hole`, it comes up with the name `data.livefyre.com`?

If so, this is a [known issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/717kn8/weird_bug_pihole_hostname_first_blocklist_item/) that'll be fixed on next release.


Many Adblock lists will insert junk into your blocklists, and can cause false positives. Also, the `sed` code does nothing from within `adlists.list`!
This includes many Adblock filters, which Pi-hole doesn’t support - also the bottom of that paste had shell code to parse one of those lists. That won’t work either!

You’re better off using the Adblock lists at https://wally3k.github.io for now :)
Unfortunately, this is the biggest downside for having many lists: `dnsmasq` takes up to 2m to load!
`pihole uninstall` would be the correct uninstall procedure :)
All the cool kids are using [SD Memory Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/) and [Etcher](https://etcher.io) these days!

Speaking as a person who didn't have to deal with the installation of SF on the server, I'd definitely say yes.

There were a few hiccups that occurred due to it having been set up without TLS first, but other than the occasional sync conflict (which honestly, I think *should* be handled better) that occurs, it's been a pretty solid setup.

My current setup involves having a desktop client sync a locally mounted SMB volume, which ensures both off-device and off-site backups; though I need to look into compiling an ARM binary so my SBC can sync without a desktop client.

The snapshots feature has also saved me a couple of times - most notably when the latest iTunes update failed to launch on Win 8.1, which prevented my music library from launching when rolled back to the previous working version.
E2E is a big reason why I chose Seafile as a self-hosted backup solution. It's good to see Nextcloud are doing the same!
> I just found out about Pi Hole yesterday.

Welcome to the community!

Pi-hole acts as a local DNS "proxy"; it sits between you (your devices) and the upstream DNS server (in your case, Google @ 8.8.8.8) filtering out certain requests, and caching others which results in a smoother browsing experience.

So to answer your question: When you first install Pi-hole, you'll be given the choice of which upstream DNS resolver to use - you can just pick the Google preset, and it'll continue to ask you a few other questions.

For your clients, you'll want to ensure that the only DNS resolver they can see is the Pi-hole, otherwise queries (such as content that should be blocked) will leak out.
Start a new trend by wearing a wide brim hat and sunglasses indoors!
Coming soon to a Saints Row DLC near you.
Depends if your aim is to stop NSA type tracking, or just Westfield :)
It doesn't matter if you connect to their WiFi or not, you need to turn it off entirely to not be tracked.
You can either:

* [Query the FTL engine directly at your desired interval and retrieve the appropriate stats](https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL/blob/master/README.md#implemented-keywords-starting-with--subject-to-change)
* Query the long term SQLite database `/etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.db` for stats on previous days
> it has a small switch set between it and the router itself. Would that cause problems?

It shouldn't! Since troubleshooting this kind of issue can be a bit hard without access to the device itself (and all the information the debug log provides), I've flagged this with the other devs in case they've got ideas.
It sounds like your Pi-hole might be having issues connecting to the Internet - so that's definitely the issue you'll want to look into solving.

* Check `ifconfig` and start by seeing if it has a valid LAN IP address (you can DM me this info if you're not familiar with this)
* If that looks okay, try running `wget -qO - https://pi-hole.net | grep "<title>"` and see if that returns the tag line for Pi-hole
* Check the output of `pihole status` in case the built-in DNS server is specifically having issues

That should give us a start!
Run `pihole -d`, upload the debug log when prompted, and provide the token it gives back to you.

That should help us narrow down what's happening here!
With browser based tools, It's not exactly easy to be totally sure.

At least with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net), you can see a log of the top sites you've contacted and manually block any that have been missed by the automated lists - that way, a "regular dude" can know.
What you explain is somewhat how dedicated servers would work in the golden days of FPS. You'd have an individual/group/gaming service provider host a server for a particular game (let's choose Counter-Strike as an example, as I'm well versed in CS administration).

The administrators or community of the dedicated server instance would observe and record evidence of the cheater, which can then be submitted for a permanent ban from that server. This was good, because firstly, it meant that the turn-around-time for a banned cheater would be under a week. Secondly, it meant that the built-in Anti-Cheat (Valve's Anti Cheat) could sit in the background quietly collecting the unique account identifiers (Steam ID's) and do "ban waves" after several months (and in some case, unacceptably, *years*).

The reason it isn't the FPS golden days any more is down to a single word: matchmaking. Thanks to the console-isation of PC games, dedicated servers aren't as mainstream as they used to be, and the developer now has to spin up several Amazon AWS (or other cloud provider of choice) instances to host their dedicated server code which they don't share with the community.

Now, banning blatant cheaters has to fall back to the anti-cheat - but remember how I said this took months, or years to do banwaves? This is why they now supplement their detection with crowd sourced cheater review system called "Overwatch", which occurs when a specified number of people report another player ingame for cheating. That dishes out a temporary ban until VAC has the time to kick in.

This has put pressure on Valve to actually increase the effectiveness of VAC - except it's taken them over ten years to get their priorities straight and make it detect cheats that it had otherwise let slide for years.

It's a bit of a crap tradeoff, and it's an even crapper game of cat vs mouse between Valve and the cheaters because ultimately, it's the legitimate community that loses in the long run - accusing all their own failings on external circumstances such as lag and hacks, instead of genuinely trying to improve themselves. The game of cat and mouse has fostered the creation a toxic community that I no longer participate in.

Now, the Counter Strike community has to trust that Valve aren't breaching their privacy - but for most players, privacy is the least of their concerns.
Still sounds spot on, sadly!
From routers, I almost always expect it to be some sort of lazy online connectivity test.
> I believe that changing that IPV4_ADDRESS variable to 0.0.0.0 makes the pihole software believe that its own IP address is 0.0.0.0?

[It looks like](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=IPV4_ADDRESS&type=) it might cause issues with debugging and Chronometer, but I think that's about it.

Specifying your own [`address=/` entries](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html) within `/etc/dnsmasq.d/nappiestapparatus.conf` is a safer option though! (Any changes require `sudo service dnsmasq restart` or `pihole restartdns`)

They shouldn't be. You can test your own IP at [openresolver.com](http://www.openresolver.com)
OpenVPN is different, it requires authentication. DNS is open to anyone, and is prone to [DNS reflection attacks](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=dns+reflection+attack).
I don't mean to downplay you, I absolutely hear where you're coming from. Unfortunately, it's pretty much the nature of free will that people accept risks - in this case, that an open resolver gets them.

To give everyone some idea of some statistics to compare to, *each week* we see:

* According to Github, we see over 6,000 unique clones of the core repository (Clones occur when someone installs, or repairs Pi-hole)
* According to Cloudflare, my big blocklist nets at least 3,500 unique hits each Sunday (when Pi-hole automatically updates its lists and specifically hits `v.firebog.net`)

On top of this, you're only seeing the amount of people that have web ports forwarded, as you're seeing the HTTP `X-Pi-hole` header. I don't have stats on hand that show how many of those are *open* resolvers. I think it's safe to say that the majority of users aren't willing to accept the security risks of an open resolver!
Pi-hole by default will only listen locally, so I can only presume that these people have willingly selected "Listen on all interfaces, permit all origins".

<600 for the entirety of the U.S. means we've done a pretty damn good job for a project that could *easily and greatly* contribute to DNS reflection attacks.

My take from this: people lack the foresight to know what we'll need in the future, and nbn™ under the Coalition's guidance is a perfect example of this. nbn™ are essentially arguing "So what if FTTN struggles to get to 100Mbit? Nothing *needs* 50Mbit right now, so she'll be right for the future mate" despite the fact that this infrastructure needs to last us a *minimum* of 30 years.

> Sounds like plugins or something will eventually cover the speed test thing at some point, thanks

I've brought up the question of plugins before, but the question comes back to "Why should it be a part of Pi-hole"? By removing restrictions like the forced javascript redirect, we're allowing users to develop their own content and run it alongside their Pi-hole, but not *inside* it. I feel it's a case where we'll make a plugins API if there's a good use case that convinces us that this is the right direction to take, but until then, there's dozens of other things we'd like to work on (and *have* time to!).

> I'm in Australia, over 98% of your customers here, would have no issues with bandwidth testing at "only" 50Mbps, most of us have from 2 - > 30Mbps at most. (Also to be fair, even if you have an 80mbit line and it's capped at 50mbit, it's still useful data to see that blip / moment that you're dipping below 50)

I'm an Australian too (moved to where fibre NBN was already rolled out), so I totally hear you. Nothing's stopping anyone from running [Speedtest CLI](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) and intergrating the `csv` output into a spreadsheet. Personally, I logged output to a text file for about a year to determine what congestion was like in my area - I end up stopping because it had only occured once and was fixed within the week. (Internode's still good for something!)

Our development branch is generally very stable (Technically, we do have the stance that development is allowed to be broken, but it *very rarely* ever is) and lengthy testing is primarily to ensure that there aren't edge cases (unusual setups) that break things in ways we didn't expect.
Ah, you must be on mobile where flairs don't show? Yeah, I primarily work on the `bash` core codebase.

> I could wait though, it won't be much longer, woudl it?

Right now, there's only the bug mentioned in this post (that's relatively minor), so we've been taking the time to really flesh out a large set of changes - so right now, there's *absolutely no ETA* for v3.2. Gotta make sure that we test, test and test some more so we're not releasing broken work!

> Did you guys consider adding that guys custom graph which does a check of the speed once an hour? that might be really useful - just as an optional extra.

While it's a super cool modification, it's definitely not something we'll be considering adding, for a few reasons:

* It's outside the scope of a DNS server, and that we're a very lightweight project that uses very little bandwidth
* It's nice enough that it should be its own project, and it should make good use of [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io)
* Many people run Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi, which doesn't have the speeds to be testing Internet connections above 50Mbps

What we opted to do instead was remove some `lighttpd` restrictions, so people can more easily host their own content (the Pi's IP address won't redirect to a blank page now, making it a nicer user experience), and will allow user-hosted Javascript instead of forcibly redirecting it to a blank file.
Long Term Data, yep. You can check it out by running `pihole checkout dev` (and returning using `pihole checkout master`)
No, they're not. The whitelist dates back to 2013 (when I started adblocking using my router), and I haven't figured out which are no longer necessary and what each of them is for.

That makes me think there's an issue with how Pi-hole (and/or the client) is set up then, because they shouldn't be coming through if you're using Pi-hole as your only DNS server.
Of course you can, we're just utilising DNS in a similar fashion to the `/etc/hosts` file.

Except by putting it on the device, you're losing the ability to have many block lists on your device and have them all update at once.

Your debug log checks out as okay.

404 for the Admin Console suggests that the PHP5 service has stopped. Since that's possibly both PHP and SSH services cutting out, that means that you're having issues beyond the scope of Pi-hole.

I'm thinking there's a couple of issues here:

* You could be experiencing undervoltage - you can check this with `sudo vcgencmd get_throttled` (Pi 3B only) and seeing if it returns anything other than "0x0"
* Raspbian could be corrupted, and you may be running into a kernel panic - you'd be able to look through the system logs on reboot and see what's happening

I'd suggest going into Admin Console and getting a Teleporter backup ASAP, because having a backup would be good for safe keeping.

I see where you're coming from, (and maybe this is a bit pendantic of me to say) but it's a bit of a stretch to say that companies like Apple, Facebook or Google are faceless, when you've got Cook, Zuckerberg and Brin standing in the spotlight.

Now if you were to say Apple, Facebook or Google are *soulless* because they're beholden to the mass of shareholders, I'd wholeheartedly agree with that.

Again though, I totally get where you're coming from.
Unfortunately with YouTube and Pi-hole, there's no easy silver bullet solution. Having said that, I believe /u/deathbybandaid had a bigger list that may help you (he would have to find it and link you to it, if he's still got a copy).

Out of interest, what qualifies itself as a faceless corporation, given that previously Steve Jobs was the face of the company and now Tim Cook?
Class 4 is a minimum of 4MB/s sequential write speed, which will do the job and shouldn't cause any *problems* on a default blocklist install, but it's not optimal because it means non-sequential writes (smaller, scattered file access) will likely be absolutely garbage.

This could present itself as an issue with:

* Slow Raspberry Pi boot time (and potentially `apt-get` updates)
* DNS being unresolvable on clients while `dnsmasq` parses your blocklist after the daemon restarts (Restarting triggered when retrieving new block lists via Gravity, whitelisting, blacklisting, wildcarding and configuring certain options from Web Admin)
* Slow blocked domain queries, which affects `pihole -q` and the block page

Most of this won't be a noticeable issue with the default blocklists - but it's something to keep in mind if you venture out to block more.
I run all the blocklists on my big list, which is about 1.2M. Honestly, I don't find much in the way of false positives now that I've been running it for long enough - but having said that, my whitelist is at 171 entries! :)
You don't make friends with ~~salad~~ Wodonga.
Run `pihole -d` (upload the debug log and provide the token it spits out) so we can try and find out what's dying (is it `dnsmasq`?) and how we might be able to resolve that :)
Perform an `nslookup` on these domains, they could be CNAME aliases, where the aliased domain has been Pi-hole'd.

Checking your debug log, I see:

* msn.com is a CNAME: `reply www-msn-com.a-0003.a-msedge.net is <CNAME>` (try whitelisting that)
* ossic.com returns the same IP addresses that my `nslookup` does (try flushing your DNS cache and restarting your browser)

It's `dnsmasq` format, so it doesn't require Pi-hole to make it compatible - but also bypasses Pi-hole (and any control it has to alter that blacklist) entirely.
Yeah, because the ping to your upstream DNS server can potentially be felt with every new website you visit. Namebench does essentially the same thing.
> What does any of that have to do with using pi-hole?

O.P was asking about DNS.Watch, which is an upstream DNS server. Pi-hole is *not* an upstream DNS server, meaning you'd still need to find one that isn't Google or your ISP.
They're Google Adsense ads (Top right, teal icon within a square) and you're using Chrome. Try this: https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/why-do-i-see-ads-in-chome-but-not-other-browsers/3284
Pi-hole is a *local* DNS cache that employs DNS sinkholing features - you still need an upstream DNS that you can trust. (e.g: A provider geographically close to you that supports `dnscrypt` such as http://dnsrec.meo.ws)

As an Australian, DNS.Watch is not a great choice for me as their servers are over 300ms away. Pi-hole can alleviate that with its caching ability, but still.
What a shame that they aren't!

> /u/wally3k mentioned it would stop updates from coming through if you change the contents of the file. Is this true? 

I believe you've misunderstood what I would have said. If you customise either `/var/www/html/pihole/index.php` or `/var/www/html/pihole/blockingpage.css`, these two files will *not* get updated when you update the rest of Pi-hole. Since they don't change often, it's not a big concern. :)

Though honestly, /u/Mcat12 said it more simply:

> Pi-hole will only install the block page once, so your changes won't affect anything else.
As an Australian on Internode (which is still considered a fairly premium brand), I stick with my ISP's DNS - they have DNS resolvers in each state, provide local CDN content for popular downloads (Steam, Origin, iTunes, Netflix & more) which is a *huge* benefit and are very reliable.

The downsides are metadata retention and that they're block certain websites mandated by court orders. If there's something I don't want going via my residential connection, I'll use a VPN. Heck, I run a SSH+SOCKS+`proxy.pac` setup which automatically redirects sites with certain words in them through my VPN, so I don't need to think about that kind of thing.

If I was genuinely concerned that my ISP was snooping my browsing behavior and/or monetising it, I'd probably use something off http://dnsrec.meo.ws
> It was enabled for me but still causing speed issues until I manually edited the config file

Huh, good to know. I've also passed that on :)

I appreciate the kind words, and I'm sure the team does too!
Yep, that's the one!
I remember experiencing an issue ages back (well before I really started helping out) where multiple interfaces causes slowdowns (Onboard Eth+USB Eth).

The solution is to run `pihole -a -i single`, which will force Pi-hole/`dnsmasq` to "Listen only on interface <interface configured when you set up Pi-hole>"

It defaults to listening to all interfaces, which as you've come to realise, isn't optimal. I'll have a talk to the other devs and see what we can do about sorting this out!
Using the link you provided, you can manually copy and paste the results into the appropriate section in Web Admin.

If you're cron job inclined, you can create a reoccurring job for `wget -qO - https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick | sudo tee /etc/pihole/adlists.list`
Malicious? Not really. The only accepted externally sourced blocklist has to be in HOSTS format, which does not allow for wild cards.

When we wildcard something in Pi-hole, we're making use of `dnsmasq`'s `address` option which we don't provide a means of automating an update of.
Indeed, currently resolvable by installing `php-zip`.
FWIW to anyone playing at home, this issue will be fixed in the next Pi-hole release.
I personally intended it to be fully customisable when I provided the Pi-home Dev team the source code and rights to my original block page works :)
Yeah, that's right - changing the contents of the file will make it not get updated.
The Pi-hole update determines whether either of these two files have been modified, and if so, keeps the current version(s).
I haven't tested others, so I wasn't going to speak with any kind authority about things I'm not 100% certain about :)
At least three of the four bullet points would still be an issue with DD-WRT - the automated testing probably being the biggest issue. We don't test our releases manually on every distribution, and rely on automation to do it for us - so we would need some sort of virtualised DD-WRT install to test upon.
Short answer, nothing that we support.

[It is a popular feature request](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/pihole-directly-on-routers-tomato-merlinwrt-dd-wrt-openwrt/1314), and while I'd love to see it happen, there's a number of reasons holding us back:

* Limited hardware specs - many high end routers don't have more than 256Mb RAM, which is the *safest minimum* I'd personally recommend anyone run on
* Embedded router distros make use of `busybox`, which has a limited `sh` environment instead of `bash` - so our behemoth of an installation script needs to get rewritten. We'd also need to test to ensure that we're not making use of any stripped out features that `busybox` has a minimal program for
* Embedded router distros make use of Port 80 already, and sometimes don't allow for non router admin password protected webpages. We need to be able to serve a block page on Port 80, which is a limitation of `dnsmasq`
* While we scrape by with donations, we don't have the funds necessary to be buying router hardware to manually, or automatically test our software on

Basically: it's something we'd love to do, but would take a *lot* of work.
The name that Pi-hole gives as itself when resolving anything such as `nslookup pi.hole` (or `ping` too, I haven't tested tbh) will be one of a randomly blocked domain.

This is a known issue that's fixed in the next release.

That's weird, I haven't had that when I used it in the past!
Pi-hole runs very nicely on a Pi Zero - even on WiFi.
This is basically what I use to review the top domains provided by FTL:

`nc "127.0.0.1" "$(cat /var/run/pihole-FTL.port 2> /dev/null)" -q 1 <<< ">top-domains (100)" | awk '{ if ($2) {print $2" hits: "$3}}'`

The next update is planned to have an option for "Long Term Stats" which will allow you to view more than just the current days worth of stats.
> I assume it will be resolved in the next release.

That's what we're aiming for! :)
RAS is not FF57+ compatible (and probably won't ever be), so you'll want to [follow these instructions instead](https://www.ghacks.net/2016/12/28/firefox-52-better-font-fingerprinting-protection/).
The caching side of Pi-hole would be perfect for something like https://dns.watch/ which doesn't appear to be hosted on a CDN (which could therefore have very high pings, and delayed responses for forwarded queries).

Another DNS provider one could use is http://dnsrec.meo.ws
The latest Nvidia driver (385.41) made it really common for me, I see it most commonly for shrubs and trees. [These Farcry 4 screenshots (not mine)](https://imgur.com/a/cJ0GK) show almost exactly what I see in PUBG.

You can run it on any modern *nix hardware, though many do opt into buying a dedicated Raspberry Pi!
For whitelisting? Pretty sure it isn't an accepted character by `dnsmasq`.
If you whitelist `domain.com`, it won't affect `foo.domain.com`. The same goes for blacklisting, unless you wildcard it.
I suppose it's possible to add an exclusion via another rule, but I haven't tested it.
Between two users and 10 devices, I'll see anywhere from 6-16% blocked daily.

You'll get a feel for what's right after a weeks worth of keeping an eye on the stats, because everyone's usage habits are different!
Generally speaking on a SOHO network with <50 clients, you're not going to see any difference.

Technically, `gravity` list generation will be quicker (`sort -u` is bottlenecked by the CPU, despite being multi-threaded), but since that's automated weekly, the average person won't see it as a concern.
If you do `nslookup doubleclick.net` or the like, the host name is one of a randomly blocked site.

This is a known issue that's fixed in the next release :)

Double check to make sure `pihole -a -i all` is enabled, because it sounds like it's set to `pihole -a -i local`! :)

> Am I opening myself up to weird shit by having it listening even if it never answers?

*Probably* not.
If you're going to go down the route of having an open DNS resolver (opposed to securing the connection via OpenVPN), make sure you've opened port 53 *and* changed Pi-hole's Interface Listening Behaviour (`pihole -a -i all`).

Please ensure that you have some safeguards in place to prevent it becoming a part of a [DNS amplification attack](https://blog.cloudflare.com/deep-inside-a-dns-amplification-ddos-attack/).
TR-069 has legitimate uses; many ISP's worldwide use it to remotely manage user settings and firmware. Configuring it insecurely though? Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.
> Sure, an insider attack can only be stopped by good controls inside the security group.

This doesn't involve an insider attack, it involves the ISP configuring TR-069 (basically: remote firmware update software) to either use HTTP, or not validate HTTPS certificates which leads to a third party being able to compromise the ISP's Auto Configuration Server.

The presentation while a bit cringy, [is found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlID0CH3j4M).
All you need is one ISP-hired person to set up a HTTP implementation of TR-069 and suddenly you've "pwned" the entire ISP.
Not to downplay your efforts, but I feel it's worth mentioning: the reason I haven't made a single unified file is because literally the only benefit is having a unified file. Though admittedly, you have removed whitelisted sites - something which I want to avoid getting into because I don't want to have the responsibility of both blacklisting and whitelisting (too much power is not a good thing, especially when whitelisting should be powered by the user! :))

The cons are that you lose the ability to skip lists which update irregularly, and you're forced to download the entire file again for every single change that's made. On top of this, you've hosted the lists using a raw GitHub link (instead of GitHub IO pages) which will be forced to download even with no changes made due to a lack of a Last-Modified header.
I use a standard Apple USB keyboard (MB110LL/A) plugged directly into my Pi3 just fine.
Why adult sites in particular? Any mobile client can switch to their 4G/LTE connection to bypass Pi-hole if they wanted to.
Which would have been blocked, I don't know - probably not since if it knows what it should block, then it will block.
`pihole disable`
Sounds like it's preferring the secondary - probably because it was the faster of the two at one point (e.g: a DNS lookup while the Pi-hole was offline). It'd be best to remove the references to Google's DNS servers.
It depends on the router. Many will do the default behaviour of "use the router as a caching proxy" in which all the requests go through the router opposed to "have the router's DHCP daemon hand out the upstream DNS servers for you".

The former results in Pi-hole only seeing queries originate from the router, while the latter shows the true client IP address.
The debug token doesn't appear to show anything out of the ordinary. Could you provide a screenshot of `ipconfig /all` in Windows please?

Also, is it isolated to just this computer or does Pi-hole also not work on other devices?
From what I've read, It's primarily because the MicroUSB connector is so garbage that it's recommended to power it through the GPIO pins; but the garbage Ethernet driver is also a PITA.
A Pi Zero (with a USB Ethernet adaptor) will fit the bill nicely if power is the utmost concern. My Pi 3B uses <$4AUD in power a year (with the official power supply drawing 1.5w) and a Zero would use less than that.
I haven't been on the PC yet, so my cake day is news to me! :)
Go into Firefox's `about:config` and search for that detectportal string to blank it out.
My list contains all the default lists, with the exception of Steven Blacks Hosts, which is just an amalgamation of lists I already have there (Adaway, MVPS, etc).

Thanks for the compliments! :)
The Tinkerboard according to reviews (over at Armbian IIRC) is panned as "what not to do with an SBC".

Running Pi-hole on a SOHO-type setup (as you've mentioned), you're going to need at least 256MB RAM, 4GB storage (for FTL's long term storage logs) and a 600Mhz ARM CPU.

It'll run perfectly fine on that. The only exception is when you update Gravity and have over 1M blocked domains - Gravity is CPU bound, and takes longer to remove duplicates on slower hardware. Since Gravity updates are automated, this isn't a bit issue though.
There's a thought! I end up settling on [letting people automate updates](https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php) though.
I have a link that provides a text only list, which you can use to `cron`-automate having your lists updated:

https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php
`pihole -q metrics.plex.tv`
That'll deny access to the service entirely though.
> How can I trust a piece of software to respect my privacy in any other fashion if I must resort to methods such as you're suggesting?

In this day and age of "free cloud services", *you* have to be the one to protect your own privacy because *nothing* out there will, unless you have the privilege of being able to rely on open source and/or self-hosting for everything you use.

I block unwanted content via my [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) and I've found that the Plex metrics are already blocked - which doesn't surprise me considering I block over 1.2M domains.
[It sources itself from our official repo](https://github.com/Fourdee/DietPi/blob/master/dietpi/dietpi-software#L4431).
I've heard that the telemetry comes from `metrics.plex.tv`, so you can block that as an opt-out method :)
> metrics.plex.tv

If you subscribe to my [tick lists](https://wally3k.github.io), this is already included :)
**If** the list that O.P. mentioned was an exhaustive list of what they collected, then personally, I wouldn't mind - there's a big difference between "Telemetry we genuinely need to improve our products that's for internal use only" and "Let's get everything we can in order to make a profit off of using third party analytics".

But in this day and age, it's probably used to make a profit off of.

Flush the DNS cache again, take a look on the Query Log, enter your PC's IP address and sort by most recent. That should make it obvious which one you need to whitelist :)
It's not "hacked" if someone's making use of a service that's *apparently* been made available to the public, opposed to someone who has actively attempted to gain access to your systems which you've attempted to safeguard.
`pihole -a -i local`

That'll ensure that no one outside your network can use your Pi-hole.
Check your router and ensure that you've closed Port 53 (DNS), as well as Port 22 (SSH).
I notice you've whitelisted `www.msftncsi.com`. Try whitelisting `msftncsi.com` too, and see how that goes after flushing the DNS cache on the PC.
To be fair, that's not a big concern for a large portion of Raspberry Pi and/or Pi-hole users... but it is an interesting question. I've asked FourDee on Twitter, [and he has recently started putting checksums in the compressed image downloads](https://twitter.com/DietPi_/status/898214996743782401).
Thanks! Though, it's definitely not a little tool any more - there's a surprising amount of work that needs to be put in to make all the bits work!
We don't work off a schedule, so there's no time frame per-se. However, I'm looking to merge and test in the developer branch after the next release if all goes according to plan.
Currently using DietPi on my RPi 3B, and I'm only using 1.4GB of my 32GB Micro SD card.
Hard to say without being familiar with how that router works. No harm in giving it a go though!
Go into your routers management panel and disable port forwarding for Port 53.

I was genuinely impressed by seeing the MacBook's Touch Bar used that way, and was definitely "outside the box" of the sort of entries we expected to get!
If you have access to `iptables`:

    primary="192.168.1.2" 

    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp \
      ! -s "${primary}" ! -d "${primary}" \
      --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination "${primary}"

    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp \
      ! -s "${primary}" ! -d "${primary}" \
      --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination "${primary}"
      
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE

EDIT: This needs an interface exclusion added (`! -i ppp0` for example), otherwise you're making P53 available publicly 
Many routers supplied by the ISP are extremely locked down. I don't suppose you have the option to disable DHCP?
It defaults to off and pops up a giant disclaimer when you go to enable it. I wanted to check it out, but disabled it again after.

I still noted [it kept querying](https://twitter.com/WaLLy3K/status/896586221937319936) `ntd-asus-2014b-en.fbs20.trendmicro.com`, so I wildcard blocked `fbs20.trendmicro.com` with Pi-hole.

If you're using Gigabit Internet, you can pretty much kiss Quality of Service goodbye as the router will need to enable CTF to achieve these speeds.
Basically, any router that has listed compatibility with DD-WRT, OpenWRT (or LEDE) and Tomato.

Terminal access and `iptables` are invaluable.
`addn-hosts` from the [dnsmasq manual](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html) should do this:

`echo "addn-hosts=/etc/hosts.home" | sudo tee "/etc/dnsmasq.d/ita205.conf"; sudo service dnsmasq restart`
> I don't think people would say the same thing if they spent their younger years in a place like Sydney or Melbourne, unless they wanted that rural lifestyle.

I get the feeling that many people are tired of the rat race of Sydney and Melbourne, so are turning to the likes of Tasmania because of reasons like the land being cheaper, the weather being cooler, the landscape being beautiful and to a much lesser extent, a larger FTTP rollout.

Sounds like a good domain to block, if it was still online.
Try deleting `/var/www/html/versions` entirely and revisiting Web Admin to see if that resolves it.
Bingo! Try these:

`sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/versions`
`sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/versions`
By default, no. YouTube serves ads from domains that look very similar to domains which host the *actual* content that you want to see, so like every other blocklist out there, it's up to someone to compile an effective list.

[One individual has done just this](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/adac7982307fec6ee23605e281a57f1a/raw/5b8582b906a9497624c3f3187a49ebc23a9cf2fb/Test.txt), and as a light YouTube user, it's removed any ad that I've come across - but others have reported a few slipping through.

> Raspberry Pis are not software. They cost money to buy and take time to ship. They require additional electricity to function. Installing an operating system, configuring it and securing it requires time and experience (compared to pasting text into a document).

You can host Pi-hole on any modern *nix distro, it's just many people choose to use a Raspberry Pi because they have great user support (there's hundreds of tutorials for getting started with the SD card installation), is a gateway to other cool projects, and costs <$4 (AUD) in power to run a year.

> Routing every DNS request through it incurs a latency penalty, even if it's only a few milliseconds.

`dnsmasq` is the DNS backend for Pi-hole, and is a really handy utility. It'll cache many requests, so something like 30% of all the days requests will come *quicker* because Pi-hole remembered the query from one of your networked devices, rather than it being re-requested from your upstream DNS. Even when you do have to forward a query upstream, as you said, it's a few milliseconds - this ensures that all the devices in your household isn't accessing unwanted content - ads, trackers, telemetry and even malicious domains.

> Unless you really need ads blocked on a bunch of secured devices (and you're willing to put in the time to keep it updated), running a tiny home DNS server 24/7 is probably not required.

The appeal of Pi-hole is that it's simple to install (run the one-liner, follow the on-screen prompts) and from there, it will keep itself updated - doesn't matter if a user was to only use the default ad-serving lists, or [fifty of them](https://wally3k.github.io).

Considering how many people have devices which aren't capable of running browser based adblockers (Phones, tablets, Smart/IoT devices) but all want to serve you stuff you don't want to see, or siphon off telemetry, I strongly feel the benefits outweigh the negatives.

(Disclaimer: I am a Pi-hole developer, but I would have posted this regardless of my affiliation with the project)

Well that seems fine, so I'm not sure why the Web Admin update checker would be constantly checking `api.github.com`. I'll flag it with the other devs to see what they think!
This may be pointing out the obvious, but it depends on other uses of the app. Many people use Discord for it's intended purpose of gaming voice chat, others use it because Slack costs too much to not have unrestricted message archives - so that's a huge user base on its own, and takes nothing for those existing users to join yet another group.
I feel like this sort of universal hometown complaint is on the same tier of "The public transport in my town really sucks!", haha.
Could you run the following command in Terminal and provide its output please?

`cat /var/www/html/versions`
Short answer: no.

This is a list that a user has compiled of all the ad servers they've seen, and have blocked those domains. There will be more servers for different regions, and Google may add new ones as time passes.

For 100% effectiveness, you need a browser based adblocker that can read the entire URL string, and not just the domain.

The guy that posted this list is working on covering more servers. For me (a very light YT user in Australia), its managed to block every ad so far.
`pihole -h` (or `--help`) should get you started! :)

Alternatively, `nslookup doubleclick.net` from the command line on your client computer should return the IP address of your Pi-hole server.
Adblockers have been under attack for years now; this is just another means to an end.

Fortunately, Pi-hole is pretty relentless ;)
Pi-hole doesn't use Easylist, unless you subscribe to the [blocklists found here](https://wally3k.github.io).

I recall seeing the name Chef Koch before (I recall that I was pretty amused about their anti-NSA blocklist), but didn't see these *gists* at the time. I've gone ahead and added them to the Big Blocklist Collection.

TL;DR: Websites like to track you using a method known as [Browser Fingerprinting](https://panopticlick.eff.org/). As I understand it, these blocked sites are ones which deploy fingerprinting in some form or another.
Speaking as a Pi-hole developer: the project uses third-party blocklists, rather than us having to maintain that sort of content ourselves. The likelihood that we'd get a DMCA request to remove an entire default blocklist is minimal, and there's nothing that'll prevent a user from adding their own sources.

Speaking as a Reddit user: I've had great success blocking YouTube ads with [this list](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/adac7982307fec6ee23605e281a57f1a/raw/5b8582b906a9497624c3f3187a49ebc23a9cf2fb/Test.txt).

I should say that surprises me, but I don't think very highly of HUAWEI as it is...
Ugh, ISP supplied routers are always awful because of how locked down they are. I'm glad that I can modify the firmware on my RT-AC68U and not need a modem in between. More customisation, and one less thing that needs constant power draw!
TPG is intentionally cut-rate, and iiNet have had their finances shackled.

In my experience, Internode, *unlike the others* are able to properly provision CVC for their customers and respond to congestion in a timely manner.

I've been on FTTP for a year now, and have only had one occasion where my automated Speedtest picked up that I was <18Mbit on my 25Mbit plan. When I called up about it (after three consecutive days of congestion), they were already aware of the issue and fixed it within the week.

Honestly, I'm pretty damn happy with them.

Personally, I use [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) for adblocking on all my devices and then for the rare occasions where I've broken my PH/OpenVPN install, Firefox Focus can clean up the worst offending ads. (FFF won't catch everything because I don't believe it uses keywords like uBO/ABP does) 

I might be a bit biased, being a PH dev though :)
THIS is the comment I came in looking for!
Regarding logs, I honestly can't say. Why you see it pop up in Web Admin is because (IIRC!) something within the SSH daemon will resolve the IP of a failed login to log the host name, which makes it *look like* your Pi is attempting to contact China.
Oh derp, it was an SSH bruteforce attacking Port 22.

Yes, that makes far more sense with what you were seeing!
I can't tell you anything more based on what you've told me, sadly.

I'm not *great* with the setup of OpenVPN, but if you're interested, you could send me your log via DM (via a non-public pastebin-like link that allows you to delete it when you're done) and I'll take a look at it when I'm at home!
The only time I've seen these Chinese IP's is when Port 53 has been made publicly available - I'd strongly advise rechecking (internally via port forwarding/DMZ, externally via a port check and then double checking both) that your Pi-hole isn't externally accessible.
You will want to open the OpenVPN app up and view the log. You might not be pushing a DNS server to the client:

    push "dhcp-option DNS 10.x.x.x"
Nah, Fibre.
Fair thought! My client would update the second the IP changed (since it was on the router) and TTL was at 5 minutes IIRC.
I wouldn't have thought CF would help (DNS propagates and all), but I can't argue with results! :)
DL6ER raves about it, so I'm pretty keen to run it myself!
A PHP tool that would update the IP in the cPanel account that managed my primary domain.
No, that won't work.
While you probably could have worded the O.P better, I totally hear where you're coming from and will forward your comment onto the project admins :)
I used to have a similar lengthy reconnects with my OpenVPN dialling back to Pi-hole at home, and inadvertently resolved it when I switched my domain over to Cloudflare (and used them to update my DDNS).
Unless you want your battery life to get wrecked, then it's a good thing that it gets disconnected :)

Makes OpenVPN keep a tunnel alive even when the device is asleep.

With it off, it'll just reconnect when the device is woken up.
Seafile seems like a better option! :)
You might want to double check the following setting is off: Settings > OpenVPN > Seamless tunnel
Pi-hole is perfect for this, and to illustrate, we've got a [series of blog posts](https://pi-hole.net/2017/07/06/round-3-what-really-happens-on-your-network/) on the topic :)
OpenVPN used to take up to 10s to connect for me, whereas now it takes 1-3s. I'd suggest trying the following:

* Make sure your OpenVPN tunnel DOES NOT tunnel Internet traffic. By disabling this option, you will still perform DNS requests and also have access to the block page
* Use another DDNS provider. Personally, I switched to Cloudflare (for my primary and DDNS subdomain) and that considerably improved connection times
* Optionally, ensure the OpenVPN server is up to date, and preferably running on something with a bit more power than a Pi Zero
Been on Tomato for QoS, but the lack of updated WiFi Broadcom drivers (and general lack of development) makes me sad. DD-WRT's QoS is gimped, and Merlin's QoS is barely better.

I never did figure it out when I installed a standard (non community) build on my AC68U. Is there a list of common packages one can install somewhere?

With the inclusion of invertebrates in the sub, I expect the bashing of the thing this thread is tagged not to discuss.
Google uses a number of domains to serve ads and you can guarantee that all of them are blocked by the default lists.

You'll have to go through the Query Log and see what else is being blocked (and that you don't have anything like a browser-based Adblocker also contributing).
Yep, you can add an arbitrarily named `.conf` file into `/etc/dnsmasq.d` and add just about any option as per [the manual](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html).

If you specify something that's in one of the pihole conf files, `dnsmasq` will fail to start when you try to restart it.
Sadly, I think it's an *expectation* that *everyone* is collecting and selling user data in this day and age - every company wants to maximise profits, and selling their consumers up the river is an "easy win". Given the question, (an end user isn't generating a level of data that would be worth making a profit off of) I'm going to answer this as if it's directed at the developers.

Short answer: The data that we collect is extremely filtered/limited, and we *absolutely do not* provide this data to anyone outside of the [core team](https://github.com/orgs/pi-hole/people) (let alone *sell* it). We're a bunch of privacy and security nuts that work on this project in our spare time - we care about your privacy, even if some of our users choose not to (e.g: By using publicly available Pi-holes, where *their admins* have access to your browsing history).

Longer answer: As far as personal data from your installation goes, we *only* see uploaded debug logs. Otherwise, we don't have access to the data that's generated by your installation of Pi-hole (and have sub-zero interest in it). This means all the data that you see displayed in the Web Admin (e.g: IP's, times, dates, domains, etc) is yours and yours alone.

There are limited ways we do get information about our user base, but as I've said, it's extremely filtered. Let me elaborate:

* Unique Clones per week from GitHub: We're told how many people have installed or updated Core/AdminLTE/FTL
* Debug Logs from Tricorder: We get a copy of `pihole-debug.log` sent to us when `pihole -d` is run *if* the user opts to upload the log. It's stored for 48 hours, and is *solely* used for troubleshooting. As it stands, we've been working on updating this tool so that it'll provide the user troubleshooting options before offering to upload the log, to minimise the need for us to resolve issues
* Interaction from Social Media: We get stats as provided by Facebook and Twitter Likes/Follows/Interactions. It's up to the end user if they wish to follow or interact with us on Social Media
* People who donate: We attempt to reply to and thank everyone who donates to us, and that's it. It's of course, up to the end user if they want to donate
* Visitors to `pi-hole.net`: We erase the web server logs regularly, and only keep the count of unique views. It's not a requirement that an end user visits our website
* Block Lists: I am in a unique position where I can view stats from people who have opted to use blacklists that I mirror on `v.firebog.net`, which is something I offer in a non-official capacity. To ensure uptime, the lists are cached by Cloudflare (opposed to hitting my web server logs), so I get some limited, but pretty information from the Cloudflare dashboard. What I do get is shared with the team in the following manner:

> Between 16 Jul and 23 Jul, there were 3084 unique blocklist hits, totalling in 11.6GB of bandwidth.
> The top 4 countries were US (32%), GB (17%), DE (12%) and AU (10%).

If we ever need to get another set of information from our users, we'll poll them using our social media channels.

I hope this post is clear, and that it answers O.P's concerns.
`cat /etc/pihole/adlists.list` should tell you!
`wget -qO - https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick | sudo tee /etc/pihole/adlists.list`


Ah, yeah you're right.

Try the `--cname` option instead ([`dnsmasq` manual](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html)):
`echo "cname=salt,docker01" | sudo tee /etc/dnsmasq.d/cname.conf; sudo service dnsmasq restart`
I'm not a fan of short and vague responses (to be fair, I was on my phone at the time!), so I'll take the time to write up some thoughts since this *particular* project is important to me.

I originally wrote the block page back in [September last year](https://twitter.com/WaLLy3K/status/772419036361527297), but due to the limitations of Pi-hole and PHP, the page itself was taking a good 2 seconds to load on my installation - the domain needed to be queried, 3m lines needed to be searched, and then matching results returned to the user before anything could load. The project was extremely helpful in minimising user confusion (instead of being greeted with a blank white screen), but there was a lot of room for improvement.

I was contacted by the dev team so that they could create a derivative of my work, and they end up opting for a javascript based solution that queried the domain after the page had loaded. I totally respect the decision, but I felt that they needed to account for the fact that people use javascript blocking solutions such as Noscript and Scriptsafe. I don't feel it's reasonable to expect users to run javascript on *unsafe* domains, and so the most critical block page functionality *should* work without it (read: everything but whitelisting).

With this in mind, and a bit of back and forth with the devs on a few topics, I decided to join the team to provide optimisations where I could. It pleasantly turned out that I was more than just a one-trick pony, so making the necessary improvements has taken much longer than I expected.

* The `pihole -q` query function needed to be optimised in order to return results extremely quickly. Changes to this function in the next release will mean that most queries are complete in 0.1-0.2s, even with a blocklist of 1.5M on an RPi3
* The block page needed to, and has now been re-styled to match that of Web Admin. It'll also support user-customised translations via CSS, because there's a *large* non English speaking user base out there!
* Administrators need to be able to specify an email address to display on the block page, and this needed to be built into the codebase instead of expecting users to manually edit a config file
* With the block page using PHP, a couple of limitations that "lock down" `lighttpd` could be removed. This means that users should eventually be able to run Javascript on their installations (e.g: [Aria2 WebUI](https://github.com/ziahamza/webui-aria2)), and even secure the Pi-hole Web Admin with Let's Encrypt (especially helpful for those running their instances on a remote server)

Currently, the biggest downside (IMHO) will be that we have no desire to maintain a "database" of blocklist URLs and their classifications, and is something we'll have to revisit at a later time in order to let end-administrators be able to specify classifications themselves.

What all this means is that once my version is officially integrated, I will not be continuing the seperate project. I will however provide removal instructions come the time.
It overwrites it. `sudo tee -a` would append it.
`pihole -a hostrecord` might be able to help:

> Usage: pihole -a hostrecord <domain> [IPv4-address],[IPv6-address]

> Example: 'pihole -a hostrecord home.domain.com 192.168.1.1,2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1'

> Add a name to the DNS associated to an IPv4/IPv6 address
I haven't experienced this issue myself, but you can also try going to the [Pi-hole Admin Console](http://pi.hole/admin/queries.php) and whitelist the most recently blocked sites coming from your PC's IP address!

Ah, you're using the `pi` user which won't have permission to `/etc/pihole`. This should work:

`wget -qO - https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick | sudo tee /etc/pihole/adlists.list`


Looks like you're using Wheezy, which isn't the version of Raspbian that we support. If you're able to upgrade to Jessie, *I expect* that would resolve the issues.
Run `pihole -d` and provide the token you get when upload the debug log, so we can look into it a bit further! 
Fair enough!
In the meantime, you may want to consider an OpenVPN type setup! :)
Yep, that's the aim of [the PR](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/pull/1420)!
If you're using a Raspberry Pi, [this should get you started](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/cron.md) in the right direction!
`FTL` (the daemon which provides the stats to Web Admin) believes that `10.0.0.132` (Your Pi-hole's IPv4) has the hostname of `usc.adserver.snapads.com`, which sounds a bug that had re-emerged with the last release and was squashed in the current development branch.

You may want to try `pihole checkout core development` (you can revert with `pihole checkout core master`) to confirm that the issue will be resolved with the next release.
That..... is odd. I'll flag this with the devs so this can be followed up on.

In the meantime, could you provide the token you get when uploading your debug log (via `pihole -d`) please?
It can definitely be done! I've been testing it for quite some time now, but implementing it *outside* the Pi-hole code base is a serious PITA to maintain.

The ETA is tied to [this Pull Request](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/pull/1420).
Ah! Yeah, you need to automate the process by creating a cron job and use something like the `wget` command I posted above. :)
No, but you can just copy and paste the [results from the tick list](https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick) into `adlists.list` or [Pi-hole's Block Lists menu](http://pi.hole/admin/settings.php).
It's currently not a feature that we're able to support as it'll cause blocked pages via HTTPS to load slowly and spit out errors. We are however working to fix this in a future release!

Sounds like FTL is timing out, and as suggested, the Web Interface should also fail to load stats. Could you provide the output of `sudo service pihole-FTL status`?

`sudo service pihole-FTL restart` might help resolve the issue.

For the average user, I don't think there's much point. The primary Pi-hole will probably only go offline for SD card failures, or power outages.
It's a tool targeted for MerlinWRT firmware users, which being an optimised version of AsusWRT, will primarily only work on Asus routers.

So close enough, really.
Nice find, I've found the list that this is sourced from and ~~will double check everything before getting in touch with that list maintainer~~ have let the list maintainer know about the potential false positive.

[Looks like it won't be removed](https://twitter.com/kowabit/status/893543666752643072).
Interface only has three commands:

* `pihole -a -i local`: [Default] Allow LAN clients to connect at most one hop away (so this usually doesn't work for OpenVPN clients)
* `pihole -a -i single`: Listen only to the eth0 interface
* `pihole -a -i all`: Listen to all interfaces

You'll want to use `pihole -a -i all`, but just make sure your Pi-hole is firewalled by ensuring that Port 53 isn't forwarded, or that it isn't DMZ'd.
It's still updated and maintained. I have a [list of alternative adblocking hosts files here](https://wally3k.github.io), and if one were to go down the route of using a hosts file, I'd highly recommend using [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net).
So there's three types of list:

* Ticked: These are recommended for those who don't want a lot of ongoing maintenance - they shouldn't block anything that people might genuinely use
* Unticked: These are usually "generic" lists that MIGHT block stuff that people would use
* Cross: These are lists that are known to block stuff that people commonly use

You'll want to use the list of URL's that is generated, so you can do something like `wget -qO - https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick > /etc/pihole/adlists.list` to automate it.
Websites are doing this via Telemetry anyway regardless of plugins, but tracking plugins just make it a whole lot worse.

You can ensure no one can track the habits of anyone in your house with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) and some Tracking & Telemetry blocklists.

`pihole -g -f` will delete the cache of your current lists and redownload them, which is the advisable thing to do here.

Sounds like `adlist.list` may have been modified. Run `pihole -d`, let it upload the debug log and provide the token here - it'll let us see if you're running the default lists (and a few other things).
Mostly for ISP supplied routers, and *possibly* for retail bought *if* they have that feature included (I'm not sure on whether it can be automatically configured if enabled).
> but still won't let me add any IPv6 options in the interface

What exactly are you referring to? "Pi-hole IPv6 address" can't be changed without a `pihole -r` reconfigure.
What's anonymity and privacy worth *to you*, and what do you have to lose if you fail? Make a list of your biggest threats, and protect against them.

Some examples:

* Don't want the Government or a state-sponsored actor to know what you do? Tough ask, and requires a *lot* of thought and consideration - more than just "Get Tor, get Signal"
* Don't want to be doxed by people online? Don't post personal information, or even small bits of info that could be used to build a profile of you in a way that's publicly searchable
* Don't want to be tracked? Remove fingerprinting identifiers from your browser and block the addresses of common ads/trackers using something like [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net)
* Concerned about compromised accounts? Compartmentalise the data you provide to your profiles with different usernames, email addresses and other info
* Concerned about compromised devices? Harden your operating systems - this varies depending on what you're trying to secure
How does that test the speeds you're paying for? All this kind of test proves is how good the peering outside your ISP is like.
I feel sites should take advantage of alternative revenue streams. Donate via PayPal/Patreon, or buy products from their store.

I'm not seeing anything that immediately sticks out as wrong in that log, but I do note that there's only 7 unique clients - none of them with a name that would indicate a household computer, laptop or phone.

On your primary computer, could you screenshot the following: `nslookup doubleclick.com`?

Actually, looks like you might have already fixed it via an OpenVPN configuration!
Run `pihole -d`, upload the debug log when it prompts you to, and provide the token here. Should help give us a bit more info to diagnose with!
You should look into increasing the font size to fully use the screen real estate!
If your threat model includes the carrier ISP, run a full VPN to an endpoint that you trust. It'll make you pseudo-anonymous, and if OpenVPN is configured correctly, won't be interceptable unless you're drawing the attention of a state actor.

If your threat model doesn't include the carrier ISP (e.g: Telemetry from apps on your phone), then run a [DNS only VPN](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/OpenVPN-server:-Installation) to something like [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) that can filter known-bad domains, which still lets you make full use of your carrier's upload and download speeds.

If your model contains both, set up a Virtual Private Server with OpenVPN *and* Pi-hole to proxy all your traffic.
[TR-069](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz0SNEFZ8h0) can be compromised fairly easily, and is apart of almost every ISP supplied modem/router. TL;DW: It's a management utility that allows your ISP to remotely change settings and update the firmware on it. This is usually performed over HTTP, and when secured by HTTPS, can potentially still be compromised.

When it comes to third party firmware such as DD-WRT, OpenWRT (& LEDE) and Tomato, I think they're as secure as anyone's going to get.
Try: `> /etc/dnsmasq.d/03-pihole-wildcard.conf` to wipe your wildcards, and then `sudo service dnsmasq start`.

I'm seeing that `03-pihole-wildcard.conf` has an IPv6 address in it, as well as the `/64` CIDR which is an issue we've recently corrected. These things may be causing the DNS server to fail when starting.
Them's some nice looking colouring books.
I have a small 30~ domain blocklist [which I've added to the big blacklist](https://v.firebog.net/hosts/static/w3kbl.txt).
Sadly, neither of these domains are found on the lists that my site links to. As for your other question, we could, but I don't know the best way something like this could be "community managed".
Block first, ask questions later :)
Yet another service using you as the product, and not the customer.
Reddit really messes up the formatting, and makes it hard to read. Could I ask that you provide the debug *token* that you get when you upload your log via Tricorder? :)
`dnsmasq` will treat anything in `/etc/dnsmasq.d/` (ending with `.conf`) as an "override" of sorts, so `01-pihole.conf` will take priority over anything in `/etc/dnsmasq.conf`.
You might want to provide the output of `sudo service dnsmasq status -l`, to better understand why the process is being killed off.
As a person who's always checking out individual blocklists for various reasons, this is something that's bugged me for a *long* time.

The next release will have a feature specifically for this issue: `pihole -q domain -adlist`.

You can see it in action early via `pihole checkout dev` (and you can revert with `pihole checkout master`).
:/ Re-run the installer entirely: curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
Run `pihole -r` and repair, then attempt to run it again.
Odd! Run `pihole -d`, upload the debug log when it asks you to and then provide the token here. If you find you're having issues with the debug tool, run `pihole -r` and repair.

If *that* fails, re-run the installer: `curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash`
Run `pihole -d`, upload the debug log when it asks you to and provide the token - it might help us better understand what's happening here! :)
Go to Web Admin and seperate domains using the space bar. Same goes for `pihole -w`.

As for nothing showing up: the domain is probably already cached. Flush the DNS cache and try to make the ad pop up again.
It's always going to try and phone home (that's the cost of convenience over privacy, sadly), but at least won't be sending anything.
If you've just installed Pi-hole, then yeah that would likely be the issue!
> Blacklisted it immediately and even attempted to deactivate in TV settings but it still is sending.

If you've blacklisted the address, the TV may still have a cache of the old address. Your safest bet would be to do a hard reboot of the TV.
AT&T's firmware is so locked down that you apparently can't even disable DHCP.
DNS traffic is unencrypted, `dnscrypt` ensures the traffic *will be* encrypted - however, it's only compatible with DNS servers that run `dnscrypt`'s server.

[Try this list](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/adac7982307fec6ee23605e281a57f1a/raw/5b8582b906a9497624c3f3187a49ebc23a9cf2fb/Test.txt)
The ads on speedtest.net are primarily Google Adsense, which are definitely covered by default lists.

/u/WhoresAndWhiskey - If they're getting through, you will want to confirm [if QUIC is the issue](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/why-do-i-see-ads-in-chome-but-not-other-browsers/3284).
I run Pi-hole on two Pi's at home (as well as running an OpenVPN server so my cellular usage is covered by PH), but I suppose one could consider my opinion a bit biased since spend time directly contributing to the project.

Honestly: it's been one of the best additions to my network, as it gives the comfort of knowing that the household devices aren't communicating with trackers, or other unwanted servers.
and if you run [OpenVPN](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/Pi-hole---OpenVPN-server), you can be covered while on cellular too!
The token had a typo and was actually `0t7jo1rs2v`

`sudo service lighttpd start`

Try that. If it still doesn't work, provide a screenshot of `sudo service lighttpd status` please!
I'm not too sure about the WAN port bit (I'm having trouble visualising the setup, tbh), but try heading to Tomato's Advanced > DHCP/DNS page, confirming Use internal DNS is ticked and that Intercept DNS port is unticked. Make sure to save!

They're the only two things I can think of that might interfere with Port 53 operation.
I can't say I do, but if you're familiar with creating your own cron jobs, performing this command weekly will do the trick:

    wget -qO - https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=tick > /etc/pihole/adlists.list
White screen, black text, no buttons? Sounds like PHP is not running, but the Web Admin repo could be borked too.

/u/mikeypop, could you run `pihole -d`, upload your debug token and provide it here for us to check?
So one of your concerns is the speed in which blacklisting takes?

I'm glad you've mentioned that it's an issue for you, because I can thankfully say that we've got changes planned that'll greatly improve the speed of whitelisting and blacklisting a site down to 1s with default adlists on an RPi3! :)
You can configure it from the Tomato GUI by heading to Basic > Network > WAN Settings > Type > Static

> Usually, I get my network-related levelling-up faster, but this one just spins my head around.

Happens to all of us, I reckon! :)
I don't understand what you mean by working with the default setting, but that `sed` command will see if the include_shell line exists in the default `lighttpd.conf` and comment it out if necessary.

Hope that helps! :)
It's not "end-user" easy unfortunately, but we are working on removing those restrictions!

Also, sure. I have a cronjob that does it daily:

    # Ensure HTTPS is working for Lighttpd
    sed -e '/include_shell "\/usr\/share\/lighttpd\/include-conf-enabled.pl"/ s/^#*/#/' -i /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
Pi-hole's `lighttpd` configuration really only limits you from self-hosting anything that requires Javascript, and there are issues with running a TLS encrypted webserver. Fortunately, I do have a hack that allows *me* to run both JS and Let's Encrypt:

Firstly, `include_shell "/usr/share/lighttpd/include-conf-enabled.pl"` in `/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf` needs to be commented out, but this gets wiped away with each `pihole -up`. This prevents Let's Encrypt serving your HTTPS cert to blocked domains, which causes browser issues (such as popups on iOS and Mac).

Then from within `/etc/lighttpd/external.conf`:

    # Only enable SSL for primary FQDN (Blocked domains return ERR_SSL_UNRECOGNIZED_NAME_ALERT)
    include_shell "find /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled -name '*.conf' -a ! -name 'letsencrypt.conf' -printf 'include \"%p\"\n' 2>/dev/null"
    
    $HTTP["host"] == "mypi.ddns.net" {
        # Undo Pi-hole Javascript Redirect
        url.rewrite = ("^(?!.*).*\.js$"  => ".*.js")
        
        # Enable HTTPS
        include_shell "cat conf-enabled/letsencrypt.conf 2>/dev/null"
    }

It might not work out of the box for you, but it can give you some ideas at the very least.
Ah, my mistake!

So with the E900, you'll want to connect it to one of your LAN ports and ensure it has a static IP. Then configure your DHCP server (hopefully, a feature you can configure via EdgeOS), to provide the E900's static IP as the DNS server for the clients on your network.

Hopefully that makes sense?
I'd suggest either updating to a MultiWAN build of Shibby that includes adblocking, or [use this script](http://www.linksysinfo.org/index.php?threads/script-adblock-not-so-lean.72290).

It does the same core function that Pi-hole provides by using `dnsmasq` as a black hole.
Generally speaking, these are embedded by the site itself, meaning that you can't block them via the likes of Pi-hole which can only block content based off the domain name.

You'll want to look into adding a browser-based adblocker such as uBlock Origin, which can block content based off keywords.
I'm not versed in Windows Server, so I don't quite follow. Do you mean you're using the server to add your own A/AAAA/PTR records to the DNS for clients on your network?
What's the Windows DNS server actually doing?
> Efficient in that context means that demand is met with an efficient supply. Demand meaning both the want for the service and the willingness/capacity to pay.

This basically sounds like what the *public* would expect the word "efficient" to mean in this context, but it does seem to be in the Liberal playbook to use words vague enough that the public interprets it in one manner, but they mean it in another.

Then when they're called out, they can say "well we weren't *lying* y'know?".
It depends on how you set up the DNS IP's on the DHCP server - you could have the Pi-hole as the first and an upstream server as the second, but you risk having up to 20% of the queries go out via it.

Alternatively, set up a second Pi-hole on a Pi Zero. That's what I do! :)
Smells like TR-069 to me.
* Clients should have their DHCP gateway automatically set as `192.168.1.99` (Win 2003)
* DHCP gateway should be configured to provide `192.168.1.253` (Pi-hole) to the clients
* Pi-hole is configured to hit an upstream DNS server such as Google
* `192.168.1.254` (Billion 7800VDOX) is configured to use the static DNS of `192.168.1.253` (Pi-hole)

I think this configuration should work just fine, assuming the physical network setup involves both the Pi-hole and W2003 servers hanging off the LAN ports of the router, and no VLAN buggery.
Odd, but I can only assume that a list maintainer had *just* pushed an update.
I'd also agree with that, always have the clients connect directly to the Pi-hole DNS server whenever possible as it ensures that the Pi-hole Query Log can easily pinpoint domains to specific clients.
I'm not surprised about the lack of mention of Internode on NBN; any time you do a Speedtest, it registers your ISP as iiNet. That also wasn't the case for me with i'node on ADSL2+.


Some anecdotal thoughts on the matter:

I've been with Internode on NBN fibre for about a year now, and run an automated nightly Speedtest that sends a notification to my phone upon going below 80% of the advertised speed (I'm on 25/5). It's only fired a message on three nights (that were in a row) and after calling customer support to inform them of the issue on a Monday, they let me know they were already aware of it and had ordered extra capacity.

I don't know if any RSP that "automatically" provisions CVC when at capacity, but as far as "reporting an issue and getting it fixed" goes, I'm very happy with Internode.
"Efficient private sector", nice weasel words right there.

What's their definition of "efficient"? "Profitable"?
Yikes, 8880 ad serving YouTube domains! Are these *ALL* confirmed to be serving ads?

You can `/var/www/html/pihole/index.php` or `blockingpage.css`, which will persist between updates.

Just bear in mind that *when* there's a Block Page update in the future, you won't receive it until you delete your changes and run `pihole -r`.
That's a fair argument!
In my case, my home Internet connection is 25/5Mbps, while my cellular network can reach 50Mbps in either direction, however I used to have the same setup when my speeds were 16/0.8Mbps.

If one happens to have better than 50Mbps on their home line, then sure, why not forward all the traffic? :)
Personally, I'd recommend having two VPN's on your mobile device:

* One "full tunnel", to an endpoint overseas
* One "DNS/LAN only tunnel", to your Pi-hole

With the DNS only tunnel, you ensure that you can make full use of the speeds available on your cellular network.
There's interest within the development team to make this, we just need to sit down and figure a way of doing it that doesn't noticeably affect performance - that is, when we have time to dedicate to this feature.
An exact block of `reddit.com` will block this site. A wildcard block of `reddit.com` blocks this site and all of `reddit.com` subdomains.
I'm speculating here, but I personally don't see any reason why the likes of a Raspberry Pi 3 couldn't handle that.

My only thought would be to have a large amount of storage available on it (32/64GB perhaps?) to be able to sustain the FTL long term database with all those client hits. That is, if you don't want to limit the DB size drastically.
Double NAT? That's almost never a good idea.
Just whipped something up for you, since I had some time. When you enter the following into Terminal, it'll auto-install all the blocklists that *are not* marked with a cross. (Other list types are [found here](https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php))

`wget -qO - "https://v.firebog.net/hosts/lists.php?type=nocross" | sudo tee -a /etc/pihole/adlists.list`

The text based list is updated directly from the Big Blocklist every 24 hours.
If you *specifically* want to just deny access via the droplet's IP address, you could do the following via Terminal:

    echo -e '\n# Deny access to Pi-hole Admin via IP addr\n$HTTP["host"] == "192.168.1.1" {\n  url.access-deny = ( "/admin/")\n}' | sudo tee -a /etc/lighttpd/external.conf

Change `192.168.1.1` to whatever the WAN IP is for the droplet, and then run `sudo service lighttpd force-reload`.
No, it doesn't teleport the DNS cache.
^ This.

http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html
> Dnsmasq accepts DNS queries and either answers them from a small, local, cache or forwards them to a real, recursive, DNS server

You can control the caching feature using the `--cache-size` option.
>  If I understand correctly the Pi-Hole should function without a DNS if the cache were sufficient.

The only way it can get a cache to begin with is by querying an upstream server and storing the entry for as long as the TTL allowed :)
> The bandwidth is asymmetrical with limited upstream and up to 1 Mbit/s downstream. 

Sounds like you'd *only* want to use it if TOR or another form of proxy wasn't available.
Strict, short answer: No. An upstream DNS server is always necessary.

The Domain Name System is akin to a giant telephone book that resolves website names to IP addresses, and the entirety of that telephone book is hosted on what's known as a [Root Name Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_name_server).

Pi-hole can only cache a tiny portion of the telephone book, and needs to be pointed to an upstream DNS server to keep its cache current. Even if you were to install your own DNS Server such as `bind`, it still needs to be pointed to a Root Server for the very same reason: to keep the cache current.

If you're concerned about privacy, you can [use an alternative DNS server](http://dnsrec.meo.ws/), and even [use DNSCrypt](https://www.dnscrypt.org/).
^ This, and to elaborate further:

There is a difference between a DNS service, and a proxy service. A proxy service routes EVERYTHING through the proxy (which can get bottlenecked by the likes of Google Fiber), but a DNS service only routes a couple of kilobytes of data for each domain lookup.

Pi-hole is a DNS service, so you will see a *minute increase* of speed because website lookups are cached.

This confirmed something that I had read about a year back, but couldn't find any reference to when I wanted to reference it again. I make sure to turn off WiFi when I leave home, and enable an OpenVPN connection to tunnel DNS queries back to Pi-hole on my home Internet connection.
That doesn't sound good! I've only once contacted NZXT support because I wanted to move my cooler to another motherboard and wanted some replacement double sided tape. They end up sending me that and all the screws/mounting brackets too free of charge, which was nice.
Honestly, I reckon the most likely scenario involves using Zero Days to compromise either of the end devices. Targeted surveillance is "feasible".
I went through two Corsair coolers (H90, I think?) when I upgraded my PC last, and they both had a pump rattle. The Kraken X41 has been absolutely solid.

> CanvasBlocker only affects the hash of the PNG creation, it doesn't affect a WebGL table/technical hash which comes from your GPU/graphical engine/etc. I'm pretty sure that's something we'd have to edit in, for example, Nvidia drivers.

Oh shoot, WebGL. Yeah, I retract my above statement. I use `webgl.disabled` within about:config to disable the readout.

> What do you mean by spoofing your time zone?

If you hit up Panopticlick, you'll notice that if your Time Zone doesn't show as "60" (like with the Tor Browser), then you won't achieve a unique browser tick. I have a Windows startup batch file which simply passes `setx TZ "GMT-1"`, which Firefox will use instead of the system preferred time zone.

~~Use Block Mode: Prevent/Block readout, but also make sure you spoof your time zone, or your bits will stay 15 and above.~~
https://pi-hole.net, which can run on any modern *nix distro connected to your network.
Sure, the average person won't be able to review the code themselves, but it does mean that it *can* be audited by *anyone* at *any time*, like with what occurred with [OpenVPN](https://ostif.org/the-openvpn-2-4-0-audit-by-ostif-and-quarkslab-results/) instead of relying on security through obscurity.
Not just WhatsApp, but Facebook Messenger "Secret" conversations that are based off the [Signal Protocol](https://whispersystems.org/blog/whatsapp-complete/).

I have a firm belief that these implementations are [not as secure as the Signal app](https://whispersystems.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/), and that when formally reviewed, would fail a security audit.

Being closed source (yada yada, Stallman is *likely* right), those who use these apps will have to be content with never knowing what happens to their data once it reaches the server, which basically means that the communication will be able to be decrypted by Facebook and passed onto an agency for an ongoing investigation after a warrant is issued by a (hopefully impartial) judge.

If this can't currently happen, then this is likely what the Government is trying to call for.
> "We cannot allow the internet to be used as a place for terrorists and child molesters and people who peddle child pornography, and drug traffickers to hide in the dark,"

Bullshit, that's a load of scare mongering in an attempt to mislead the public into giving away their privacy and security.

You're telling me that hardened criminals are using the likes of Facebook that require your *real name* to peddle child porn, and drugs?

Anyone using Facebook for these kinds of things are *surely* to slip up because of bad OPSEC since they're using the most popular social media site in the entire world, that's well known for the vast quantities of data they scoop up for marketing and research purposes.

This article also appears to conflate transport encryption (Such as SSL/TLS) with resting encryption (that prevents the server from being able to see the data in plaintext). I *highly* doubt Facebook implements resting encryption, and if they do, they undoubtedly have their own "back door" which allows them to decrypt the conversation. That is what this Government demand would be useful for, meaning that I believe it's already within Facebooks power to do this.

Edit: > I have absolutely no issue with the Government wanting to ensure a flow of information for investigations, as long as the chain of due process involves getting a warrant via an impartial judge, then getting the social media company to provide the data. I DO have a problem with direct Government/Intel Agency access, which could be potentially warrant-less. If this were the case that they're arguing for, I highly doubt the vague term "encryption" would be up for discussion. <

It's like this Government has never heard of the Playpen investigation, Silk Road or, y'know Tor, the so-called "Dark Web", where the real criminals hide on the Internet.

I'm not an expert in this field, and this is all my current understanding. If I've got anything wrong, do let me know.

Let us peruse your phone right now, or we'll stick it in a UFED and peruse the cloned contents for days after the fact.
Look at it like this: do you want to be *completely* unique, or do you want to look like you're a part of a group of people wearing a mask?

The latter is what removing the unique identifiers from your browser can do - but unless you're able to get a <12 bit score on Panopticlick, then don't bother trying to half-ass your anti-fingerprint protection :)

Use Firefox for your daily browsing, and with broken sites, you can have a backup browser such as Iridium with Scriptsafe enabled.
You're right, you can place that under `external.conf` (just change the first line domain so `lighttpd` knows when to override the JS redirect)

You won't need to put everything into /admin/ with this, and putting anything in there is not recommended because it'll get wiped out with any Pi-hole updates.
Yeah, I rely on it every day and have more recently come to help develop it.
Hey, thanks for the Pi-hole shoutout in the survey! :)
I use sync with a local network folder to keep my computers connected, and WLAN sync my phone on the rare occasion I have to update my "common vault".

I too am of the mindset that I don't want cloud subscriptions - both because it locks me into having to pay someone else, and because *I'm* not in control of my data.

Multi-platform, user friendly, open source, allows for local storage and preferably, has been audited. They're my requirements for when I have to move on from 1PW.
Anything sitting in `/etc/lighttpd/external.conf` is going to get read as a standard `lighttpd` config file, and this is some code I use that could help:

    $HTTP["host"] == "mypi.ddns.net" {
        # Undo Pi-hole Javascript Redirect
        url.rewrite = ("^(?!.*).*\.js$"  => ".*.js")
    }

That doesn't look good at all! :)

Feel free to use `pihole checkout dev` to get the version that'll work on your screen, but make sure to revert using `pihole checkout master` when the next update is out!
O.P is using [Chronometer 2 by /u/jpmck](https://github.com/jpmck/chronometer2/), which will likely need to implement a similar fix to what I did with that PR :)
If you add host names to `/etc/hosts`, you need to reboot for the changes to take effect.
DNSCrypt and Pi-hole can be used together (I've seen a few guides floating around), but making it work with a VPN for all connections is a fair bit harder, unless you're running a VPS where you can install it on the proxy endpoint.
I vaguely suspected that it wouldn't work - I'll remember that for next time :)
The default Pi-hole lists don't block YouTube video ads, but [this list](https://gist.github.com/anudeepND/adac7982307fec6ee23605e281a57f1a) may help.
From the debug token:

You should run `pihole -r` and repair the installation.

Extensions, as this article talks about are like "I can fill my 1Password data into Safari", rather than App A has unfettered access to talk to App B.

It's more effective to store data to the Keychain and have another app read that data.
No, the more likely case is that one GApp is storing an identifier in the keychain for others to use.
As /u/wtflinux elaborated on, no. Your browser capable of running plugins is *one vector* that advertisers use to exfil data off your computer.

There's the PC's OS, the software on it, your phone's OS, the apps on it, and even your IoT devices.

I honestly believe [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) is one of the best protections you can employ, and you can even install OpenVPN so you can be protected when you're away from home.
It's trivial for me to find the server IP address and then grab a pretty PingPlotter screenshot, and the time I did, I didn't notice anything unusual - but it could possibly be useful to run a trace alongside packet capture. Kinda pointless though if I have no developer to forward it too, since the issue is *so clearly* not the fault of the player.
You're not inherently made insecure because the flaw does not get fixed, you're made insecure because the flaw has disabled a number of security protections that harden iOS from malicious software such as (IIRC) code signing, and portions of the sandbox.

It's a bit like saying the exploit leaves your front door wide open, allowing for keyless entry into your house. That's problematic, because you are now more susceptible to issues that would normally not affect an iOS user with their "front door locked".

I've religiously jailbroken my 3G, 4, 5S and 6S, but I do not and will not any more. iOS is now a leader in the security field, and jailbreaks are few and far between. The software has become extremely hard to exploit, and those who do find an exploit sell it for mind boggling amounts of money to exploit vendors who then sell it on for *more profit* to government agencies and the like.

The data on your device is an absolute gold mine, and you *need* to protect it as such.

If you want to ensure security, you *need* to keep iOS up to date, never jailbreak, have a passcode that's at least eight digits, only use offline encrypted backups and preferably, look up how to Pair Lock your device.

If you want to ensure privacy, use iCloud *as little as possible* and I'd *strongly urge* you run [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) to prevent a myriad of apps reporting to dozens of trackers that App Store developers embed. You can also run OpenVPN to ensure you have access to it while on cellular.
Moderating can be tough, and there's a particular mindset you need to do the job well and not get jaded by the whole unhelpful <dev team plz fix> or <barely comprehensible wording> crowd.

I haven't seen evidence of it on the PUBG forums (yet), but as a former long term Counter Strike Admin whose RL profession is customer service, I understand their position well.
I've been meaning to do this, but I unfortunately don't have any VPN's that have an endpoint in the same country I live in - but I have suspected that a different networking route may help.

I'll probably end up trying to run an OpenVPN instance off my 4G hotspot and see if that makes a difference, since I have a spare RPi Zero lying around.
There's two distinctly different issues here:

* One is a keybinding issue that prevents people from ejecting, but the plane still moves across the map as per normal
* The other is O.P's issue where the plane is mostly stuck in one position, and more often than not, you can't eject at all

The two keep getting merged into the same topic on the bug report forums, and makes positive troubleshooting [posts like this](http://forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/32482-plane-glitch-rebinding-f-key/?do=findComment&comment=129375) and [this](http://forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/32482-plane-glitch-rebinding-f-key/?do=findComment&comment=134283) harder to see.
With regards to the Airplane laggy/unable to eject issue, [there's been a lot of troubleshooting done](http://forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/32482-plane-glitch-rebinding-f-key/?do=findComment&comment=129375), [and then some more](http://forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/32482-plane-glitch-rebinding-f-key/?do=findComment&comment=134283).

It's not a client issue, it's a network issue (but it's odd, because I can *sometimes* see others 'chuting down) - it affects me on fibre (with <20ms to the Amazon AWS server), even with the PC directly connected, but not when the very same PC is on 4G with a WiFi hotspot. The fact the threads keep getting merged with this keybinding issue has severely reduced issue visibility, as well as being able to keep track of the "me too's".
I feel Tassie is going to get a lot of people migrating from the mainland due to the heat, cheaper land prices, and beautiful landscape over the next 10 years.
If you run into any issues, check us out at /r/pihole :)
Yep, we released a broken update to the development branch - so it was nothing you modified that caused it.
All you can do is just look at other examples of code (*cough* StackExchange *cough*), try your best to understand how it's achieving what it does and then use it yourself. :)
If you've got SSH or HTTP access to a server running Pi-hole, it's pretty trivial to extract data from FTL! What sort of data are you looking to retrieve?
A suggestion on how you could optimise your script to call one subprocess instead of 22:

    exec awk -F '[:,]' '{print \ 
    "DNS Queries Today: "$4"\n" \
    "Queries Blocked: "$6"\n" \
    "Total Domains Blocked: "$2"\n" \
    "Queries Forwarded: "$12"\n" \
    "Queries Cached: "$14"\n" \
    "Unique Clients: "$16 }' ~/.cache/pi.txt

If the transfer closed too soon, then my only thought would be to try again at a later time - maybe the remote server is having issues.
Block first, ask questions later when things break!
If you're using [this third party Chronometer utility](https://github.com/jpmck/chronometer2), you'll want to submit an issue on GitHub about it as that's where the maintainer is assured to see this.
Default password is `raspberry`
`rpi-update` does that, I believe.
As long as you're running Raspbian Jesse and have everything up to date (`apt-get update; apt-get upgrade`), they should swap out just fine.
I run two Pi-holes, one on an RPi3, and one on a Pi Zero. Honestly, the only difference I notice is when running `pihole -g` - removing the duplicates takes longer due to the lesser-spec'd hardware.

A bit annoying when you're updating from 54 different lists like I do, but would barely be considered an issue on a standard install.
I'm aware of the amount of servers we need to keep the project running, but I'm not tasked with the costs or maintenance of them - so I can't answer that! :)
Every donation, even "a mere" $1, matters greatly to us - both motivation to keep going, and the monetary support to keep Pi-hole's backend servers up and running.

Thank you.
I'd need to look into it more, but in theory it shifts the LCD colours preventing the likelihood of them having a persistence issue.
I'm not an expert on burn-in (or more specifically, image persistence), but due to the nature of how Chronometer refreshes (with the screen occasionally going blank in between refreshes), it should *avoid* burn-in. But, this is just behaviour I experienced when developing Chronometer via SSH/PuTTY.

If burn-in does become an issue, it'll be trivial to implement a proper "black screen wipe" every 60 updates or so.
Pi-hole is perfect in this situation, but being a PH dev, my views may be *slightly* biased. :)
It sounds like the device that you host Pi-hole on is not capable of reaching the Internet.

Fwiw: We used to use `netcat` to upload debug logs, but we've recently made it prefer `openssl` instead to ensure transmission integrity.
Wonderful! I genuinely suspect there was an issue with `perl` not being installed, but no matter - it's all good now! :)

Despite it having been brought up a number of times here, it's a bit of an odd one to search for if you don't know what's happening -- so basically, you're welcome :)
[It's Chrome](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=47262&can=1&q=random%20host%20names&colspec=ID%20Stars%20Pri%20Area%20Feature%20Type%20Status%20Summary%20Modified%20Owner%20Mstone%20OS).
This appears to be failing [domain name validation within `list.sh`](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/ecde2225122904a89543712ec8f2b0fd1da26ff6/advanced/Scripts/list.sh#L67), but I simply *cannot* reproduce this with an up-to-date (v3.1, master branch) Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi Zero.

I suggest running `pihole -r` to repair, attempting to reproduce, and if it persists, providing the debug token after uploading your `pihole -d` log. Also, confirm whether you get output from `which perl`.
If `apt-get` doesn't work, are you able to get an IP address when using `dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com`?

See if you can upload your debug log and provide the token it spits out after using `pihole -d`.
Run `pihole -d`, upload the debug log and provide the token here. While you're waiting for a response, try `pihole -g` and see whether that fixes it.
You can pull all sorts of information out of Pi-hole. If you want to know if PH is active, use `pihole status web`. For everything else, look at [Chronometer](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/development/advanced/Scripts/chronometer.sh) (`pihole -c`) as an example.
For me, the positives were:

* Being able to finely tune Quality of Service rules to ensure priorities to types of data on my network (Gaming > Streaming > Web Browsing > Bulk > Cloud Backups)
* Being able to run an OpenVPN server, providing an easy-to-setup GUI so I can access my Pi-hole away from home
* Automate the Dynamic DNS update, to ensure access to the OpenVPN server
* To have access to `iptables` over my whole network
* To be able to actively view how much WAN bandwidth is being used on my network
You can always use `pihole checkout dev` to see it early (comments on it are always appreciated!) and it can be reverted with `pihole checkout master`.
When you say that you can't get it to work, how so? Is there too much text overflowing onto the next line? If so, this is a known issue that will be resolved by the next official release.

If not, hit me up and I'll see what needs to be fixed (if there's something wrong with Chronometer itself).
Suspicious, Advertising, Tracking and Malicious would easily rack up 1M domains.  There was another list that I removed recently that would add about 0.4M. Chuck on Chad Mayfield's porn lists on top of that, and I suspect that you'd have about 3.4M blocked domains.

... and yet, Pi-hole can still handle that with ease!
> Just thinking it's free app's ads/tracking?

Tracking within the iOS App Store (and presumably, Google Play too) is a *huge* business. If you had two or three really active iPhone users, I can totally imagine it racking up a ton of tracking-related hits (especially if you use tracking-specific blocklists).
Nice! I actually think you're the first person I've seen post a picture of what the new Chronometer looks like on their dedicated small screen :D
My lists have been served via HTTPS for about two weeks now (Strict TLS, lists cached by Cloudflare), and it's great that people notice :)
> can also blacklist IP addresses

Pi-hole doesn't provide an IP blacklisting feature, you'd need to use `iptables` on a router to effectively do that.
Try these: https://gist.github.com/anudeepND/adac7982307fec6ee23605e281a57f1a
Putting my old ADSL2+ Modem/Router into bridge mode and putting 3rd party firmware for a seperate router I had just bought was one of the best things I could do for my network.
Some people are happy with the default offerings, and then some people want to [see the advertising world burn](https://wally3k.github.io)!
Ah, random cloudfront domains *usually* are the culprit!
Head to the to Query Log on Web Admin, enter your devices IP address and sort by recently blocked.

You should be able to figure out which site is being blocked by a process of elimination.
It's also an extreme PITA to set up, from everything I've read. If this was available in a user-friendly GUI manner, the likelyhood of people shifting OS would be much higher IMO!
I'm not surprised. Australia does have a penchant for scope creep.
They're already here: http://www.smh.com.au/national/centrelink-hacking-into-fraudsters-phones-20170627-gwzgqc.html

Good thing that iPhones can be pair locked, preventing this!
If you're using Chrome, they use a network stack called QUIC which allows ads to be delivered. You can disable the feature within Chrome's flags on the desktop. /u/telekrmor's link has more detail on this!
Yes, but it's possible to have `sed` strip the colour codes.

I also believe it won't colour itself if such a command is called from `cron`.
Almost ironically, the iPhone is the one device with the technical capability of resisting UFED's - just not out of the box.
The correct command would be `sudo service pihole-FTL restart` /cc /u/F0erster

Give that a go, and we'll see if that solves it.
If you've got spare *nix hardware available (a Raspberry Pi is a solid choice because of abundance of tutorials to get started as well as the fact it uses <$4 in power a year), you can run the installer found at https://pi-hole.net and it'll guide you through the setup process.

From there, you can then head into your router and see if it allows you to change DNS settings to point to your Pi-hole, or if it doesn't, you can enable the feature that PH provides to auto-serve the new DNS settings to the clients on your network.

The latter half can get a bit tricky, but there's always help available over at /r/pihole and [the forums](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/).
There's plenty of helpful people on that sub as well as [the forums](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/) to help you get started! :)
A Raspberry Pi is the *easiest* device to set it up for (there's tons of tuts on how to get started), but Pi-hole works on any modern *nix hardware (capable of running Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian or CentOS)

There's very little stopping you from setting it up in VirtualBox, honestly!
I suspect you must have whitelisted something earlier, but didn't flush your DNS cache. So by following those instructions, the game client could finally see the server it needed to.
It is, but as far as spoofing screen size in Firefox goes, there's few other options.
How hard is it to fix? We need to shift functions from the `lighttpd` config to the block page.
For Pi-hole, you could run the Admin Console on any port, but the Block Page is required to be on 80. You also need to keep in mind that a PH update will attempt to reset any changes to `lighttpd`'s port.

It's not something we support though, and we're working on loosening the `lighttpd` restrictions.
I wouldn't recommend adding *all* of them (there are lists marked with an X that I don't recommend due to some false positives), but the page is done in such a way that copying the groups of URL's is very simple. You can then head to the [Admin Console](http://pi.hole/admin/settings.php), expand "Pi-Hole's Block Lists" on the right and paste the lines in there.
Pi-hole runs `lighttpd` on port 80, and sets the webserver up in such a way that it's not able to provide Javascript to anything but the Admin Console and the Block Page ([this is what causes the issue](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/lighttpd.conf.debian#L65)).

Due to this, Owncloud (and anything else requiring JS) will not work if you want it to also use `lighttpd` on port 80.
If you're having issues with Pi-hole blocking *anything*, here's the set of steps that can ensure you find the right domains blocked:

* Quit whatever application is having the issue. In this case, ESL as well as Steam
* Fire up http://pi.hole/admin/queries.php and leave it open
* Run `ipconfig /flushdns` from the command line
* Open the affected application
* Refresh the Admin Console, and sort by Status so that `Pi-holed` is up the top
* The latest red entries from your PC's IP address will be the ones causing issues. Whitelist each one by one until you resolve the issue (and remove the ones that didn't work), or just whitelist them all.
It allows you to import and export your Pi-hole settings.
Anti-Adblock lists that I know of are specifically for browser based adblockers, and not Pi-hole.

I don't suppose you know of one that's in HOSTS/domains only format?
The issue is in the Tomato codebase, the issue persists regardless of Shibby/Toastman/AT builds. /nitpick :)
It's also great when you [pair it with OpenVPN](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/Pi-hole---OpenVPN-server), as it means you can be covered on your cellular network too.
I took time to despy my installation to the best of my ability. I reformatted my Windows 8.1 install using the very first ISO I downloaded after my purchase, applied all updates and ran various batch scripts which removed all known telemetry updates before the system could reboot (after reboot, comparing remaining updates with those batch files and hiding them) and removed any CEIP related tasks from the task scheduler.

No, what was happening was that Teredo was running as a psuedo network interface and by running `netsh interface teredo set state disabled` (as suggested by a user in this thread that deleted their post), Pi-hole no longer reports `win8.ipv6.microsoft.com` from my computer.

A week later, I can confirm this domain has not appeared again on my Pi-hole log.
We all make mistakes :)
You might appreciate the heads up: formatting of block page has changed, and appears to have broken your code.
Unless you're running a router with third party firmware capable of running `dnsmasq`, then what you're asking isn't possible. It's an "everything or nothing" kind of setting.
I haven't used those options, so I have no opinion to give on them! :)
Sorry to hear that's happened! Making a thread here on Reddit often gets our (the devs) attention, but otherwise, [creating a GitHub issue](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/issues) will directly alert all of us.
If `pihole -r` doesn't work, then I strongly suggest a reinstall: `curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash`
You can manually set the DNS server:

[Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-dns-servers-in-windows-2626242)
[Mac](https://www.lifewire.com/network-preference-pane-change-macs-dns-settings-2260394)
Absolutely reasonable. Sending 2FA tokens via a mobile carrier is insecure - it's been proven the networks can have content intercepted in transit due to lack of encryption, and it's plausible to perform social engineering on a carrier to port away your mobile number.

Plus, I don't need a company having the mobile number I've used for the last 10 years spamming me with promotions. That's why if I'm *absolutely forced* to use a mobile number, I use my 4G Hotspot's number. Via its admin panel, I can receive texts but all calls are dropped.
Google Authenticator was just a suggestion, but Authy is very reputable and should do the job well.

Personally, I have a Yubikey, and store all my TOTP tokens (about 20 of them) on the smart card and use the Yubico Authenticator to provide the tokens when I touch the device.

In the end, it should hopefully mean you don't need a *second* phone, or depending on how Amazon has set it up, *any* phone. :)
From what I'm (skim) reading, that text appears to say you can use an offline TOTP auth like Google Authenticator.

Is that not an option for you?
Don't use the DHCP server feature, and manually point your handful of desired devices to your Pi-hole's IP.
I don't visit a very wide range of sites, but more often than not you can bypass the messages by disabling your browser based plugin as it's usually just picking that up instead.

If the site still complains after that (which some do!), I go find the content I want elsewhere or at a last resort, use a VPN via a browser (Iridium) running Sandboxie on Windows.
Thank you <3
My router has issues declaring a local DNS server via IPv6, and sends all my queries via itself instead. Annoying when you're trying to isolate what device is querying what site.
Without Wireshark logs, it's not possible to make a firm conclusion - but does warrant further investigation (especially considering I disable IPv6 on my network entirely. A Teredo type function built into the Windows network stack?)
In the sticky [Welcome to the Pi-hole Subreddit. Please read before posting!](https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/5rhxre/welcome_to_the_pihole_subreddit_please_read/), there is a link about [preventing ads on Youtube](https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/search?q=Youtube+ads&restrict_sr=on), but the short answer is no: Youtube hosts advertising content on the same types of subdomains that hold actual content - so Pi-hole isn't very effective in blocking YT ads.

uBlock Origin is better in this area, because it's able to scrutinise the whole incoming URL and determine if it's an ad or not, opposed to just the domain name.
> It seems like the manual option would be at least pretty easy, especially if we really only use 5-6 devices

In any case where you have full access to the devices, and we're not talking about say, over 15, then manually setting the DNS server will work as the method of last resort.

However, I'd recommend that if the ISP supplied Modem/Router has the option for Bridge Mode (and nothing else of use, like disabling DHCP), I'd recommend buying a third-party router (preferably one capable of running third party firmware such as DD-WRT or Tomato) which will turn the ISP supplied hardware into a "dumb modem".

Sometimes, you can even ask your ISP to supply you with a Modem/Router capable of running Bridge Mode.

That's a lot of IF's though! Everyone's situation is different, after all.
I've seen this before, where the first entry in the blocklists (`list.preEventHorizon`) was what popped up as the server with `nslookup`.

/u/dschaper, do you recall what caused this, or what the resolution was?
Sounds like it could have been an [odd timing issue](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=+curl%3A+Failed+writing+body&t=ffab&ia=qa), because I've just confirmed that FTL does in fact update successfully. Does the issue still happen if you attempt `pihole -up` a second time? 
> git: command not found

Oh dear. I'd highly recommend re-running the installer to re-download the dependencies: `curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash`
I see this too on my Windows 8.1 machine (specifically, `win8.ipv6.microsoft.com`) and I'm not convinced it's Telemetry.

**Edit:** [Issue is fixed, and the solution is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/6j50am/comment/djdaner?st=J4T0CC39&sh=37269278).

~~I haven't sat down with Wireshark open, but I regularly see random apps like iTunes, or Iridium (Privacy focused Chromium fork) querying that domain from my firewall software. (But, I still block it and doesn't appear to cause any issues!)~~
The SSH password for your Raspberry Pi by default, is simply `raspberry`. If you've changed it, then short of plugging into the device with your keyboard and monitor (assuming it doesn't show you a login), I don't think there's very much you can do.
Apologies in advance, this is going to be extremely nit-picky!

> But you can add another router and use the Comcast router as a modem. 

That's if the Modem/Router device has the ability for bridge mode. As I'm not a Comcast subscriber, I have no idea of what functionality it has. Generally, ISP supplied Modem/Routers are going to be *very* locked down, so you can't merely assume what features it'll have available (including the ability to disable the DHCP Server).

> Or you can configure manually the clients (computer, laptop, phone, tablet) to use the pi-hole as your DNS server, and using de IP from the Comcast router as gateway.

That's the last option we recommend to users, because it doesn't scale when you have to manually alter every computer in the household (and there's some IoT type devices which don't even offer this option).

> Also, you can use the raspberry pi as access point with the pi-hole installed, for turning the rpi in an access point https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md

It's definitely *an* option, but the access point wouldn't be a very large one unless you bought more specialised hardware.

You've pointed out some very valid ways to get Pi-hole working on the network, and that is *fantastic*, but there are advantages and disadvantages for each.

Also:

> I've added Google's DNS servers because if something breaks pi-hole, you can continue using you internet connection.

That's not something I'd recommend. You often won't know if your OS prefers the DNS server with the lowest ping, or attempts to "load balance" queries out between the two. I have two Pi-holes running on my network - one on my primary Ethernet wired RPi 3B, and another via WiFi. With this in mind, I still see roughly 20-30% of the networks total queries get sent through the second DNS resolver
Fair. Perhaps the seedy guy has a Google logo on him leading you to believe that he can't be *too* seedy?
You *may* be able to disable the DHCP Server from your router. Many ISP supplied routers are trash and don't allow to be configured at any "decent" level.
You don't have to install anything from their web store, so a more accurate analogy would be "It doesn't matter how many deadbolts you have on your front door, if you let the seedy guy in claiming to give you free screen savers" :)
Sometimes, we find out way outside the sub to posts like this too :)
It can be run on any Unix-like hardware, but the Raspberry Pi *is* the most popular low-powered and low-cost option. :)
Interesting thought, that! We'd need to parse the output instead of just [live-tailing it on the screen](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/ecde2225122904a89543712ec8f2b0fd1da26ff6/pihole#L302), which would make the function (possibly *incredibly*) more complex. I'll have a look into it and see *if* it's at all feasible.

*Edit: /u/jb_3333 has a similar idea to what I did, so I guess [your wish is my command](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/pull/1550)? :)
To 3.2! :D
Try `pihole -r` and do a repair.
It's something we're looking into, but it isn't merely a simple fix! :)
If you're using a (very) tiny screen that's 17 lines high and 40 characters wide, then this version will no longer display correctly. It was (originally) redesigned to work on screens 20 lines high, and 60 characters wide.
Just your average commute time into Sydney CBD
Apologies to anyone that was using Chronometer on an extra small external screen: we've got changes in place that didn't quite make it in time for this release!
If I understand the spec correctly, NXDOMAIN redirecting is explicitly against spec, whereas DNS Sinkholing isn't :)

Thank you for *using* Pi-hole. The vocal user base is the reason we're so happy to dedicate so much of our free time and energy to the project!
That token was all we needed, and I flagged it for the other devs to review. Thanks!
`dnsmasq` doesn't have [the option](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/dnsmasq-man.html) for NXDOMAIN redirects, as far as I can tell. If it did, then it could be done.

As it stands though, such an option wouldn't be RFC compliant against the DNS spec.
Have you enabled HTTPS on your Pi, via the means of say, Let's Encrypt?

This message will pop up on iOS/macOS devices when the HTTPS server Safari is contacting is using an invalid certificate - such as when `lighttpd` and Let's Encrypt has been configured to send its certificate to blacklisted domains (which is Let's Encrypt's default behaviour).

Right now, Pi-hole (specifically, `lighttpd`) doesn't support having the Admin Console displayed via HTTPS. But, we are looking to make changes to support this in the near future.
Run `pihole -d`, upload your log and provide the debug token - that'll help us try and isolate what's happening here!
You're also freakin' great. 😊
It doesn't *need* to MITM encrypted content though. As per my example, DNS is *not* encrypted and can provide a much broader picture of surfing habits compared to "mere" metadata. (Unless you were to say, use `dnscrypt`)

My final point of my previous post still stands true.
[Disney's Circle device](https://meetcircle.com/circle/tech-specs/) uses ARP spoofing to filter a persons Internet connection by (if I recall) pretending to be the router. Using this method, you could potentially run a DHCP server to serve out a local DNS cache, which can then log all the addresses that your devices are connecting to.

Never just plug a piece of hardware onto your network without first understanding what it does.
Hopefully your experience with Pi-hole is smooth sailing from here :)

But if you do have any issues though, you're totally welcome to hit up /r/pihole if you haven't already!
All good, I actually felt bad at first because I didn't see it pop up on my phone 20 minutes earlier :P
Hey mate,

You'll need to copy/paste the individual URL's and either place them within `/etc/pihole/adlists.list`, or add them via the [Admin Console](http://pi.hole/admin/settings.php) to the section on the right under "Pi-Hole's Block Lists":

    https://hosts-file.net/grm.txt
    http://sysctl.org/cameleon/hosts
    http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.txt

Hope that helps!


Do you have a Chromecast and confirm whether this change interferes with its functions?
I very rarely alter the lists, but I can definitely take that suggestion into consideration!
Share what, exactly? I run [all the lists found here](https://wally3k.github.io), and without directly pointing fingers at certain list maintainers, [the changelog is found here](https://github.com/WaLLy3K/wally3k.github.io/commits/master/index.html). 
> Still. isn't it strange that all the requests to those .local domains are coming from my one work computer?

I have no hands-on experience with Chromecast and the like, so honestly, I couldn't tell you for sure.
Oh! Well, it is expected that FTL needs to be stopped while `pihole -up` is grabbing the new FTL version. Is everything working now though?
What you're seeing then is expected behavior then! :)

If you go to [Admin Console Settings](http://pi.hole/admin/settings.php) > API > Top Lists > Top Clients, you can add the addresses listed in your screenshot to not have your dash flooded with these frequent and noisy requests.
Do you have a Chromecast (or the like) on your network? I see these GUID style addresses when Google services are in play at home.
Pi-hole and a browser based plugin are perfectly complimentary for each other.

Pi-hole will prevents ads from ever reaching *all* your household devices, and uBlock Origin collapses the holes that are left behind on devices capable of running a browser based plugin.

I run the following filters, to prevent minimal overlap with Pi-hole's efforts:

* My filters​​​​​
* uBlock filters​
* uBlock filters - Badware risks
* uBlock filters – Privacy​​​​​
* uBlock filters – Unbreak
* Adblock Warning Removal List​
* Anti-Adblock Killer | Reek​
* EasyList​
* uBlock Protector List​
* EasyPrivacy​
* Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List​
This is accurate \^. I run all the lists on my Pi 3B to get a better understanding of what gets blocked, and a few other development-related reasons. I don't have any issues with regards to DNS lookup speed, and find that I don't come across many false positives now that I've dropped one particular overzealous list maintainer from my list entirely.

You could try the quick fix of `sudo service pihole-FTL restart`, but I'd be interested in having your debug token if you were to run `pihole -d` before that!
I would strongly suggest flushing your browser cache, as the graphs not rendering correctly is a different issue :)
Aw man, but we've had compliments on how good displaying it like that is :P

Basically, it looks like `pihole-FTL` has died. You could try a simple `sudo service pihole-FTL restart` and see how that goes!
Do you want to have Pi-hole just be enabled for certain periods, or are you looking to block specific (e.g: time wasting) websites during certain periods? I suspect the latter, but I'd like to clarify!

If it is, then there's an idea that I *should* take some time to play around with. I also recommend posting this as a votable feature request in the Discourse forum.

With your Android devices not realising something is unblocked, you need to clear the DNS cache. Generally, toggling WiFi will do the trick.
I would look up "Securing open resolver with iptables" and see what hardening guides you can find. [This is a start](https://strongarm.io/blog/secure-open-dns-resolver/).

I use OpenVPN+Pi-hole on my residential connection on my iPhone, and it works really well IMO.
It would make sense if there were *multiple* PS4's that needed to be updated, as Squid caches content.
Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS and Debian are the distros we officially support.
It's not about saving a dollar or two, it's about blocking advertisers that fill my screen with stuff I'll *never* buy, trackers that want to market my usage habits and drive-by malicious content from all my household devices.
It can, but you need to set up [OpenVPN](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/Pi-hole---OpenVPN-server) first. I use this daily on my iPhone.
It uses the same concept, but appears to be specific to Android.
0 in 10 smartphone apps share your data with third-party services with /r/pihole installed, when made to block tracking companies.
I wasn't aware of that context, so fair enough!
It's probably just a smiley face, just like how you see J in certain emails (Wingdings).
Safari's extension API is really garbage at that kind of thing right now (High Sierra may amend that with the WebKit anti-tracking implementation), but Pi-hole with [tracking specific lists](https://wally3k.github.io) has you covered!
If it ain't marketed as such, then it doesn't do that thing at all; doesn't matter if you're taking about the living space of chickens on your carton of eggs, or the privacy of your technology.
Correct, using your WAN IP is expected behaviour.

If you want to be covered by the pseudo-anonymity of a VPN, you would need to have it installed on the server end; this is possible if you're running a VPS where you have full control over the server.

I haven't heard of someone with a setup where the Pi-hole at home connects as a client and tunnels to the server to perform its tasks.
Looks like PHP isn't installed, which is a bit odd! Could you run `pihole -d`, upload your log and provide the token it gives you, please?
It's also an issue for Android (they get you to unlock your phone then make a backup of it) and I don't know of a way to prevent that.
A locked device only gives up a limited amount of information (evidently, not enough for the FBI), and you can't get all the data off it without unlocking the phone and authorising the pairing prompt.

This method I linked to prevents the pairing prompt from ever popping up, and therefore allowing one to make a full backup of the data on your device.

Jon Zdziarski specialises in this exact subject, so his blog makes for a good read.
Yes, this technique absolutely will work on an encrypted device, but as I understand it, the amount of information that the gives up depends on whether the device is unlocked.

The only defence against this (for iPhones at least) is to [pair lock your device](https://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=2589).
I had the same block of text, except it matched 6 participants for 0.36%.
No can do. Instead, [I offer this](https://i.imgur.com/1ZuMORo.jpg).
That is an.... interesting choice of an analogy.
* Micro SD card of a reputable brand for storage (4GB is going to be plenty for a headless setup, unless you have a use case that would make use of more)
* [Micro USB Ethernet adaptor](https://www.amazon.com/micro-usb-ethernet-adapter/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Amicro%20usb%20to%20ethernet%20adapter), **OR** a [Micro USB adaptor](https://www.amazon.com/Apapter-Conventer-Connector-Adapter-Android/dp/B01KSYVPC4/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&qid=1496881445&sr=8-13&keywords=micro+usb+adapter) and a standard USB Ethernet adaptor
* A contingency for handling when the router shuts down or reboots: either an external power supply for the Pi (so it keeps working between power cycles), or a cron script to run `sudo halt` on the Pi from the router.

Running two Pi-holes is pretty overkill, and I'd only suggest it to those who need *guaranteed uptime* if the Pi goes down, or are tinkering with the primary Pi-hole in such a way that things could break (i.e: development).

You will also want to consider running [OpenVPN](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/Pi-hole---OpenVPN-server), so that you can be protected by your Pi-hole when you're away from home.
Ah, so you're looking more from the angle that you want to make use of `lighttpd` for something other than Pi-hole, rather than adding a new feature into the Pi-hole codebase. That makes sense!

Given your use case, I'd create a simple PHP file within `/var/www/html/` (which retrieves the latest WiFi password via your preferred implementation) and displays it nicely using HTML+CSS. This can then be displayed on a nicely sized screen, with a big font that can be read from across the room. It also doesn't need any modifications to `lighttpd`, and will persist between Pi-hole updates.
Lightly rules can easily be made, as we support changes made to `/etc/lighttpd/external.conf` between upgrades.

What sort of feature did you have in mind, if you don't mind me asking? (We're always open to PR's if it's a useful feature!)
You're **absolutely right**, but contextually speaking, it was irrelevant to the conversation for me to say "But they all do this!".
From what I've read, the main OwnCloud devs walked out to create NextCloud, so it sounds like it'd be the better service to roll if you were doing it from scratch.
The point of the link is that your iCloud content can be accessed by the authorities, which is a thing that the more privacy conscious among us should be aware of.

While O.P's link is merely speculation, the blog I linked to is from a well renowned security researcher who often speaks from his own personal experience and therefore cannot cite other sources.

By extrapolation, what I linked to doesn't prove what happened in the first article, but does make it *plausible*.
Also be aware that iCloud is [Warrant Friendly](https://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=5900).
You could also try ripping out the colour ink, but some printers fail to work even when presented with B&W only prints.
Password security is something that's taken as a joke by so many Australian institutions. "Maximum 8 characters", or "You can only use the symbols '!@#$%'", "Our passwords aren't case sensitive, for convenience", "we'll only use the first X characters of your password", or "Let us deliver this one-time-password via SMS".

None of these are secure, and it's such a pain in the arse to find out any information about this *until* you become their customer.

I just want to be able to use my 16-22 character unique pass phrase, and have 2FA via Google Authenticator-like offline tokens. Better yet, let me use my FIDO U2F smart card.
We were made aware that there was an Amazon AWS outage earlier, which would have affected updating Pi-hole (as GitHub host content using AWS).
You should have the text up the top of the query log that says:

> Recent Queries (showing all queries within recent 10 minutes, show all)

Show all linking to what I just gave you. If that's not there, I'd suggest running `pihole -r` and perform a repair.
You may want to consider bookmarking [http://pi.hole/admin/queries.php?all](http://pi.hole/admin/queries.php?all)
These are updated once a week, assuming the remote server is online:

* http://v.firebog.net/hosts/HPHosts-exp.txt
* http://v.firebog.net/hosts/HPHosts-psh.txt

I'd strongly suggest moving back to the original server copies once they're back online, because that's how you show the list maintainers your support. These links may also not be available at their current location in the future, so please keep that in mind.
Within Admin Console, there's a checkbox in settings under Privacy mode on the right, that says "Don't show origin of DNS requests in query log". That provides the opposite to what you want, where requests for each site are shown but not the device it came from.

With it the other way around, that would make it rather hard to determine what website has been blacklisted, and therefore how to go about whitelisting it.
I can't speak for Android, but toggling WiFi or putting Airplane Mode on for five seconds flushes the cache on iOS.
That site will show the values as it's using client-side CSS media queries, but they can only be reported back with Javascript.

RAS won't change what you see on that site, but does fool the likes of Panopticlick.
Honestly, I can't decide if ISP's decide to remove features like alternate upstream DNS servers and disabling DHCP truly because "no one uses them", or if they're just trying to spite the power user crowd.

ISP supplied modems and routers are good for one thing only: landfill. If that isn't an option, then I'm sure it makes a good frisbee for your favourite dog.
Youtube ads are a hard one to block, because the servers that provide ads are "mixed in" with the servers that provide the video that you went to watch.

You can check out [other posts on the topic here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/search?q=Youtube+ads&restrict_sr=on), but the long and short (as I currently understand it), is that you can't block them *effectively* with Pi-hole.
As long as it can run a fairly modern Linux kernel (4+, which includes the likes of Ubuntu 17, Debian 16, CentOS 7, etc) and doesn't have restrictive embedded services, then you're golden.

So for example, I can't run it on my Tomato Router because its kernel version is 2.6.
There's three possibilities that I can think of:

* The DNS cache wasn't flushed, so old entries to known ad-servers persisted
* You filled in the secondary DNS server on your Android, and so it's choosing to use that server instead
* [QUIC](https://blog.brave.com/quic-in-the-wild/) is more widespread on Android devices than I expected
Pi-hole is a DNS cache, which works by comparing known bad hosts via community made blocklists, and "black holing" them.

You have a Linux server device (Typically a Raspberry Pi, but can be a spare laptop, a computer with Linux in a VM, etc) connected anywhere on your internal network, and by pointing the clients on the network to use that local DNS cache, all your devices will be covered - including those mobile apps which have ads built into them that generally aren't covered by browser based adblockers.
By default, Pi-hole has lists that are meant to cause minimal fuss for new users, while uBlock lists are a lot more fleshed out. Still, the two work well together because uBlock will remove the white space from websites where the ad used to be.

You can check out [more lists here](https://wally3k.github.io).
Pi-hole didn't work when you set the DNS server on your Android device?

Basically, what have you done so far? :)
If you've got time and patience, you can even set [Pi-hole via OpenVPN](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/Pi-hole---OpenVPN-server), ensuring your mobile devices are covered when on cellular too!
> I don't think the screen resolution can be hidden? However having a normal screen resolution and size of the browser window will make you less unique.

No, but you can use something like [Random Agent Spoofer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/random-agent-spoofer/) to spoof the most common resolution of 1920x1080. As far as I'm aware, the size of the window itself can't be reported back unless you have Javascript enabled.
Now I may be oversimplifying this, so forgive me, but let me explain more about what Pi-hole (both the program, and us, the organisation) is able to see:

Pi-hole uses [a program called `dnsmasq`](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) to perform all of the work that you see as "adblocking". 

Clients (such as your computer, laptop and phone) are told to use the Pi-hole as their DNS server - DNS being simply the "translation" of changing a hostname such as `reddit.com` back to an IP address, such as `151.101.129.140`.

This means that Pi-hole is able to see what clients are accessing what websites, but not see any of the actual *content* of that page. So, I wouldn't be able to tell if you were browsing /r/pihole, let alone any other subreddit. The same goes for every other site on the web, unless you happen to be browsing something like `suspicious_tumbleweed.tumblr.com`, where the destination is *extremely* obvious from the site that's being requested.

All the content that `dnsmasq` processes gets put into a file found at `/var/log/pihole.log`, and is basically this sequence over and over again:

    Jun  2 18:07:42 dnsmasq[23601]: query[A] g.redditmedia.com from 192.168.1.2
    Jun  2 18:07:42 dnsmasq[23601]: forwarded g.redditmedia.com to 8.8.8.8
    Jun  2 18:07:42 dnsmasq[23601]: validation result is INSECURE
    Jun  2 18:07:42 dnsmasq[23601]: reply g.redditmedia.com is <CNAME>
    Jun  2 18:07:42 dnsmasq[23601]: reply reddit.map.fastly.net is 151.101.81.140

This content gets parsed by a program we've built for purpose called [`FTL` (or "Faster Than Light")](https://pi-hole.net/2017/01/10/coming-soon-to-a-pi-hole-near-you-ftl/), and then gets spit out onto the Admin Console, which can be protected by a password.

You have the complete knowledge of knowing that your Pi-hole installation is your own, and you can read the source code on GitHub to verify that. We, the developers **do not have any information sent back to us from an installation**, with one single exception: if a user opts to upload a debug log to the [Tricorder server](https://pi-hole.net/2016/11/07/crack-our-medical-tricorder-win-a-raspberry-pi-3/). (We also get some stats about unique downloads back from GitHub, but it's pretty meagre).

Even then, we only gather as much information as we need to diagnose an issue, and unless you've heavily customised your installation (e.g:, unique blacklist URL's, custom `lighttpd`/`dnsmasq` configuration, that kinda thing), then we have no way of identifying the debug log until a user provides us with a matching token, which is then deleted after 48 hours. We don't use this data for anything else but the sole purpose of troubleshooting an issue with a user.

We're a bunch of privacy and security nuts, and we deeply care about your privacy and security regardless of if you do too or not. :)

> If it's looking for updates like ring doorbell I'm OK with that.

I know you're using this as an example, but I *really* hope that isn't the case.

The way email works is a good example of how it should be done: You've got Push and Fetch. Fetch will poll the server for updates at every specified interval of time, and retrieve the results when updates are found (which is what the August door lock could be doing here). Push means the client always has a connection open, and the server pushes the updates as soon as any are found.

There are very few good reasons that an IoT device needs to make constant DNS lookups, IMHO.
You can kind of already do this for free with the likes of [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net). It involves running a DNS cacher on a device within your house (such as a Raspberry Pi), have a DHCP server auto-assign the Pi's IP to your devices and then use blocklists to deny access to all trackers. Then using the Admin Console, you can view the top advertisers and the IP's requesting access to it.

Using OpenVPN and some port forwarding, you can have that protection available when you're out and about too.
I respect that you source content from multiple sources. My theoretical ultimate iOS block list would involve automatically getting every list I know of, find the top 2000 of the most often seen domains and push changes to a GitHub repo once every month. That way, you don't burn out from having to maintain stuff manually (because seriously, screw that), and you stay within the restrictions imposed by iOS.

https://filterlists.com appears to be the site you had in mind, and I gotta say, it looks really solid!

A small word of advice: I block 1.6M domains using a Raspberry Pi, and almost all my false positives are sourced from [this guys list](https://github.com/eladkarako/hosts.eladkarako.com), so you'd probably do well to avoid it :)
Do you source your lists from primary list maintainers such as MVPS, Cameleon, Someone Who Cares or HPHosts? (A larger list of sources I'm familiar with is [here](https://wally3k.github.io))

If you don't merely "copy" another HOSTS list, what's the sort of process you go through to verify that a site should be blocked?

How often does your list update?

What is your criteria for having a site blocked, as well as unblocked?

These might seem like odd questions, but ultimately, I'd just like to judge how reliable and unique your list is!
That's disappointing to hear, because I've always had an extremely good experience with Internode on both my ADSL2+ and FTTP connections.

I called up about FTTP congestion three days after it started to occur (my automated Speedtest picked it up and logged the dates) and it was fixed within a week.

Sure, I shouldn't have to do my own monitoring, but none seem to - at least Internode listen though!
Those are some decent suggestions. Here's a few more:

* If you have access to a Mac that you trust (and preferably, sync with), [pair lock your iPhone](https://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=2589) to prevent USB communication with any other computer
* Disable Touch ID when in a position where you could lose your phone, or be in any way coerced against your will to unlock it (e.g: Travelling overseas)
* iCloud is [warrant friendly](https://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=5900), so be fully aware of the content you sync with it - consider disabling photo and backup syncing
* Make a calendar entry to make an encrypted backup of your phone to your computer every month 
* [ENABLE 2FA ON YOUR APPLE ACCOUNT](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204915)
* Disable WiFi when out of the house. Your device can be tracked by any access point, even when you have not connected to it as it's claimed that MAC randomisation is broken in iOS 10
* Run [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) with an OpenVPN instance set up (routing only DNS/LAN queries so you can still use full LTE speeds) so that trackers within apps can't report back to mothership. Consider [adding specific blocklists](https://wally3k.github.io) too!
Then I'm sure you're familiar with *[The Pain](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080907185220/metalgear/es/images/b/bc/The_Pain.jpg)*...

That is, if The Pain was a man made of oxidised copper and a tendency to die for no foreseeable reason.
Almost always a sign of poor testing and design by developers who work in conditions with near-perfect Internet uptime like fibre.

Come down here to Australia, I'll show you what backwater Internet connections look like with your standard 5Mbit down, 0.6Mbit up ADSL2+ here that's offline any time it rains!
I think some of that is an inherit issue when you believe that saying that goes along the lines of "when on the road, watch out for *every other driver*"
If I recall correctly, there was an updated version of Bytafont (a beta on their official repo?) that resolved this issue.
https://twitter.com/mygovau/status/679119222501335040

Solid piece of advice, that ^^/s
This ^

We, the Pi-hole devs, *never* recommend opening up Port 53 because of amplification attacks, and also because of how easy it is to find open resolvers via SHODAN.

If one doesn't know the risks/consequences and doesn't know how to best secure their DNS resolver via `iptables`, then they really should just stick to using OpenVPN (only routing LAN/DNS requests) with it. :)
All three of these are [found on this list](http://v.firebog.net/hosts/static/SamsungSmart.txt), though that list can, and probably will make your TV "dumb" :)
You're searching for Moatads, so it looks worse than it is. They could be reading a backlog on their favourite site, which uses that specific advertiser.
With a VPS, you could set up OpenVPN and only have it redirect DNS queries, providing you with content blocking *and* still use the full speed that Celluar/Coffeeshop WiFi provides you.

I use it with my iPhone and my Pi 3B on my home Internet connection.
While `dnsmasq` is indeed the backbone of Pi-hole, there's a lot that goes into making content blocking a user friendly experience.

Having said that, I do understand that you're trying to point out that there's other options - one may be able to use [something like this](http://www.linksysinfo.org/index.php?threads/script-adblock-not-so-lean.72290/) with AsusWRT-Merlin.
Here's the main ones that I use, that are all E10S (multi-process) compatible:

* [CanvasBlocker](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/): Disable the HTML5 canvas as a means to fingerprint you, but allow sites to be whitelisted (e.g: iCloud). Configure block mode to use "block readout API"
* [Cookie AutoDelete](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/): As suggested by /u/jakethepeg111, it performs the function of Self Destructing Cookies, and is E10S compatible. Make sure to enable "Active Mode"
* [DecentralEyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/): Javascript libraries such as jQuery and Angular can be used to track you, so this will host a local version (which has the added bonus of sites loading marginally quicker!)
* [HTTPS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/https-everywhere/): Certain sites have HTTPS compatibility, but don't enforce it. This user-maintained database ensures you use HTTPS whenever available
* [Smart Referrer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/smart-referer/): Firefox has built in referrer settings, but this plugin configures it all correctly for [ip-check.info](http://ip-check.info) (Configure the mode for "send nothing as referrer, look like direct hit")
* [No resource URI leak](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no-resource-uri-leak/): Deny resource:// access to Web content
* [NoScript](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-uS/firefox/addon/noscript/): (Alternatively, use the javascript manager of your choice)
* [Privacy Settings](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-settings/): Alter Firefox's built-in privacy settings easily with a toolbar panel (I use Full Privacy, but manually enable `dom.storage.enabled`, `dom.indexedDB.enabled` and `dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled` because of sites like Twitter and GitHub)
* [U2F Support Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/u2f-support-add-on/): If using a U2F device such as a Yubikey, this will allow it to be used on certain sites (except Google and Facebook, not that those matter here)
* [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/): Use this over regular "uBlock", as it's the original and receives ongoing support

I also use [Random Agent Spoofer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/random-agent-spoofer/) to set my UA to Win FF 45, block plugin readout and spoof screen size to 1920x1080, but it's not E10S compatible.

I'll also make an honourable mention for [Privacy Badger](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/), as it's good, but I replace it with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) and [a ton of blocklists](https://wally3k.github.io/).

The last thing is Time Zone spoofing - all of this is pretty useless without it. I have a Windows startup script that sets `setx TZ "GMT-1"` for me, which won't affect the OS's time, but Firefox will listen to.

With all this, I get 12.03 bits of identifying information on Panopticlick which is "your browser has a non-unique fingerprint".
We try and give as much time as we can spare to the project, but sometimes the more technical questions do go by the wayside - especially if it's something that one, (say, me with PiVPN) doesn't have experience in.

Hopefully you get your issues sorted :)
While that's a valid troubleshooting step in some cases, it's totally overkill here. You can flush the DNS cache on the iPhone simply by toggling WiFi off and on, or by enabling Airplane Mode for 4 seconds and disabling it.
OTP's via mobile is such a bad idea. Just give me the option of an OTP via an offline mobile authenticator, or better yet, U2F.
Why limit yourself to ad blocking on just one device? /r/pihole
If you have any issues in the future, head to /r/pihole - us devs always keep an eye out on it! :)
At the risk of going along with your straw man fallacy, I'm going to ask: do you have a source for the first part of your statement?
They're two completely different issues, IMHO.

If you wanted to use the slippery slope fallacy to argue that gay marriage will lead to polygamy, I could understand where you're coming from. The issue is between *consenting adults*.

Bestiality is closer to pedophilia: you're taking advantage of something *that cannot consent* with an informed mindset.
> Sex acts with animals are legal in Canada, so long as there is no penetration involved, according to a surprise ruling issued by the Supreme Court. 

Is there any evidence to back up that one is the result of the other? Especially when they go on to say (Emphasis is my own):

> "This **much-needed bill** updates the animal offences in the Criminal Code,"

While I don't have any facts to back up this line of thinking, I would suspect there's another systematic issue happening here if the law needed a much needed reform on bestiality.
*BUT MUH SLIPPERY SLOPE FALLACY TO BESTIALITY!*
A Raspberry Pi 3 with the official power supply uses 1.5w on a power meter reader, which is under $4AUD in running costs *per year*.

The zero might draw a little less, but the biggest bottleneck is the inefficiency of converting AC to DC.
Not sure if pun intended.
There are people that do this already, but take into consideration:

* You don't tend to know what block lists people have installed. If something you need is blocked, what recourse do you have?
* The Pi-hole admin can see all the sites your device visits, so you better be sure they're not looking, or don't care
* Is their installation secure? DNS amplification attacks are a big issue, and can potentially take the server offline - leaving you without Internet.
You can also use an [OpenVPN server](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/Pi-hole---OpenVPN-server) and just route DNS queries, so that when you're on cellular, you're always covered.
Some great information you've provided there, so thanks for that.

Give this a go, and provide the information from where it unexpectedly quits:
`curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | sudo bash -x`
[This guy](https://github.com/chadmayfield/pihole-blocklists) has you covered for porn blocklists, and for gambling, you may want to [check this out](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/tree/master/alternates/gambling).

I don't use either of them, so I can't make any claim as to the quality of those lists.
Pi-hole can definitely do that kind of blocking, as long as you can find block lists that cover, say, porn and gambling.
If by filtering, you mean *actively changing the contents of a webpage*, then no. You may want to consider something like [Privoxy](http://www.privoxy.org/), which can alter HTTP page contents on-the-fly.

Since you're looking at OpenDNS/Norton DNS, you may just wanting to deny access to specific websites entirely. In that case, Pi-hole is definitely a good solution to consider!
I was going to ask about the power requirements of the netbook, but I'm pleased that you've already covered it! :)
Fair enough :)
Out of interest, what projects are you using that would conflict with Pi-hole?
Your Pi-hole upstream DNS server is another device on your network? No wonder whatever's hitting msftncsi is losing its proverbial!

I'd recommend changing your DNS servers and confirming that your clients are using the Pi-hole as their DNS provider.
As this is an issue relating to `curl` rather than Pi-hole, you may want to try [steps listed here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24611640/curl-60-ssl-certificate-unable-to-get-local-issuer-certificate#31830614).
Out of interest, how many characters wide can that screen display, and how many lines tall?

Y'know, for development reasons!
I think that answers it then, it's legitimate and nothing needs to be done :)
Mortal Kombat X did that IIRC
Thanks for the debug log. I do notice a few issues:

* Pinging `172.17.7.1` and `8.8.8.8` shows results of around 2000ms, which *isn't good*
* PHP is complaining about the time zone. You may want to confirm that it's configured correctly on your CentOS install
* You have four `easylist.to` lists within `/etc/pihole/adlists.list`. These aren't in a Pi-hole compatible format, and can cause unexpected issues

See if you can resolve those issues, then run `pihole -r` and select Repair. After that, we'll see if we can reproduce the issue!
That's an issue with development, management and deadlines.

Previously, thorough QA needed to be performed because on un-networked consoles like the PS1 & 2, you only had one shot to get it right. Now, it's "patch it post-release".
Chrome is attempting to see if you're using a Captive Network (i.e: Login before you can use the net), and also sees if the DNS server you're using redirects non-existing queries.

As I'm on mobile, I don't have something to link you to in order to confirm it, unfortunately.
Your quickest-to-reply DNS server is almost universally your ISP's server.
Do you access your Pi via a dynamic DNS name, e.g: `mypi.duckdns.org`?

If so, it's possible your router isn't performing NAT Loopback. You could trace route your dynamic DNS name to learn more.
Since you're using DD-WRT, you *may* have the option for "use internal DNS" (Tomato has this feature under Advanced > DHCP/DNS). If you can disable that, the underlying system *should* just forward the IP address of the Pi-hole to the end clients which will resolve this issue.
> Now, recently with in the last month or so my [] android GS7 has been [] get the ol Wifi signal with a exclamation point inside of it

It's quite likely that your Android device is attempting to communicate with a blocked domain, to be able to determine online connectivity.

Put your GS7 into Airplane mode for 10 seconds, connect back to your WiFi, check out the [Query Log](http://pi.hole/admin/queries.php), filter by your GS7's IP/hostname and sort by status. One of the most recent "Pi-holed" domains should be the connectivity test.
Pi-hole has the ability to run a DHCP server, which will provide the correct DNS server to the clients on your LAN.
I haven't had much spare time on my hands over the last couple of days which means that unfortunately, the debug log deleted itself after 48 hours.

I'm still happy to take a look if you have the time to upload another one and provide the token for it.

Sorry for the inconvenience!
If you're on the development branch, make sure you use `pihole checkout master` as the current dev branch causes issues with the block page.
You can walk into a T-Mobile store and get a SIM with a data/tablet only plan for your phone for really cheap. Last I checked, AT&T didn't allow this.
It looks like you're using Chrome. Google is sneaky and developed a protocol called QUIC to serve ads, among other things. Head to `chrome://flags/` and disable it.
The browser should already be converting IDN's to punycode, meaning that Pi-holes underlying systems just handle the punycode domain. Ergo, a block list with a punycode domain will cover you.

We've also added the feature in the development build to convert an IDN to punycode when searching via `pihole -q`.

Since I'm on mobile, I can't select or read that link. Will have to check that out later :)

> personally i recommend a third party router in all networks as generally the ISP provided router/modem combos are shit. 

QFT.
If `dnsmasq` has that kind of feature, we'd definitely want to make use of it. As you've said though, there's no evidence that such a feature exists.
Yeah, that's right. None of them do, and YouTube is just tricksy when it decides to show an ad or not :(
Simply: we all were wrong :)
Yep, both ways is how it should work. Glad it's working for you! :)
Advanced Tomato is a prettified version of [Shibby's Tomato fork](http://tomato.groov.pl/), which is what first included as a stock feature.

It does the job nicely, but if you load it with over 400K domains, it tends to take down the built-in DNS server because of memory allocation issues. :)
That was behaviour was true as of 3.0, but it created a security flaw that was corrected with v3.0.1. Ergo, `pihole -a -p hunter2` is the expected and working behaviour if you want to change your Admin Console password to `hunter2`.
Having my lists be served over HTTPS is definitely on my todo list, but due to the way it's setup, it's not as simple as running Let's Encrypt on the host.
Booyah! 👊
Alternate title: How the common person has freely given up their privilege of privacy for "free services", while the rich and powerful use it to conceal their business practices.
While I don't regularly use YouTube and therefore can't confirm anything, I suspect [QUIC](https://blog.brave.com/quic-in-the-wild-for-google-ad-advantage/) may be the issue for Chrome.
You're absolutely right. You can work around this using `pihole-FTL version`, but we'll need to make sure this issue is sorted out on our end.

Thanks!
I suspect default block lists should cover some very common trackers, but I haven't ever thought it necessary to verify this. The first three entries listed under Tracking and Telemetry [here](https://wally3k.github.io) are your best bet for culling the trackers.
Redirecting to 0.0.0.0 is marginally faster if the host file is used directly on the operating system, but has considerably less support (on older OS's) than 127.0.0.1.

Pi-hole will parse the lists by stripping 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1, so there won't be any issues with duplication.

> Because I didn't know how things work.

That's totally fair enough, and great that you thought to ask! :)
0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1 serve the same purpose, and the two entries you've listed there are a "Hosts File" format.

The last one is a "domain only", which is all Pi-hole actually uses from a Hosts file list (and redirect it to your Pi-hole's LAN IP).

Why would you like one site to redirect to 0.0.0.0 for?
I don't *think* I know any list that blocks iCloud or Apple. Purely for my own curiosity, could you run `pihole -d` so I can take a peek at your adlists?

(You're totally welcome to decline! 🙂)
*Plugs phone into bench* WOULD YOU LIKE THIS COMPUTER TO ACCESS YOUR PHONE?

Uh. No thanks.
I've got two iPhones, one iPod Touch, one iPad and one MacBook in my house. Despite all of that, I don't see more than a maximum of 350 requests per hour between my two Pi-holes.

I'd force restart each of them (Sleep+Home for 10 seconds), to be honest.
That doesn't sound right. What device is it coming from?
https://dnsleaktest.com

It's also possible you're leaking your IP via [WebRTC](https://diafygi.github.io/webrtc-ips/)
It's "perfectly normal" if you have an Apple device.

I've counted over 140 different Apple domains within my Pi-hole, and most of them are numbered between 1 and 50.
> The main reason for doing this was so that if the RPi2 went down, adverts would still be blocked.

That's a good reason for running two. I regularly do development work on my primary RPi 3B (which has its own dedicated power supply) and if something goes disastrously wrong, there's the Pi Zero backup running a fresh install of RJL off my routers USB port.

Using SSH, SCP and an [passwordless SSH key login for the Zero](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2)
on the primary Pi, I can sync the important bits to the Zero using a cron job:

    # Perform maintenance on secondary Pi if online
    pi=$(timeout 0.2 ping -c1 10.0.0.3 &> /dev/null && echo "0" || echo "1")
    if [ "$jd" -eq 0 ]; then
      cd /etc/pihole/
      ssh -i /root/.ssh/id.pi "pi@10.0.0.3" "[ ! -f '~/pihole' ] && mkdir ~/pihole"
      scp -i /root/.ssh/id.pi adlists.list *list.txt setupVars.conf *.domains pi@10.0.0.3:~/pihole
      scp -i /root/.ssh/id.pi /etc/dnsmasq.d/03-pihole-wildcard.conf pi@10.0.0.3:~/pihole/03-pihole-wildcard.conf
      ssh -i /root/.ssh/id.pi "pi@10.0.0.3" "sudo mv ~/pihole/03-pihole-wildcard.conf /etc/dnsmasq.d; sudo mv ~/pihole/* /etc/pihole"
      ssh -i /root/.ssh/id.pi "pi@10.0.0.3" "pihole -g"
    fi
Consider adding some ticked *advertising* lists from https://wally3k.github.io :)
Lots of block page hits will cause it, I've found, because of CSS resources and such.
That doesn't sound good! Re-run the installer and you should be given the option to repair.
It won't work with ports. Maybe you could implement a `lighttpd` configuration via `/etc/lighttpd/external.conf`, if it just works via web browsing.
Since it sounds like you'd want a setup with *minimal* whitelisting intervention, I'd take a look at the ticked lists [here](https://wally3k.github.io) (Specifically: Advertising, Tracking and Malicious) and use them instead of the default "generic" ones.

It's what I'd do if I was running an "unmanned Pi-hole".
Go back through your Query Log and see what was hitting it at that time. You could also view `/var/log/pihole.log` manually, but it might not make a whole lot of sense.
When your Pi is off, any devices that use the Pi for DNS resolution will no longer be able to browse (unless there's a second DNS server as a backup, but this isn't always advisable because sites that should be blocked sometimes slip through).

The most unreliable thing about the Pi is an SD card. Get something reputable like a Samsung Micro SD card, and you should be golden. (I use 8GB Samsung MicroSD cards in my Zeroes, the baby blue colour ones)

The default white lists have minimal false positives, but it's still best to be around for a week where you can "train" your whitelist for the most commonly used sites.

I think it's a great idea, but I'm of the mindset that this sort of thing should be discussed about first so people are aware of why they're suddenly seeing a block page on sites that used to work.
