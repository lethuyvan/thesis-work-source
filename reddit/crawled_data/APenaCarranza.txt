Superman and Captain America. But I’m actually more interested in th Clark Kent and Steve Rogers interaction than I am for their alter-ego interaction. 
Venmo and Square don’t work in Canada. PayPal does, but I’m hoping for something integrated like Apple Pay Cash soon. 
No worries, and good luck. 
I lived at home in first year and the entirety of my undergrad for that matter. I’m from and live in Hamilton but my commute is still about 40-45 minutes by bus. 15-20 if I drive. 

I’ve had friends who commuted from Burlington in first year and it would take them just as long and sometimes less time to get to campus if they drove or took the Go bus. 
I can’t wait to have it (not in Canada to the best of my knowledge, or at least where I am). My friends and I always take turns buying movie tickets and this would make paying each other so much easier. 
Not soon enough
That is a good one. So good, I made it my flair awhile back. 
I would say no if I didn’t end up needing it myself at one point. Now I say yes when purchasing anything as expensive or more expensive than an iPhone. 

Never thought I’d need it, but one day a blue line appeared through the middle of my MacBook screen and if I didn’t have Apple care it was something like $560 (could be remembering wrong but it was very expensive) to fix.

I get the move. But he was just starting to get it going it seemed. Also, he was getting inconsistent starts which doesn’t help him either. This has to be a blow to his confidence. 

However, the bullpen has also been overworked. The starters have been pretty bad lately so adding an extra arm could be useful for a bit at least. 
No

Let me clarify. I have never, nor will I ever find Scott’s tots annoying or cringey. I love that episode. The only two moments where I felt an ounce of cringe throughout the entire series was when Michael is telling Jo Bennett about all the different plane tickets he’s reserved to go down to Tallahassee but then she yells and then during the finale episode when Meredith is dancing with her stripper son. 
I picked him up for my fantasy team. Been a solid addition so far.

Well this fan-cast of mine goes back several years.  I’m talking at least 16 years. At a time it made a lot more sense. But even still...

I voted for "Ellie" but please know I meant Nellie. 
The whole mouth thing could be because we watched an English dubbed version instead of the intended Japanese, but yeah, the overall animation style wasn’t for me. 
I always assumed the same as your husband tbh, but thinking about it, it doesn’t seem in Jim’s character to discuss personal things like that. 
I’ve had this happen to me too before awhile back. I was sitting in class and got a similar text asking who I was and why did I just call them. I said I didn’t, screenshotted my call history showing that I didn’t call them, sent it to them and then they sent a screenshot of their call history saying that I did call them. I assume scam callers somehow use existing numbers to call other people. 
I’m just about halfway through and I can confidently say that no, I do not like it. I’m not a fan of the animation style and the voice acting (mostly for Batman) really bothers me. I get what they were going for but it sounds bad to me. Wasn't a fan of the actor when he voiced Batman in Arkham origins either. Probably the only thing I didn't like about that game.  

I’ve never been a fan of anime though in general so that could be why the animation style is not for me. 

Also just no to everything about the Joker. 


EDIT: How could I could forget to mention my least favourite thing of all, and that's Bane. Why? Just why?

I like the overall look of this design, however I was never a fan of the helmet. 
I found it kind of dragged on, but the seats there are much more comfortable than Rogers Centre (at least where I sat) so I didn’t mind sitting. 

I didn’t drink when I was there to be honest, So I can’t speak to that 
I don’t know if I can comfortably say that Justice League completes the Snyder trilogy. 
I went to it last year! Honestly, it was alright. I don’t think I’d go out of my way to go for Star Wars night again. They play homemade Star Wars videos between the innings, I assume it’s the stadium staff in the videos. It got kind of old pretty fast, but it’s for the kids more than anything. They sold cheap light up swords for kids to wave around. The kids in front of me were pretty annoying with theirs not gonna lie. And then at the end there was a fire work show. I didn’t stay for that either, figured I’d beat traffic if I left early. 

They had a cool Jaba the Hutt jersey that they wore and I think you could buy it as well. 

I thought some sort of giveaway could have been cool, but it was AAA after all. 
I seriously do not understand the amount of hate this episode gets. I understand when people say it’s cringy, but I think that’s the point. To me it’s cringy but also really funny. I love this episode
I'm also running the latest updates on my iPhone 7+ and MacBook Pro. I never experience the issue on my phone, but it does still happen on my MacBook. Like you, I don't experience the issue in group chats, just 1 on 1 conversations. 
This is the one that I went ahead and got too. Ideally I would've gotten the Fabok one but I couldn't get my hands on it. However, I really like this one. The background colours really pop. 
Even though I'm not the biggest flash fan, he is the casting in that movie that I'm the most sad about never seeing. 

I don't know that this is the subreddit you're looking for... 
What happens with Solarte when JD comes back though? You can’t take his bat out of the line up. I mean for all we know, JD comes back and hits everything, but we’ve already seen that Solarte can produce runs. Will Solarte become the everyday SS and Diaz will get less playing time?

Yup you are correct, my apologies. Fixed it.
I’d say Nate. Really underused, but loved every second he was on screen. 
Not in a movie, no. But in the Batman: Arkham Knight game, the first time Man-Bat appears. Scared me silly. Same with the first time Joker appears in that game too. 
Pretty sure Snyder confirmed that it’s just been abandoned since Bruce’s parents were killed. So it’s just been wasting away. Bruce has been living in that lake house that Thomas Wayne had built for Martha Wayne.

I use it everyday, everywhere. I don’t know about the rest of the world, but in Canada (at least where I am) they accept tap to pay almost everywhere. So I can pay wherever they accept tap even if Apple Pay is advertised. 
It’s the first episode. How can you say this whole season sucks?  

Chill. 
Batman is crazy strong, yeah. I thought you were asking about if just a random person in real life got attacked though. I'm sure there are fighting styles out there that teach that.

I took your question as, if there was a person found themselves in a fight like this in real life, would they stand a chance without any sort of training, sorry. 
I'm leaning towards not possible... In the fight you've mentioned they kind of all wait their turn to attack Batman. It's choreographed. I feel like in a real fight, there would be no waiting on the thug's part. They'd just attack as a group. Also, these guys have knives, so in real life, definitely no possible. 
BEEN there 
I find it best to use google chrome when opening them too. I normally use safari on my computer but whenever I need to see a PDF I use chrome. 
I think this episode had one of Steve Carrel’s finer acting moments too. Went from silly Caleb Crawdad too serious in an instant when yelling at Jim that they needed this game, and then back to silly again. I really appreciate that scene. 
I’m a bigger Batman fan (in fact he’s my favourite) but no. I always like Superman as the leader  
Thanks for posting this. Glad I wasn't the only one. 
Wow, this is the worst lmao.
I don’t get the hate around Scott’s Tots! I find that episode hilarious. 

But mine is Gettysburg. I’ll watch it, but it’s probably my least favourite episode of the entire show. 
Best rebirth book out there right now in my opinion. I didn’t like I Am Gotham either and actually considered dropping Batman and keeping Detective Comics. However, I ended up enjoying Batman far more than Detectice Comics after I Am Gotham. 
It was a code for UltraViolet and then it plays on Flixster video. All of my DCEU digital codes brought me to UltraViolet. 

And yeah I tried turning on subtitles and nothing happened. 
That seems to be the consensus. However, I don’t understand how it would happen. It’s literally edited into the film. Like the text isn’t just subtitles that someone forgot to add in. The text would’ve actually been in the screen edited into the film. 
It’s the one that came with the Blu-ray steelbook. It’s on flixster video
I mean I don't really have a strong preference. But I've also seen the movie a few times where it's had the text and know what he's saying at this point. And just by what Diana is saying, and how she replies, it's easy to know what he's saying anyway. But for someone watching for the first time, I would imagine it could be confusing. I plan on watching it with my parents who haven't seen it yet using the blu-ray tomorrow, so I would hope the text appears there. 
Yeah see, here is a screenshot from a random movie website after she says “i need to speak to you” 
There’s white text

https://i.imgur.com/XQMIVW7.jpg 

Now here’s a screenshot from the digital version that came with the blu-ray of the exact same moment 
No text at all, just a black screen. 

https://i.imgur.com/FNegsUc.jpg 
Here’s screenshots from the scene, they’re kind of hard to make out but they’re around the 38-39 minute mark

Screenshot of her staring at the black screen 

https://i.imgur.com/XvsF78S.jpg 

And this second one in particular is hard to see but she just said “I need to speak to you” and then Cyborg responds but you just hear the robot/alien sounds while she stares at the black screen. I destinctly remember there being text on the screen when he responds to her. 

https://i.imgur.com/POtxoGA.jpg 
Yeah, I mean in the scene (if you're familiar with it) she's looking at the footage of Victor in the lab with his father. Then the screen goes black because Cyborg has hacked it and initiates conversation with Diana. When I watched it in the theatre I remember his questions and responses popping up on her screen in text form that she's looking at. However, on the digital version she's just looking at a blank black screen instead of looking at and reading his words. He is talking but it sounds like computer or alien sounds rather than his actual voice, and I remember in the theatres his words being transcribed onto the computer screen.

He literally didn’t say he would. He said he’s open to all roles thrown his way. 
What bothered me that episode is that she’s really good at volleyball, went to a volleyball camp, (maybe she said she went to college and played, can’t remember), but in the job fair episode at her old high school, she says that she would fake pms to get out of playing volleyball every chance she got (and all other sports). 

Side note: I love Charles! That was probably one of my favourite *minor* character. 
Love reading the comments to these videos whenever the official Justice League twitter tweets them out. 

The responses are always so thought out and original. 
This is the one that I often look at to remind myself. His performance in Good Will Hunting is one of the reasons why it's in my top 10 movies of all time.

I got into the DCEU with the announcement of BvS at comic con. That announcement was freaking amazing. 

Then after it was announced I went back and watched MoS for the first time and got mad at myself for never watching it or experiencing it in theatres. I wasn’t a huge Superman fan so I never felt the need to watch it. I was wrong. Honestly they may not all be the best movies, but each one (aside from suicide squad really) has kept me pumped for this universe. I can’t wait for Aquaman!

Love MoS, Love BvS extended edition, like Wonder Woman, Justice League is ok, I like it, but there’s a lot of problems, Suicide Squad I don’t really like. I find it boring and the only part I look forward to is when Batman confronts Deadshot. 
You're not wrong
I've hated a different character every time I've rewatched. Nellie and Cathy are consistent, however, Meredith is up there. 
I don’t like season 8, but I actually really enjoy season 9. I really liked the addition of Clark Duke. Also, I think Nate is a really underrated character and I don’t think he had enough good moments. But the moments he had in season 9 were great. 
Nah... Nellie or Cathy are far worse. 
Arkham origins is probably my favourite suit, but I'll always love his simple grey and black suit as drawn by Jim Lee in Hush. 
Well, Pete wasn't there when Gabe was so he probably wouldn't know about that one. And judging by her reaction to finding out Andy dated Angela at one point, I would assume she doesn't like talking about her past relationships, or anyone's past relationships for that matter. So Pete really would have only witnessed her relationship with Andy.

Really depends on the artist/art-style. I like Alex Ross' art for covers or posters, but his art isn't my favourite when reading an entire book. I'm not the biggest fan of the realistic look approach in comic books. However, I do think that Ian Churchill's art is great. Specifically that image you posted. Doesn't look too realistic, but you can still tell that they're wearing fabric costumes. The realism of Alex Ross' art throughout the entire book is probably one of the only things I don't like about Kingdomcome.  


The Avengers was good, and it works in the universe that was established. But having him come in and try and make an “Avengers style” movie out of characters that were established in a Snyder-verse, if you will, just doesn’t work. We go from Batman almost killing Superman to him being a joke. We go from Wonder Woman being a badass warrior to being nothing more than eye candy essentially. 

It just didn’t work. I’m sure he’ll have success again, but I just don’t see his style working in this universe. 
Anyone with amazing eyes willing to type this out?

I imagine it would stay. I never re-took the class I withdrew myself from, but you can retake the class. So I think that class would just be on your transcript twice, one with the W and the other with your letter grade 
There’s a certain period that you can drop class until without penalty and without reducing your GPA. It will be marked as ‘W’ (for withdrawn) on your mosaic transcript. 

For example, if I were to be doing poorly in a class this term, I have until March 16th to drop it without penalty. And yes you can take it during a following semester if it’s offered. I’ve withdrawn from a class once myself.

It's my favourite one, but no I don't miss it. I like the evolution it's made. 

I do miss the BvS Batsuit though... 
No, unfortunately it doesn't look like it. Based off of images of police cars from Man of Steel and Justice League. I got really excited though. I mean it could be, it looks very close. And who knows, maybe they're just using a different design.

I get that, but once the Parademon explodes it’s no longer a threat and Batman just leaves? Like no call to the GCPD, no tying him up or anything? 

It’s just strange to me. No justice was served. 
That’s true. I figured if he was a cop they were just trying to stage the crime. Idk it was a weird scene when I think about it. I get that at that moment the Parademon is a bigger threat, but once the fight is over, Batman just leaves as if that guy didn’t commit a crime... 
I like it because Batman isn’t blue af in this.

Superman’s mouth was a mess throughout, but the only time it really bothered me and took me out of the scene, was right at the beginning. I couldn’t believe how bad it looked. In the first scene of the movie nonetheless! But the rest of the time I was able to look past it. 
lol yeah
Great Bruce Wayne overall, alright Batman. I would say he was a good Batman for what Nolan was going for, but overall, just alright. 

Favourite scene was the beginning of the Dark Knight when he glides down the parking garage and lands on the hood of the van.

The only casting choice I didn’t like in Fant4stic was Miles Teller. It was a really odd choice. He probably would’ve made more sense as the Human Torch, but even then, he’s just an odd choice for that movie. 
Why don’t you call your service provider and ask? Or go in store? 
Who is that? 
No, you’re right. 
Freaks and Geeks count? Also Band of Brothers. 
Drop it off at the Royal Botanical Gardens (if you can of course)! They need old Christmas trees.

They’re accepting until January 12th. 
I like your point about the city of Gotham. That was one thing I really didn’t like in the Nolan trilogy. I feel like it was really only “Gotham-esque” in Batman Begins. The rest of the movies it just felt like any other city. 

Unpopular opinion, but I think Joel Schumacher did some things right and one of those things was his Gotham city. At least the small amounts we saw. The architecture, the people, everything looked good (for the most part). 

So I’d agree, I’d really like a great Gotham City. The sad part is, I think Zack Snyder could’ve put together a really great and accurate Gotham city, so it’s a shame he more than likely won’t have any input on that movie.

I haven’t read any comics with him as a member, but in the Justice League War animated movie, only Cyborg knows he’s a kid. So maybe they have agreed that it remains a secret. 
That criticism about Ottawa Street is fair. The main entrance is pretty bad. But I really enjoy the atmosphere upstairs. 

I do miss the old Ottawa Street Tim’s from time to time. 
Favourites are definitely Ottawa street store number 1, and the one on Dundurn beside McDonalds

Least favourites: Queenston by the McDonalds on Nash, Kenilworth Ave, Centre Mall on Barton Street

Mine is also Jared. I don’t know what it is about him. Probably just because I like Zach Woods’ awkward performances. I really liked him on the Office too as Gabe. 
That’s true 
Maybe Wrigley?

He is a minority owner I believe. 

A few notable people have minority ownership. Another more notable one is Rob Gronkowski.

Sure, here’s one from my favourite Christmas movie 

https://i.imgur.com/5F6h6sX.jpg 
Barry said he hasn’t fought people before and is still relatively new to his powers, Wonder Woman could hold her own for awhile anyway but Superman will still come out on top, and Aquaman would put up a good fight, but he’s not beating Superman. 

I also read a lot of comic books. 
INQ Chat 3G. Terrible phone, terrible build quality, terrible OS. Everything was just so bad. 
I love the film a lot. Does it have a chance? Sure. Do I think it should be nominated? I wouldn’t be mad, but I think if a CBM is to be nominated, Logan deserves it way more. Do I think either SHOULD win? No. 

I’m not going to root against either though. It’s good for the genre. 

Just my opinion. 
Wouldn’t be surprised if he actually harassed THE Marco Polo at this point. 
Ok. 
This is dumb. 
My two favourite things, Batman and baseball. Can't wait!
Buy a can of compressed air 
Could have some lint or something jammed in there. Try cleaning it out if this is the case.

Isn't she the current leader of the Teen Titans?


I haven't read Teen Titans since before New 52.
Batman has been really great. The only arc I didn’t like was the very first one. 
Batman 36

Why “can’t” you? 
Nah.. not feeling that. Granted, that just looks like Affleck’s cowl so that was made specifically for his face/head. I’m sure something made to fit Gyllenhaal’s face would look better. 
Captain Marvel is better 
Just to clarify, this is the sister in law of Toronto based artist Francis Manapul. Jim Lee was sharing Manapul’s Instagram post. 
Man of Steel 2 deserves to be on there.. Bummed Nightwing isn't there either. 
Kevin Conroy reached out to him this morning too. 

Superheroes are real. 

Edit: As has Mark Hamill 
Didn’t it start in a garage? 
Didn’t it happen when he went to meet up with Gordon on the roof of the GCPD with Wonder Woman and Flash? 

It was for like a split second, but I’m pretty sure he was standing on the gargoyle before he jumped down. 
Ahh excellent! I’ve been trying to make one for Batman 36. It wasn’t going so well lol. 

Thank you! 
I’ll admit, it really threw me off. I didn’t care for it at first, but then reminded myself that this isn’t the main continuity. It’s actually cool that writers can make creative decisions like that. 
I really loved this book quite a bit. Also, that might be my new favourite cover. 
I don’t think it was a nod to that...
Regular suit in BvS is my favourite. Although, I do prefer the JL regular suit’s cowl. 
True, didn’t think about it that way. Thanks for the insight! 
Batman Who Laughs was really good. I did also really like Doomsday Clock 1. 
What do you mean? 

https://i.imgur.com/J7zeD5q.jpg 

https://i.imgur.com/uuj06Wi.jpg 
If I remember correctly, both Bale and Nolan didn’t want Robin in these movies at all. So I was very surprised (and pissed) when they pulled that Robin bit at the end. Maybe it was just to make some people happy. 
IGN is trash.



But give Tom King an award for Mister Miracle please. 
Pass
Batman for sure. As a kid Batman the animated series and Batman and Robin (I know... but I give that movie credit as it was important to my childhood) were all I would watch. He’s still my favourite to this day. Also, my brother and I bond over the character. While I’ve stayed a DC guy my brother is more of a Marvel fan. However, Batman is a character that we can both talk about together and never get bored. 
10/10 would buy. I've realized recently that a lot of what I like about different Batman stories is Robin (the various versions, but mainly Tim and Dick Grayson).
Not Batman and Batgirl  👀 * eyes Bruce Timm *

But I've always liked Batman and Catwoman.
It's hard to see the detail, I had to really zoom in. Other than that, it's a nice design. I think because it's simple and there's not much going on like the Nolan-verse suits. 

That being said, I also prefer the light grey. I have never liked black or darker grey suits. 
Ah ok, I came to this sub to find out if Canada was getting screwed yet again. Thank you for confirming. 

I was trying to figure out how to set up apple cash but no luck. Now I know why. 
Exactly. Heath Ledger is the joker I think the majority of people believe is the best live action joker, but I’d argue he’s least comic accurate. 
Don’t you think by posting here that you’ve just invited all those that you meant to keep out though? It’s cool that you’ve made another subreddit, but I just don’t get this post. 

I enjoy the JL, BvS and all the other films. But I’m not going to leave this sub because I don’t want to see people’s opinions. 
I was at the game where he hit the walkoff homer against Cleveland. Great memory. 
I've been so hyped and pumped for the DC streaming service, but I have the strongest feeling that it's only going to be for US residents... 
It is really cool. I think it's more the bow staff than anything. Although, I'm sure every Robin has used one at some point. I'm just most familiar with it being Tim's weapon of choice. 
That's actually really cool.

Reminds me more of Tim Drake, but I dig it.

The one with the guy holding the sign that reads "THE END IS HERE" is the main/regular cover. 
What? 
The button? I got mine at my local comic book store. I would imagine any comic book store that got the first issue of Doomsday Clock in also got some buttons. 
I heard a lot that people thought he was the weakest league member in the movie too. I would argue that Aquaman was the weakest and then closely followed by Wonder Woman in my opinion. 
I remember going to that theatre a lot as a kid. I was 12 the last time I went. The last movie I saw there was Star Wars: The Clone Wars movie. 
Got a picture?

I have the lenticular cover and it says 00111
Not hate, but I don't care for, Rick and Morty. Also Game of Thrones. 
https://i.imgur.com/ly0WI2Y.jpg 
Got to my comic book store just in time to snag a lenticular cover. Only 1 left after I got mine.  
Ah ok, I was hoping it was the Superman one. Hoping my store still has some. 
Which one is the regular cover? 
I mean, isn’t the point of One Punch Man is that he can beat literally anyone with one punch? Correct me if I’m wrong, I’ve never seen it... 
Good stuff, thank you! 
https://i.imgur.com/24DgEgF.jpg 
Guy who does textless, do your thing!!!! 
I really want a Batman/TMNT cartoon show or animated movie based on the comic series. I loved the first arc.
That's an odd way to spell Blue Beetle and Booster Gold. 
Can’t wait for this year’s...







ಥ_ಥ 
Dope! And the fact that it includes Superman makes it so much cooler! 
Real talk though, *Everybody Knows* is a sick track. Been listening to it over and over.
Bane and Nightwing are probably tied for me.
Just reading yours and u/poopsmith666 's comment and having a good laugh because they're too real. 


I miss baseball...  
I can't wait for Buck Martinez to attempt this name 
Man of Steel 2 would be cool with me tbh.
I audibly gasped when I saw that page
Yeah, he can bulk up, no doubt about that. But even with camera tricks, making him look and have the same presence as Ben’s Batman could prove tricky. 
Since Affleck proved me wrong, I’m trying to be more open to casting choices. However, I just can’t see this. Gyllenhaal is mighty talented, but the two are just completely different. Size, voice, age, they look almost nothing alike. Even though Jake is almost 40 he could still very well pass as much younger man. I just can’t see how this will work and feel like a natural change. His presence on screen will be entirely different in my opinion. Batman is too front and centre for big changes like this to happen without explanation. 

I can see him pulling off Dick Grayson, but I’m not loving the idea of him as Bruce Wayne. 

I’m prepared for downvotes, I just had to share this. 
I really want to see what the first message was in this picture 
Ahh, thank you. 7 and half more hours.
Can I watch this video without anything being spoiled?
Never saw Man of Steel in theatres. One of my biggest regrets. So when I saw it for the first time I immediately questioned my decision to not see it in theatres. 

BvS, “this was amazing! It gave me Batman and Superman on the big screen together for the first time! A childhood dream.” Felt the fight between the two could’ve been longer though. 

Suicide Squad, I felt pretty weird afterwards. Like I still think it was an odd choice for a movie especially so early on in the DCEU. I only really liked Deadshot and the Batman parts tbh. 

Wonder Woman, same as you pretty much. The corny bits at the beginning were kind of off putting for me. But it really was a movie that made me feel good at the end. 
Just you, man... 
Oh I’m aware of Jessica Chastain. Made herself look foolish on twitter today. 
Unfortunately the interview can't be viewed in my country, but it's true. This is a complete non-issue.
Holy hell. Do these people think that Amazons (fictional) would spend 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in full armour? 

In Wonder Woman they had very similar armourless looks. 
45 apps, 215 photos

https://i.imgur.com/Kmn91qy.jpg 
As a voice, sure. 

Live-action, maybe... But imagine NPH Riddler going up against Batfleck? One punch, he's done. 
This flip flopping is annoying. I want Ben to stay Batman. 

But if they have to change him, I'd prefer them to go younger and find someone willing to commit to the role for several years. Have Barry mess up the timeline and have a younger Batman come in. However, I think they would need to do this before they can cast Nightwing, Batgirl, and any other Bat-Family members. Because if he gets younger, then they have to get younger as well. 
That's still amazing 
I thought at first you were the guy who played Zemo (Daniel Brühl) in Captain America: Civil War. 
Them being out of order is really bothering me 
Batman has been my favourite so far. But does Mr. Miracle count because I love that book too! 
I’ll do that, thank you 
Awesome! Thanks so much. 
The machine is inside the theatre? 
My scene points card from Cineplex and then my debit and visa. That’s it. 
Delete this. Try your title again.
I have tried numerous times. The link won't work for me. I just get a white page. Maybe because I'm on Safari?

I'll try Chrome. 

Edit: Even on Chrome it didn't work. 
Yes, definitely. Slightly unrelated as it applies to movies rather than TV, but I was reading that Henry Cavil (Superman in the DCEU) acknowledges that the first two movies of the franchise had their problems (I personally enjoy all the movies quite a bit aside from Suicide Squad) and that after Wonder Woman’s critical success, the movies will have to be better. 

So yeah, actors are aware I would say. It’s just a matter of how public they want to be with their awareness. 
MaJiKartwork seems to be the source. 
Could you maybe take a close-up of the signature?
I usually go the full 2 years of my contract if possible. I think the only time I didn't was when I upgraded from the 4s to the 5s. I think I made it about a year and then upgraded. 
A bug 
Yeah sometimes. So that's why I try to switch it up from time to time. But like I said, something always feels off so I end up switching it back. 

It's a picture of the Toronto city skyline which is a city I love, so I never really get tired of seeing it. I try to switch up the image of the skyline but none of them ever seem as nice as the one I use most often. 
1. Bane
2. Joker 
3. Scarecrow
4. Penguin 
5. Man-Bat
6. Solomon Grundy
7. Deadshot
8. Black Mask
9. Mr. Freeze
10. Clayface
Almost never honestly. I try new wallpapers but then something just feels off, so I end up switching back. I’ve been using the same wallpaper for probably 3 years. 
Ya I mean if anything, it potentially set up Thor’s story arc for infinity War. 
Could be, yeah. 
For people who understand the MCU it did. For the casual audience, maybe not so much. Several people in the theatre around me could be heard asking “what is that?” Even my buddy next to me who has come to see every MCU movie on opening night who is well versed in the universe asked me what he was looking at in the first after credits scene. 
Top for sure. Oddly enough, Batman is the only one that looks somewhat natural on the bottom. 
I mean, I can't really see anything...
Gotta be more specific... Jason or Patrick? 
While that's almost certainly what it is, at first glance it looks way too small to be his Batsuit. 

I initially thought, maybe that's Nightwing's suit but that wouldn't make much sense. But the more I look at it, I see blue on the arm and the chest. I'm probably just projecting... 

Edit: Aww shucks... just saw the clip that this picture is from 
Not enough T-Rex or giant penny. 
I've had the 4s, 5s, 6 and now 7 Plus. 

I'd have to say the 5s was my favourite, in terms of design, but the 7 Plus is the best overall that I've had. 
I look at Batman and Bruce Wayne separately. 

Batman (from best to worst): 
- Kevin Conroy 
- Ben Affleck 
- Michael Keaton
- Val Kilmer 
- Adam West 
- Christian Bale 
- George Clooney 

Bruce Wayne 
- Kevin Conroy 
- George Clooney
- Ben Affleck 
- Adam West 
- Christian Bale
- Michael Keaton 
- Val Kilmer 
I think all the cases are really nice at first. But the light colours tend to not age as well. The saddle brown and black ones age really nicely. 
Wonder Woman 
Oh cool... like Trinity... minus Superman...
Off 
That’s sweet
He’d be a cool character to appear in Nightwing or Titans I think. 

Also, wasn’t there a theory that after Dick Grayson dropped the Red X name, that it was Jason Todd who took over? Or am I not remembering it correctly?
Detective comics would be the closest 
Kind of looks like he blocks it with his cape 
The Mr. Freeze is fantastic haha
It’s in their best interest to fail drivers. Keep at it, you’ll get it. 

I don’t have experience personally, but all my friends have gone to Brantford for their driving tests and all have had great experiences.

They keep putting this blue tint/light on him though and I’m not sure how I feel about it. 
The JL suit would be perfect in my opinion if it were the colour of th BvS suit. 
 Buddy who does textless versions, do your magic!!! 
I haven't watched the show, so I'm not familiar with the actors in it. However, just from seeing pictures on the internet I assumed it was all kids, so I was a bit concerned that it was one of the kids who was caught with cocaine. 
Has literally nothing to do with iPhone or Apple.

Oh that is better. I actually like that quite a bit, but you were right. It will probably end up looking black over time. 
I agree. Is it supposed to be like a navy blue? 
Looks black in the picture, but I'm going to say Saddle Brown. Just from past posts, it looks like it ages well.

Let me see number 1 first. 

But Zack Snyder hasn’t let me down whatsoever yet.

I like your drawing more than that film.

Batman: Gotham Knight  
He's green and furry... Does it matter? 
Why would this mean that Gotham is ending? They're completely separate universes on two totally different TV networks... Also DC/WB will capitalize off Batman as much as possible. 

I'm not saying you're wrong, but you seem 100% sure.
No that's fair. I wasn't baiting the guy who I asked the question to, I was genuinely curious. And physical attraction is preference based. You may not find her attractive, but I'm certain others do. 
Buddy’s in the east end on Barton is great. 
Why’s that? If you don’t mind me asking 
Probably the best casting yet! And I think they’ve all been great choices. 
Catman would be up there. I think Solomon Grundy is very underused. 
I can’t wait for the inevitable gif of Gal at the 25 second mark. 
*And the humor tag was taken advantage of on this day...* 

- Martian Manhunter - leader 
- Nightwing ideally, but he’d be reluctant. So Midnighter, but he’d have to alter his methods. 
- Wally west flash
- Kyle Rayner Green Lantern 
- Mera 
- Donna Troy 
- Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) 
Justice League vs. Suicide Squad would be neat. Since we know DC/WB likes to milk Batman and Harley Quinn, I can see this one being a real possibility. 
I don’t hate Cyborg. In fact, I really like Cyborg. He was my favourite Titan. But, as others have said, he was a better Titan than he is a JL member/founder. 
The war of Jokes and Riddles. Not so much because I overly enjoyed it, but I think it would make it easier to understand. 

I kept forgetting what happened in the previous issue. 

And not a Rebirth arc, but Batman/TMNT animated film pls. 
Not going to lie, I laughed when I saw Sandman (Marvel). 
Idk but that’s a great wallpaper 
I’m guessing you like Harley 
Next time I’m in that Walmart I’ll look again and take a pic if i see it. 
I saw a hoodie at Walmart here in Canada yesterday too. It was black and then had all the character’s logos lined up in a horizontal line in grey and said Justice League above them. 
TIL Stan Lee believes us all to be illiterate. 
She just asks dumb questions. 

Going back to when EE came back he was watching his wildcard game home run and understandably he got teary eyed and her first question was “are you getting emotional?” 

Like obviously, Hazel... 
> I have alcoholics in my family who refused to pay that much for beer at the Skydome. 

I laughed. 
She’s ok when she’s not interviewing players individually. I cringed throughout her whole interview when Encarnacion came back to Toronto. 
Battery is my only issue now too. 
I’m sure seeing as it’s a franchise they’re all more or less the same. The queenston location is just the only one I’ve ever been to. 
Red Rockets on Queenston, 2 for 1 pizza and wings on Kenilworth, and oddly enough the Splitsville bowling alley has really good wings. 
At least 30 seconds.

30 Seconds...to mars 

Jared Leto plays in the band 30 seconds to mars...

Jared Leto is the joker in the DCEU...

Is this a fact or are you speculating? 
Well, I’m tempted to agree. However, if they have a version with Superman ^and ^Hal, then I think it should be the official poster. 
Wtf...
Yeah my bad 
Nah, no matter what she looks like, cheating on someone makes you trash. 

Not saying he did, but in general.

Who was she again? 
https://i.imgur.com/yUpccOs.jpg 
Yes 
Sinestro was great. Mark Strong was amazing in the role. Probably the only reason I can go back and watch that movie. 
I assume we in Canada share the same release as the US. The animated Wonder Woman drawing was especially bad imo. 
I miss HMV... when it left Canada I was heartbroken. It was literally the one store I had to go in whenever I went into a mall. 
Jealous of the U.K. steelbook for Wonder Woman and suicide squad. 
He probably won’t be out to promote the film before release, but I would almost guarantee he’d be there once the film has been released. Think Colin Firth with the Kingsman sequel, *if you’ve seen it*...
Probably any dollar store or any one of those stands in shopping malls. 
That cowl looks so cool without the goggles 

😩😩👌👌
https://i.imgur.com/A26Hira.jpg 
Aquaman says something (paraphrasing, I’ll have to watch it again) like “the man is stronger alone” or something like that. Because Aquaman is obviously strong and wants to be alone. 

Then Bruce says that that’s the opposite of the saying. The saying is that people are stronger together rather than alone. 

Also, when he says it’s something darker, maybe he realizes it’s not just an invasion, where Steppenwolf will come and go, but he is literally going to try and destroy everything.  
Yes. 
I think the ban includes vaping. 
Is this the first time we’ve seen Batman in the tactical suit without the goggles down? Because it looks sweet. 
I’ve always wondered why Aquaman is holding his trident upside down in this shot
*whispers* always blue... 
I liked all these posters, but that symbol on Batman's chest really bothers me. 
I love it! Thank you so much
Whoever the guy is that does textless versions is, please do your magic. That Batman one would make a sick wallpaper 
You can see the added armour on his shoulder/arm. It’s not the BvS suit. 
The really don’t - A Canadian. 
Man, I can't wait for Justice League 2. All of these promo shots and magazine covers are too sweet, but always missing something... muh Superman...and Hal... And while I get why they're doing, for the casual audience, I really want to see him with the others. 

It's going to be great when they all get to be together!
Yeah it’s a little strange. I would’ve preferred Martian Manhunter, or at least Green Lantern. But I still thought it had a cool look. 
we’ve seen Superman in the black suit before in man of steel. Sure it wasn’t in the context of him coming back from death, but it would be nothing new. I’m not sure what the big deal is with seeing him in it again. It’s nothing that special.

I believe the information is on the machine that gives you your ticket. But I think it’s an 8 dollar flat fee over the weekend.

Well I mean as a sidekick, I like Tim Drake Robin the best. 

But you've mentioned Dick Grayson who didn't become Nightwing until he left as Batman's sidekick. Ultimately Nightwing is my favourite second alter ego that one of the Robin's has taken, but as a sidekick, Tim Drake Robin. 

Edit: I guess in a sense Nightwing is still a sidekick in certain situations, as much as he'd hate to admit it. 
Maybe. I’m not entirely sure 
Creepy 
I don't think so either man, I was just kidding. I actually don't care all that much to see the black suit. We already saw what the black suit would look like in Man of Steel. I think it would be weird if he came back with it in all honesty. Like how would they have gotten their hands on a black one to bury him in it? I imagine he'd have to come back in his damaged red and blue suit, because it's not really a costume that he'd have multiple of. It's one of a kind as far as we know. This is why I've never really understood there being no explanation for the changes between the MoS suit and BvS.
I personally believe the space grey 5S is the nicest iPhone to date.

Yeah it was, in *Hush*. I don’t think his hair was red though. 
Interesting take on Jason 
Quite possibly. But I’d need more information. 

1) what’s the site? 
2) is it paid? 
3) when you say expand, what exactly do you have in mind?

It’s one of my favourite movies of all time
Good news, a second season was recently confirmed
I noticed his absence too. Then I realized they’re standing in front of the Arkham games Batman logo and a screen cap of Gotham from the Arkham games. Kevin Conroy voiced Batman in those games. 

Kevin Conroy IS Gotham. 
I'm not going to lie, I haven't thoroughly liked an iOS since iOS 6. But I get used to them. 
Nice! I just broke my yellow and black logo Batman one. Will definitely be keeping my eye out for the JL Batman one. 
Anyone else seem to be experiencing poor cellular service since updating to iOS 11? I feel like every time I look at my status bar my signal is really weak. Like 1 bar out of 4. (Canada, Fido btw)

I feel like making Ottawa Street a 40km/h zone would make more sense. 
All of that red is off-putting. 
I get what you’re saying. To me, every time I open an app with one of those big bold headings all I can think is “this looks like a Pages document...”
Maybe he’s getting a pep talk from Bats or Wonder Woman about how he can help them beat the parademons/steppenwolf. 
Ah ok, my bad for not reading I guess. Any idea if there’s plans to expand? 
They gave me 10% back. They said I could've taken it in for exchange but I don't live that close to a Best Buy and I'm sure the steel books sold out fast in stores.

Every single bus stop... Honestly, it's the only place on campus where I'm bothered by people smoking. 
Seems Titans Season 1 is filming in Toronto too!
Hamilton. So kind of far but at the same time not THAT far. 
I'm so close to Toronto! This is exciting
Damn man... they know how to get me.

Not sure about comics, but I really want that Batman/TMNT crossover to be made into an animated film.

Everything about this list hurts me... 


If I had to pick a single worst then I'd pick Meredith. Andy season 9 is also bad, but before that he was great. 
Looks like something hot topic would get 
That's true. So maybe Rogers, Telus, Bell will get it right away. Fido, Virgin, Koodo later on. 
That's interesting. Did they give you a reason why? I'm with fido too, and was contemplating it. 
This should be the answer for every one of the questions on this sub. People are asking questions that no one could possibly have the answers to yet. 
Yaeah I don't like that, man...
I just got around to watching this show and it was surprisingly good. I was just talking to a friend today about how I was really hoping for a second season. This is great news. 
I don't know who I'd get to replace him, but I really don't like Tim Sale's art so if he could be replaced for the Long Halloween, I could probably really enjoy that story. The art took me right out of it. 

Same with Frank Miller. I don't like his art all that much. I'd like to see an artist like Jason Fabok re-do all the art but keep the story exactly the same. 

My default answer would be Jason Fabok for everything I think. 
Oh for the 8 and x, no there is not matte or her black option it seems. They've gone back to space grey.

I really liked Nate in the later years of the Office. While I like the seasons after Michael left, there was definitely a decline. Nate was a positive though. 

Also Russ in Silicon Valley. 
Amy Adams 
Amber Heard

My top 3. 
That's fair. I'm honestly open to pretty much anyone as I have no real emotional ties to the character. Although, I seem to be in the minority group of people who are very against John Cena. I would not like that. 

However, since seeing the movie Patriot's Day, I think Jake Picking would be a great choice. In the film he portrays campus police officer Sean Collier (I believe that is his name) so at times he's serious but he's also seen as laid back and is shown fooling around and playing video games. So I think he could play the grown up-child role pretty well. Plus he looks the part I think. 
Can he act? 
If it's causing multiple people harm, including other kids, then I don't see why calling the police is excessive. 
Video would be cool
That's amazing. 

Good Guy Apple. 
Never fun when you're hometown and one of you favourite teams is involved in controversy.

Why?
If you were asked a question you'd be forced to speak. You can't just stay quiet. 

In the WW movie at least, it's seen that Steve Trevor tried to withhold information from the Amazons but the lasso started heating up and burning him. I'm not sure if that's comic accurate though. 
I think Tommy Lee Jones could have been really good had it been taken more seriously. 
He wouldn't be my first choice, but I don't hate it. 
No to all of this. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever. 
What are the options, lmao???
Ahh Santos. What a tragedy. Always wished for good things for him. 
That's the current one in Super Sons? If so, I haven't read enough with him in it to judge him. I just read a few issues of Trinity where he appeared. 

He seemed alright. 
Superboy I suppose

Barbara Gordon. However, I do prefer her as Oracle. 
My ultimate goal is to see all the stadiums in person. At the top is PNC Park, but Wrigley and Fenway are definitely up there too. 
I hope to make it to Wrigley one day. It's on the bucket list for sure. 
I'm pretty sure that book takes place earlier in Batman's career. Hence the reason he's not wearing his Rebirth costume, Catwoman appeared in her "Classic" purple outfit. 

Plus the panels the flash to Bruce and Selena in bed. 
Been buying since I was 8, started seriously when I was 15. I'm now 21

I was really digging Titans when it first started. Now I'm considering dropping it. I'm hoping to next arc can keep me invested. 
It would probably go on for a long while, but the JL has Superman, so... 🤷🏻‍♂️

I think ultimately it would come down to Superman and Hulk.

"Greg Zaun is a work"

I just don't get the man. He dresses like a pack of florescent highlighters but says these players have to relax and calm down. He says they should go back to the old ways, but seems to forget that baseball, as with most professional sports, is just a child's game. Let them have fun. 
Great game ruined by the stick that seems to be up Zaun's ass. 
I like ensemble books a lot. However, I prefer Batman on his own with occasional cameos from Nightwing, Robin, and some league members. 

I like some of the Bat-family members, but when detective comics came out in Rebirth I really didn't like he Bat-family all that much. I mean, Clayface??? Tim Drake got shafted once again in that book. 
What am I missing?

Jake Picking. He's a relatively unknown, but I think he looks the part and has the acting ability to play a young person in a adult body. His most noticeable role is that of Officer Sean Collier in Patriots Day. In the movie he portrays a campus police officer so at times he's serious, but other times in the film he is seen kicking back playing video games and hanging out with friends. 

Pretty random, I know. But I always like to see the unknowns get a shot. 
1. Arkham Origins 
2. The regular more modern suit that appears in Hush 
3. Batman v Superman regular suit 
What? 
I don't know how much it's changed, but in first and second year one of my friends was with wind and he often had trouble getting service around campus. Granted, in some buildings I lost service as well with Fido, but even outdoors out in the arts quad he even lost service just sitting outside. One of my co-workers is with wind, or freedom as they're calling it now I think, and he constantly loses service. This is in Hamilton's east end though. 

I know they're getting better though. Just not sure how much better its gotten. As for cheap plans under $50, I'm not sure. But if you find something decent that offers a decent amount of data for around $50, I'd love to know lol. 

Good luck! 
I love these batarangs so much. I feel like they can actually do some damage. I liked Bale's Batman tech to a certain extent, but the batarangs specifically were not great looking. They looked very light and small. More practical yes because he could probably carry more of them at a time, but Batfleck's look like multipurpose tools. 
I actually howled when I read that part.
Yikes... That's too similar fam

Oh really? I don't read Flash but that's an odd creative choice they made. 
I can definitely see him saying it during the football footage. Maybe once (more than once would be pushing it) during a fight with some parademons. But I don't want it to be like a thing he does all the time. 

Edit: I can also see Barry hearing him say it and then loving it. So he says it a few times. 
He's an alright character, not so much in the animated films though. At least in my opinion. 
Batman and Justice League (I'm in teh minority on the latter) 

But justice league has been really entertaining to me up until last week really. Because wtf was last weeks issue?! I didn't enjoy that one very much but overall I like it.

I don't know actually. It's been awhile since I've seen that movie. I actually really don't like that movie at all. Do they ever say Bruce Wayne is dead in the movie? 

I would assume they'd just say he's retired and moved to Florence. Because someone as noticeable as Bruce Wayne just chilling in a café in Florence would be hard to miss. 
Nothing is confirmed. People have their theories about whether he lived or died. I personally feel like he lived. 


Are you asking about the Dark Knight Rises or the Dark Knight Returns?

Thanks for your help! 
I'll keep that in mind. However, my parents and myself all got our phones this week and they all have the same issue. I'm leaning more towards a bug in the update. I'll set up an appointment to have it checked out anyway. 
I personally really like the Upper James one. It's usually pretty busy but I always find everything I'm looking for including new stuff there. Second would be the centennial parkway one. I would also throw Ancaster in there as well. 

I try to avoid going to them Barton street one all together. Terrible parking, the store feels tight when you're walking through. Especially down the main aisle where they have all their displays. 
That scene where Batman glides in is the one of my favourite moments from the DCEU so far. A close second behind Rick Flagg destroying a chicken leg in his hotel room. 

But it's just so Arkham Origins-esque. I love it so much!
Any just by the looks of it, way younger. I could be wrong though.

He also tagged the Toronto Sun in his instagram post earlier today but has since me untagged them. Maybe he realized it was a bit much. Or was advised to untag them.

Do we know if he can turn his head in that cowl? Maybe it's not that he isn't looking, but he CAN'T look. 

Still looks badass though. 
Then get an actor who is actually in a wheelchair??? I'm certain there's a number of them out there.

Also, have there been a lot of complaints about Charlie Cox playing a blind lawyer/vigilante in Daredevil? Because I haven't seen a lot.

Not sure about the exact time because I'm not watching the film at the moment, but it looks to be the scene near the end where the joker is on top of the building with Batman when he asks "wanna know how I got these scars"

And Batman replies "no, but I know how you got these"

Sorry, hope I'm getting back to you in time, but you should go to the right lane always. Until they tell you to switch lanes to turn, you should always remain in the right lane. 
During my test, I had to turn left onto Nash from Barton, so I did my turn and they once it was safe to do so, switched to the right lane and remained there until the tester told me to switch again to make another left turn. 
The parallel parking was definitely in the parking lot that they have set up. I can't say for sure about the other things. If I recall, my brother had to do his 3 point turn on a side street that they took him down. 
If you get the same tester that I got, they're going to sit like an animal in your passenger seat. I was shook. She had her foot tucked under her. And when I asked if she was cool with me turning the AC on she seemed pissed... Other than that, it was pretty simple. Just remember everything you practiced. I also didn't have to do any emergency stops, 3 point turns, or up-hill/down-hill parking. I know some people have to, so just be prepared in case. 

Good luck!

No, sorry. I had a lot of ideas I was trying to type out because I was on break at work and there was a lot of noise in the break room. I meant to say, like in Arkham Knight I think it would be cool to see Nightwing taking out Penguins shipments and gang. Then I also meant to say that it would be cool to have Black Mask and Penguin have a turf war in the movie and then have Nightwing take out both their gangs. 
I'd actually prefer Deathstroke be the villain in the Nightwing movie as opposed to Batman. 

That being said, I've always like the idea of Black Mask and Penguin being villains for Nightwing too. Like in the Arkham Knight game, I think it would be cool to see a turf war going on between Penguin and and Black Mask and then Nightwing has to stop them. I dunno, it would probably be too simple a story

Maybe you could make your own ads on Kijiji saying that you wish to do some unpaid roles. I'm sure students in the Theatre program at McMaster could use some actors or extras some times. I'm not sure if non-students are allowed to be in student films, but it's worth a shot.

Thought so. Play Arts Kai I believe.

I really like Justice League: Doom quite a bit 
If I was Bruce I wouldn't want to spend time with that little a-hole either tbh. 
Before the Flash got really popular after his TV show, I would've said Green Lantern (Hal Jordan). But now I would agree it's definitely the Flash. 

Don't get me wrong, the Flash was always popular but not so mainstream like he is now. 
I don't care what people say about this film and Batman and Robin. They were my childhood along with the animated series. 
If I remember correctly, no they don't. They just see trouble and know they need to get to work. They don't need someone to yell "action" or something like "titans go" or "avengers assemble" to remind them that there's trouble afoot. 
I thought it was enjoyable. The voice acting kind of took me out of it though. 
I dunno, but Paranormal State used to be a good show 
The moment he proposed I already started picturing her death. I feel like now it's inevitable. Maybe in the next arc
That's just inverted colours 
True, good points. I liked his design overall. I wasn't necessarily blown away by it, but it was still cool. 
That's also a possibility. Although I just recall him looking like an actual man. You could see his flesh coloured legs and arms and such. This figure makes him look more "demonish" I guess. 

Idk, I'm not really bothered by the design they went with in the movie either way. I think it served it's purpose.
Possibly. Although the armour on this figure looks like actual armour. In the movie it really just looked like metal thrown together. Also the sword looks like a proper sword (other than being Red of course) 
The costume is also hundreds of years old by the time BvS rolls around. 

Maybe thousands 👀
Wow! What a new and original theory!!!
Didn't even know the Black Eyed Peas were still together.

3. Wonder Woman - BvS 
4. Superman - Man of Steel 
5. Faora - Man of Steel 
6. Batman's nightmare suit - BvS
7. Batman's JL suit (the non-armoured one) 
8. Deadshot - Suicide Squad 
9. Silk Spectre II - Watchmen 
10. Wonder Woman with the cape/cloak - Wonder Woman

Hello! First off, Congrats on getting accepted. 

I'm going into my fourth year of communications at McMaster. The program has been great so far. All of the professors I've had at Mac in the program have been awesome. The program isn't difficult. At least I don't think so. Of course, it's different for everyone. Some of the more theory and research methods courses can be a bit more challenging, but they all have their redeeming qualities, such as fun group projects, great profs, etc... being in this program also means we get to take some multimedia classes, which in my experience, have all been pretty fun and interesting. In fact, they've been some of my favourite classes. I don't think there is any real distinct advantage of taking communications at Mac, I think it's a pretty general program. But I will say, I think we have some of the top profs in the field. 

Whatever you decide on, good luck. 
Out of the teams you put together, I'd pick team 1. In my opinion, the teen titans should always be led by a Robin. Also, Blue Beetle is one of my favourites. 
It's perfect! Thank you so much!
He can "confirm" anything he wants. At the end of the day though, it's not up to him or his call. 
I thought I lost this post. Anyway, I love this wallpaper so much so thank you for sharing. 

I was wondering though, is there any chance you have, or could make, a version of this wallpaper where it's just batman like you have him and then the background is black? 

I think that would be a sick wallpaper. Thanks again! 
Oh ok. Still no. I don't think he's underrated either. He's one of the big icons of comic book and pop culture history. His symbol is one of the most recognized in the world. 
I'm a bit confused by your wording but I think I understand your question. Yes some think he's overrated (I think that's the word you meant) but I don't think he is. 

Anyway, I don't hate superman personally. I don't necessarily find him boring but not all that exciting either. I prefer superman when he's with the league though. I don't really read or have ever read any of his solo books to be fair though. 
Dead 
Here's an upvote tho 
I'm not too sure if it was ever in a book. I just saw it on the internet one day. Then I saw the name in the corner and looked up more of his art and he instantly became one of, if not my favourite artist. This was the first piece of his that I saw. 

Then I found out he's a fellow Canadian and liked him even more!

Batman for me also. One criticism I have with him isn't necessarily something about the character, but more so how he's used. I don't like how he is used in so many different stories. In Rebirth alone, he's in Batman, Detective comics, All-Star Batman, Justice League, Justice League of America, I may have missed a few. 

I understand he makes DC a lot of money, but DC has so many great characters. I love Batman, but he's way too overused. It's hard to try and keep up with a character when they are used as much as he is. Even in the animated films. Sure, it wouldn't have been a bad idea for him to be in the Justice League Dark film, but he didn't have to be in the whole film. Also, other characters besides Batman have great stories that can be turned into animated films.

I love that shot of her climbing the ladder out of the trench 
I think the Batman Inc costume is the only time I have like the yellow oval 
I'm in Hamilton. I don't vape, but I'd like to see this store just for laughs. 

Where is it located? 
6, always. 
I really hope it comes back. It's definitely one of my favourite podcasts. 
Well the first complaint isnt really fair I suppose, but the captions didn't make a lot of sense a lot of the time. So as a non-Russian speaker who had to rely on the captions, that was a bit annoying. 

The story was odd. Was kind of a weird concept. 

Mostly though, the effects were pretty damn awful. The cgi was terrible. A level of terrible you wouldn't expect to see this day in age. And when they tried to practical, even worse 
Did he take it down already? 
I mean go watch it if you feel so inclined. I would just never recommend it to anyone. 
This movie is online in HD. Watched it a couple of days ago. 


10/10 wouldn't recommend. 
I don't think they've uploaded today. And according to the fella in the very first trash vid, they want to upload everyday. Maybe we've scared them away? 
I've never really seen Jim Lee use a bright blue. I've seen him use darker blues that look more like shading and shadows. And even if the costume does have blue, it's still a darker blue like navy blue. 

But yes I agree about the light blue in general. It was a great look for the time. But light blue would not look good today when stories are darker, more grounded and realistic. 

As for the yellow oval logo, I don't hate it. It's not my favourite, but I don't hate it. Again, it was cool for a time, but not very realistic for today. 
I would say Tinder is definitely the big one. Probably followed by Bumble. 
You're right, my mistake. Still, just for anyone who reads this, don't be mean. 
Nope nope nope. There's no reason to be mad at them or send them hate. Can you be annoyed? Yes. But there's no reason to send them hate. They're just doing their jobs. From what I gather, NowThis is based in New York. Not a cheap place. People have to collect pay cheques. 
I'll tell you right now, Shelby's twitter handle is pretty accurate to what I was thinking when reading her replies. 
Lmao, I literally just commented this on the video. Great minds 
I also have both, and to be honest I don't particularly care for either of them. However, I always put the comic version of a character front and centre. So I'd have to pick the Greg Capullo one. Even though I don't care much for the face. 
Fair enough
Nah fam, wtf is this shite? 
I like the look of the Batman Begins suit better than the TDK and TDKR suits tbh. Especially the bat logo on the chest of the Begins suit. Never was a huge fan of the TDK logo. Too small in my opinion. 

However, I was also never a fan of the suits being all black.
You could probably get Todd to sign it since he created the character. I myself got Stan Lee to sign a Spider-Man book even though he didn't actually work on the book. But he created the character. 

As for the artist, naah. If he didn't draw it, I wouldn't get him to sign it. 
From my understanding, I don't think the camera goes off unless you enter the intersection when the light is already red. If you entered on a yellow, you should be good. 
What do you mean by stuck? Like you haven't been offered an upgrade? You don't want to upgrade?

Oh man, the BvS announcement is definitely up there followed by seeing BvS for the first time. I had never been so excited for anything in my life. I was not disappointed. 


Love this series. Can't wait to see more. 

Also, everyday I keep checking for ismavlogs and Off the Rails. Can't wait for those either! 
I know it's not what you asked for, but it's close. And these are very nice too I think; 

https://bonney.io/wallpaper
Haha, I get the sense that this is actually true. 
No advice unfortunately, but good luck with your business! 
Odd post 
I don't understand the question. 
Contact the city of Hamilton directly. They should be able to confirm its validity. 
I love when guys give that answer. Any sport, it never gets old. 
Oh for sure, don't get me wrong. I love that suit, but I just don't think it would work in the movie lol. Although, it looks like Robin wore shorts so who knows 🤷🏻‍♂️
1. Doomsday. He beat Superman who beat the Hulk. 
2. Captain America sadly. Strength, agility, stamina. Maybe a younger Batman though.
3. Probably a close one, but Black Window
4. Wonder Woman. I think this would also be close even though I've never really thought of this fight happening. 
5. Superman, not as close as the other fights, but still could be close. 

edit: Oops, I was basing my fights off of comic versions (in a movie sub, silly me). Mostly with Doomsday and Hulk. Since we don't know either of their limits in the movies it would be hard to say. I'm just going to stick with Doomsday though just because we've seen him adapt a bit more to damage. Growing spikes, heat blasts, etc. 
I appreciate that his answer points more towards blue. Nightwing should never be in red. I just hope we don't get this costume that he tweeted... 
Looks like Hot Toys figures. 
Big if true 
Ahh, I don't have Kohl's where I am in Canada. Thanks though! 
Need. Where did you acquire such a great shirt?
Rowdy is the name of one of our best minor league players.
Man, Batman #21 today was real solid. However, JL vs SS #1 was also pretty good. 

Also any of the I am Bane arc was very enjoyable for me from Batman. 
I'll never be able to un-see it now. 
Cool idea I suppose. I've always wanted an Ismahawk silicon wrist band. Maybe one day. 
I don't know about all comic book shops, but the guys at my local one said that they had ordered a lot of extras in anticipation of this book being a big seller. So I would check your local comic book shop either later on wednesday or early thursday if possible. 
No she wouldn't have to use them, but she's an amazon warrior. It's what they use. 
We got the Bo-Sox starting tomorrow. Should be a good series. 
Needs more Blue Jays. - A (sad) Blue Jays fan aka. me. 
Sounds like a mix of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. 
Could be just due to water or sweat getting caught between the band and your skin for long periods of time. I know that happens sometimes when I wear silicon wristbands. 

Nonetheless good on your Apple Store for looking after you with ease like that. Always nice to hear positive customer service stories. 
4 of them. Batman, Titans, Justice League, Detective Comics. 

Those are listed from best to worst in my opinion. 
Of the ones I'm pulling, Detective Comics. I've already dropped it once, but then it got good for a couple issues. Now I'm not crazy about it again. 
The only shows I watch Religiously right now are Silicon Valley and the Walking Dead. Out of the two of them, the Walking Dead, easily. 

Of shows that I watch usually because another family member is watching it that I hate is the Big Bang Theory. I honestly don't know how this show is staying strong... Actually, I do know why but anyway... I admit, the first couple of seasons were entertaining and even somewhat good. 
I think that concept looks really cool. I'm not a huge fan of the Flash so keeping his costume look very traditional isn't something that weighs on my mind. So in that case I don't think he needs yellow boots. I can't imagine a way for them to do it without him looking like he's wearing rain boots. 

That being said, they pulled off Batman's grey costume which is something I thought could never be done, so maybe it could work, I don't know. 
Gotta be honest, the HUMOR tag was a little misleading.

Damn...
Dang, this is cool
Umm... no 

Maybe as a secret link or something. 
Ugh, can Barney not play 3rd? 

I'd rather have his bat in there
You could start with N52 but once it ends that's when Rebirth starts and that is a different superman 
This is so tight
Those first few Batman concepts look a lot like they're inspired by Jae Lee's new 52 Batman look. 
I need "Make 'Em Laugh" framed and on my wall yesterday! 
I really want to see Tim. He'll probably get handled in a shitty way like he almost always does in the comics though. 

I think introducing Damian would complicate things too much. Too much backstory would need to be told. I don't think general audiences are prepared for all the backstory and explaining this would need. 
Jane Levy would be the only one on this list that I could actually see working. 
Why do you want to re-watch that catastrophe? 
Jeremy Irons is such a G... 
I haven't seen much in terms of products yet. However, I work in a grocery store and today at work I saw Wonder Woman on some Dr. Pepper bottles. 

I was hyped. 
You mean like a Greek inspired warrior look? Perhaps an Amazonian? 
It'd probably be hard to sell after that Halle Berry catastrophe. 


Also it would be unnecessary, in my opinion. 
I'd be totally down for Saoirse Ronan or Jane Levy 
Maybe 25-30 years ago. 
It took awhile for me to warm up to the purple in the cape 
Nightwing should've never been in red. I wasn't a fan of New 52 Poison Ivy either. I'm not gonna lie though, I never really minded Red Robin's suit in New 52. 

When Rebirth came out, I wasn't a fan of Batman's look. However, now I really kind of like it. 
I always thought of Metropolis as Chicago. Interesting! 
Too bad he was in red tho... 
I don't think Fillion looks the part, personally. 
These are cool, man! Any chance you have one for Batman from his most recent solo Justice League poster?

Long Halloween is really good. I've always felt the Killing Joke was really overrated. It's good the first time you read it (if you don't know the story already), but other than that, it's not all that exciting in my opinion. 

I've never read Year One, but I've seen parts of the animated film. It seemed decent. 
That's exactly what I was thinking 
Nope...
1. Jason Fabok 
2. Jim Lee 
3. Mikel Janin or Lee Bermejo, can't decide.

I forget which issue of Batman this is from unfortunately. 
I don't have any real advice. But congratulations and welcome to McMaster! 
The Arkham Origins suit is probably my favourite suit he's ever worn. 

However I'm currently really warming up to his Rebirth suit. 
- John
- Hal
- Kyle 
- Jessica 
- Simon 
- Guy
Well his skin was actually bleached and he just work lipstick, but fair enough I suppose. 

I guess I've always thought of the joker as a suit and tie wearing "classier" villain. Half the time Leto's joker isn't wearing a shirt. 

I think I just need to see more of him to warm up to his look. 
No not clown makeup, but make up in general. His makeup at least attempted to give him the red smile of a clown. And the purple suit as well. 
I am not a fan of Leto's Joker look at all. This is almost entirely because nothing about it resembles a clown, or gives any substance to the whole clown thing. Aside from the jester tattoo I guess, but it's not really seen all that much. 

Ledger had the makeup like a clown would have, Nicholson had the clothes and the different "toys" and silly weapons, Romero a combination of the two. But to me there is nothing "clownish" about Leto's Joker. 

I appreciate this post.
I remember reading this exact article a year or more ago..
All of them??!??

But I guess anything against Texas and Baltimore could have a chance of being spicy as well. 
I'm loving Batman right now. It started slow and Detective Comics was better at the beginning but it has since swapped for me. Now Batman is better than Detective Comics imo. 

I also love Titans and Trinity. 

However, due to money not being there I've had to choose the three books I really wanted to keep reading and those are Batman, Justice League and Titans. 

When rebirth started I was pulling Batman, All-Star Batman, Detective Comics, Justice League, Nightwing, Titans and Trinity. 
That Red Robin costume is sick

I didn't want an Android and my Blackberry was becoming outdated. Blackberries in general were becoming outdated at the time of my first iPhone. 

But probably more than anything, all my friends at the time had iPhones. 
Croissants get me emotional too...
This is honestly the scene I'm most excited for now.. it looks amazing.
When?!
Once again DC has the argument that KGBeast came first. 
Fair enough man. The scene you chose is extremely badass. I've just never been a huge fan of the Flash in general. They're getting me hyped for him though. 
Care to elaborate on "that roach" guy? 
I don't recall ever seeing that. I'd hope I'd remember something like that 
That's unfortunate 
Respectully disagree. I believe Batman standing on the death statue is the greatest moment. 


Have an upvote though! 
They're doing an amazing job with these. Especially when they get me hyped for a character I've never cared for all that much. Love the look of this flash though! 
Looks dope man! 
Not even close 
I've already warmed up to it. I'm ready. 
Whoa..wait, is this official? What's with the white Bat-logo?

I mean it looks dope, especially that cowl, but the symbol threw me off. 
Someone make that shot of him on the statue a wallpaper pls
I'm gonna pass out... BATMAN STANDING ON THAT STATUE!

Would've looked better with black screen.
I saw Star answer this on a few posts that they don't know yet. 
Kevin Conroy. No better Batman around. 
Impossible 
Wow, amazing, cool, sick, tight, dope.
Looks very Leto Joker-y in that picture. Very slimey looking. 
No worries man. The first one I linked is my personal favourite. It's my laptop wallpaper currently. 
But he didn't know Clark Kent was superman and vice versa. 

So why would he search "strong ass kid from smallville many years ago-superman" it wouldn't make sense. 
Clark saving those kids would have been before the internet.

It's more of a preference thing, but I personally feel his art looks childish
Hahaa, honestly I'll stay for Jim Lee. 
John Romita Jr... I'm out. 
Not particularly. It makes sense for him to stay huge. He needs to be able to hold his own. Like I can picture him brawling with Parademons. 

If a batman who was Bale-sized were to try and take on some Parademons it would be less believable. 
The Apple leather cases are great. 
I'm not gonna say that Sourcefed isn't being cancelled and all these hosts are leaving/being let go, but Steven's video doesn't confirm anything. It just heightens speculation. 
The voice was the smallest issue I had with Nolan's Bane. 
Bane! Done right for once.
Idk about everyday stories, but at Christmas time, I'm gonna read Batman: Nöel to my kids. 
1. DC Universe Classics or DC comics unlimited shiny variant of the same figure (hard to tell from lighting) all stars new 52 superman 
2. DC comics unlimited injustice gods among us superman
4. Looks like a Funko BvS Superman plush 
5. DC Universe Classics All stars New 52 superman (almost positive from the matte paint) 
6. Dc Direct Blackest night superman would be my best guess 
7. Megos Superman 
10. DC Direct  kingdom come Superman based on Alex Ross' artwork 

3,8,9,11. Either I don't know or they are Various DC Direct supermen 

 
I would've never thought of Boyega for Jason Todd. However I think he'd be a good choice.
Just looked back at the post I was referring to, Star says they're part of Group 9 Media. Then someone asked if they still had strong ties with Discovery and she replied no. 
I believe it was Star who mentioned in another post recently that they haven't been with Discovery since 2016. 
Alright
Daredevil's still the best 
Which do I choose? I assume you mean which one do I prefer.

I would say bronze personally.
I don't remember complaints about Affleck's voice not being deep enough... I remember jokes about his Boston accent, but really, he doesn't really have the accent. He has to really put it on if he want's to sound straight out of Boston. 

Armie's voice is just really deep. I'm sure you're right though. As an actor he should be able to alter his voice. It could be awkward though, or even difficult/annoying for him to do. 
He has the right look, but honestly when I picture Hal speak, I don't picture Armie's voice. He's got a very very deep voice. I don't know if it would right with Hal's personality.

"If I had a black order..." 

It's just called an order. 
Ruined you? 

Or evolved you? 
Are you speculating? Or is this fact? 
I'm just ok with it. Like others have said, I'm not a fan of just changing the race for the fun of it. I am all for diversity and representation. 

However, one problem I will say I have it that studios claim to be pushing for representation but it seems the only type of racial diversity we get is black. Granted, Logan introduced a Latina character so I hope that's a sign of change to come, but I think if they really want to push this whole diversity thing, then they've got to be better at it. 
Superman is resurrected and made a Green Lantern. Since Clark Kent was announced as dead (and the whole world now knows this) he has nothing better to do than help protect the ol' sector 2814 as a Green Lantern.
