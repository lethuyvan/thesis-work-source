That’s a twist I could be ok with. The challenge winner choosing the bottom 2 would be refreshing compared to lip sync for your legacy. The current All Stars format has gotten boring. I also wanna see these bitches desperately lip sync for their lives to stay in the competition. 
Smh mess lol
No I didn’t 
THATS THE SEASON 7 GIRL I COULDNT REMEMBER 
Did you expect anything else from VH1? I knew as soon as they switched to VH1 the show was gonna go downhill at some point. S10 has been amazing so far so I have high hopes for the future but I don’t want another AS3
I edited that to fix it immediately but I’m guessing you were already on the thread before I noticed 😂
I mean we have Shea, Ongina, Trinity (both of them), Laganja, Acid Betty, Miz Cracker, Blair, The Vixen, Mariah, Jessica Wild, Valentina, Kelly Mantle, Peppermint, Nina, Porkchop, Ivy Winters, any of the AS1 queens, Willam (a pipe dream, I know), Darienne Lake, Adore, Courtney Act, Mrs Kasha Davis, Max, Monique Heart, Mayhem
Season 11 isn’t filming lol. I’m pretty sure those podcasts were recorded when either S10 or AS3 were filming.
Expect All Stars every year. It seems that they’re moving to a yearly schedule. There have already been rumors about AS4 filming this year anyways so it’s not that far fetched. 
If Laila was on All Stars I would live 
I get that this doesn’t seem believable but why would Alexis lie about it?
All of the t we’ve gotten indicates that Asia will only win one more challenge 
Wasn’t she just compiling T that was being sent around? Or was she trying to pass it off as her own T?
Tbh these last two episodes have shown me that Eureka really could win this even if Aquaria has a better track record. Aquaria is so popular they’d never give up the opportunity of casting her on All Stars 
Bitch what?
I fucking love Monique’s laugh omg
Probably my favorite song on Pop 2 tbh
Oooo shit I woulda sat on Cheechs face in high school tbh
Oh my god she really does have a problem. I hope she gets help. 
Tbh not mad about it. Her look was very fashion forward, even though I think Asias look was the best Eurekas was a close second 
The song is called The Realness sis
99%, got it a few weeks after launch. Pretty pleased with the battery life. 
I wonder if we’re gonna get another Ball challenge this season 
I fucking love the skinny meme that stan twitter created😂😂
Challenges like this with 3 teams of 3 are almost always judged as teams
Mmm sis I’ve been getting some bomb ass dick lately so that’s all I can assume you’re talking about 
The edit. The queens had asked Phi Phi for her opinion and she gave them her honest opinion, but the producers edited it to look like she was trying to sabotage them by completely cutting out the queens asking her questions. 
This is why I love Nina so much 
I’m sorry but Blair was deservedly safe last week 
Well the device DOES cost $999 lol I don’t think anyone wants to spend more than that 
It’s just Eureka who wins tonight 
Eureka second week in a row 
Honestly all of them but the top 4
Because AS1 was trash and fucked everyone over. They all deserve another chance. 
S9 clearly didn’t help lol
Fame could definitely make Ru look like Ru. She just has her signature face but she is talented enough to make Ru look amazing 
Yes, since they eliminated Trinity and Shea in front of the crowd they only filmed Peppermint and Sasha 
I would say Madonna for Black Heart tbh
I would be shocked if Eureka didn’t make it to the finale with the edit she’s getting.
I love how someone downvoted you but Willams run in the competition really was iconic. She did very well until her gagworthy disqualification 
5 episodes in and we still don’t have a front runner for the most part. I kinda like it
Ok you got me there 
And your response solves what exactly?
Wasn’t it supposed to be with Aquaria? Technically it already happened 
You’re never gonna become a better person if u don’t try!!
True. I’ve learned to just mind my own business on their social media now 🤷🏼‍♂️ I’ll like the posts I like and then just scroll past the ones I don’t like 
I guess in a sense I did? I do regret it. I didn’t go out of my way to tear her down or try to talk down on her, I mostly just tried to tell her that it didn’t seem right to attack Nina for no reason and completely trash her drag 
I wish I never said anything 😭 even tho it felt right in the moment
I hate that Aquaria blocked me on Twitter cuz I’m on the Aquaria stan train now 😂😂 It wasn’t one of those situations where I attacked a queen tho (I could never), I simply told her that it wasn’t right to trash Nina’s  drag cuz everyone’s drag is different 
Episode 1 would like a word with you
Blair looks so proud in the background I love it
Season 3 would like a word with you. Raven was in the bottom most of AS1 and didn’t win a single challenge. 
I think they’re doing this for a reason. They’re more evenly distributing top placements and challenge wins this season in order to make them matter less.
Because you’re embarrassing the fuck out of yourself lol this has nothing to do with Drag Race
Plenty of T has said Aquaria wins 3 challenges 
Idk, anyone but Blair. I liked her look but it wasn’t top 3 worthy 
I think the first choice is more likely
Robbie Turner award omg skkdmdkd
At this point there’s no chance Vanessa returns tbh. Idk why people enjoy spilling fake t.
I love Cracker but the only challenge I can say she could’ve won was episode 1. But even then Mayhem still deserved her win too. 
If anything this season feels more like the older seasons than anything. The older seasons were definitely more scripted than say seasons 7-9
So you’re saying everyone else is a follower for having a different opinion? You’re literally just being ignorant haha. Drag isn’t ONLY one way. Get with it sis. 
You’re probably the only person that has a problem with her not wearing a breast plate lmao she looked great. Drag doesn’t HAVE to be feminine. And she looks fishy as fuck without the breastplate anyways. Not all women have tits. 
I’m sorry but Blair was deservedly safe this week
Welp looks like our elimination order is accurate 
Mayhem sis not Mayham
Mayhem has been bringing it but so has Vixen lmao
Lmfaoooo I love this gif 😂😂😂
Considering Betty had been in the top almost every week prior, they should’ve put Robbie in the bottom instead 
Alaska 
Vivienne Pinay and her princess wigs
The performance jump alone is worth it to me. You’ll almost never experience any sort of lag or stutter with the 2018 iPad. 
Well ofc, all I’ll find here is bottoms 😂 nothing wrong with that tho I’m a sloppobottomus myself 
Tight and bald for the trade 

Edit: y’all can downvote me all you want I’m still getting good dick 🤷🏼‍♂️
The elimination order is starting to become more clear to us at this point. The first 4 queens were still correct, albeit in the wrong order. 
Vixen is most likely in 7th place. We’re almost 100% sure Mayhem is going this week. 
We’re basically certain Mayhem gets eliminated next but we aren’t sure who sends her home
Would that be the first time someone made top 4 without winning any challenges since Jujubee?
They didn’t lol
Am I the only one happy Eureka is in the top 4? 😂 I liked her on S9 too tho but I can see why people get annoyed by her
Drag Race isn’t on WOWPresents Plus in the US
For me it has been more reliable than Touch ID. I don’t even really notice it there anymore 
Ok but we are not talking about just America. What they are doing within their own community is a problem that must be resolved by them. How nonblack people treat black people needs to be resolved by us. Black people have literally always gotten the shit end of the stick by the rest of the world in basically all of history. 
Nobody will ever have any sort of numbers on this shit, take it from the words of black people around the world. I actually try to listen to what they have to say. I also listen to what the white people around me say when they think nobody’s listening. 
Yes ma’am. Majority of Asians hate black people. Majority of white people in America hate black people. Majority of middle eastern and Eastern European people hate black people. Whether or not people want to admit it, it’s the truth. Just because you are not actively being racist does not mean they aren’t racist. People are just hush hush about their racism. I hear more people being racist than not racist in NEW HAMPSHIRE. This is coming from a white Eastern European. 
Yeah but the majority of nonblack people in the world still hate black people for absolutely no reason
I’m not being serious lmao I’m just an Asia stan
Well considering Dusty wasn’t there after her elimination we can’t expect it to be entirely accurate. Maybe they just couldn’t get any queens that week. 
If Asia gets her second challenge win already just crown her and cancel the rest of the season 

Edit: JK Kimora this wasn’t a serious comment
I swear the editors did this on purpose 😂 how is the only Ru girl in her family not mentioned?
They’re literally just pointing out that everyone told Aja she was a copy of Naomi and now she has more followers. Where’s the drama sis?
Why has this song not been used yet?
Which Drag Race queen is this?
Restart your device and it’ll most likely go back to normal. It’s just a bug. 
Apple sells refurbished devices on their website if you want a cheaper device
Do not buy refurbished devices on Amazon. Ever. They never have warranties. 
IM SCREAMING
Tea, didn’t think about that 
This shows maturity from Eureka tbh. I initially didn’t see all of Untucked and only saw The Vixen blowing up so I didn’t comment on it or make any opinions until I watched the whole thing. Eureka instigated the whole argument but I’m glad they’re cool now. 
It’s a placeholder. Episode 6 of season 1 was the Absolut Ball
I mean Shangela was on season 2 and then 3, so Vanjie being on 10 and 11 would be the same. I think Vanjie needs a little more time before coming back so she can slay
Even though Vixen popped off, Eureka did it on purpose. They both made good points but Eureka shouldn’t had pushed her. 
Her 3rd look to me wasn’t top worthy. Mayhem should’ve been in her spot tbh but almost everyone did well this week
At least she isn’t going down without a fight. She’ll lip sync 3 times but 6th place is still an accomplishment. 
Mayhem goes next I’m pretty sure
I don’t get why literally nobody is seeing how great her looks were? She should’ve been in the top. They were all consistent and well executed. 
I would gag for another Ball omg this really is Season 3 part 2

Edit: it’s a placeholder for sure, episode 6 of season 1 was the Absolut Ball
Stfu don’t try it
Mayhem should’ve been in the top over Kameron in my opinion. Blair should’ve been in the top too. 
I’ll be surprised if Mayhem isn’t in the top this week. She served looks tonight. 
I thought Mayhem had some of the best looks tonight tbh
Sis. Asia’s Martian look was the worst. I’ll be surprised if she isn’t in the bottom 3. 
50 minutes from now
Ah, I figured. Makes sense. 
Did you read the whole comment?
LMFAOOO I WOULD DIE
If Miz Cracker is on AS4 as well I expect a stunt (not saying she can’t earn a crown on her own)
Except Aquaria is the only NYC girl in the top 4 lmao delete this fan fiction sis
Her not auditioning for S11 supposedly came straight from her, but the Dragula audition is a rumor for sure
I think I read on here that Evah didn’t audition this year and auditioned for Dragula S3 instead 
Up until 15 seconds is real. The first 3 seconds is part of Jewels N Drugs. The real instrumental for Ratchet was released by DJWS and you can find it online. She also used it as an interlude during artRAVE
AS3 queens still had some bookings during filming and simply didn’t show up
I thought Manila said she wanted to go back?
*because they need someone to go home first*
I got AppleCare+ for that exact reason. That, and it costs $279 to get the display replaced, which still comes out cheaper to get AppleCare. 
This is actually really good 
I’m pretty sure the only info we have says that S11 will be filmed first but AS4 will air first
NO MA’AM YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING THAT WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING
Nobody does 
I’m so fucking happy I love Vanessa so much 
Idk what you’re talking about but they are exactly the same lmao I’m on 11.3 and that animation is no different than the one I’m seeing on my phone 
That’s exactly what I was getting from it too
It was supposedly an insider but it’s been a while since I’ve seen it mentioned 
I swear she keeps pieces of her dress in her pocket for whenever it gets brought up 😂😂
Maybe the rumors about Mayhem going home are true
I read it on here years ago
Thorgy said that she added the Thor because she tried to make a Facebook page and it wouldn’t let her just use Thorgy. 
Rumor has it that Ru was pushing for Ginger to win and production chose Violet
That’s basically what it does. It lowers the brightness when the display has a lot of white content displayed. 
Shea and Kim Chi were definitely asked and declined. Kim said she let everyone think she said yes so they were all gagged when she didn’t show up 
But wasn’t there rumors that S11 starts filming before S10 is done airing? In order to keep the Nancy Drew’s distracted 
Literally nobody knows exactly how any of the T-spillers got their shit
Idk, if you see close up pics of her at a certain angle her nose still looks big. I think she just contours her nose. 
I am. The mobile app has been having problems lately 
Doesn’t show for me either
I couldn’t help but crack up when Eureka said that lmao
I’m not sure if I buy the 3rd persons T, cuz if Eureka only lip syncs once then who is in the double shantay episode 9?
Yes and someone shared the link here once so I’m now scarred for life
LMFAOOOO
Aquaria supposedly doesn’t win any challenges until Snatch Game but I don’t think that came from a reliable source
Omg what if they do a music video for Call Me Mother?
I think the T we have about what happens in the second half of the competition is more accurate tbh
I mean Monet showed us she isn’t that great when it comes to designing a garment in episode 1 so I’d believe it
Apple Leather case. Had a couple for my 6s Plus as well, it’s the only case I enjoy having on my device. 
Especially since next week is a Ball, I’m sure they’ll have to sew one of their looks
Nvm I got my T mixed up. They said the episode with the feathers runway is won by either Asia or Aquaria, and Asia ended up winning the challenge 
T spiller who leaked Yuhua going 3rd just said that Mayhem goes home next week 👀 I’m shook 
I love this sub
You do know the girls asked Phi Phi for her opinion in all of those situations right? And it wasn’t Shakira, it was Sofia Vergara. The editors cut out the queens asking her for her opinion. 
Omg I live for this. This season really does feel like I’m watching one of the older seasons. It really captures that same magic. 
I mean there’s favoritism in the fans voting as well. To me it makes the award more special that the queens voted for it. They both deserved it equally so it’s not like anyone was “robbed”
Girl... all the girls in the cast LOVE Jaja. What show have you been watching? Tbh tho, I would’ve voted for Amadiva personally, although B Ella is one of my favs so I’m still glad she won
No she was not. The queens themselves voted for Miss Congeniality and they chose B Ella. They both deserved it equally. 
I love that the two big girls in the cast won the crown and Miss Congeniality
B Ella deserved Miss C just as much as Jaja. In fact, her fellow cast members voted her as Miss C, so we know it’s deserved. 
Omg that makes it even more special to me. I’m so happy B Ella won MC. She’s one of my favs from this cast. 
I was just thinking that. Natalia is a great first winner for Drag Race Thailand, but Année will make a great first winner for DRT All Stars!!
Did we watch the same AS2? She had a few shady moments but nothing crazy lmao
It’s a joke
Screaming 
Yeah but her elimination wouldn’t be that shocking if she only won one challenge lol
From what we know she’s one of the front runners until her shock elimination 
Do vegans have gross assholes???
I say winner chooses bottom 2 with a normal lip sync for your life format
The only acceptable twist tbh
You’re literally saying it’s curved. There’s no other meaning to that sentence lmfao. It’s either curved or flat. 
The screen is not curved lol. The entire display area is flat. The glass only curves at the edges. Works fine on my brothers LifeProof case with a built in screen protector. 
YOU GUYS ARENT LETTING ME FUCKING BREATHE LMFAOOOO
I mean it’s very obviously a joke lol nobody takes the smartphone wars seriously (I hope)
They were giving T about the Ball lmao. Vixen definitely didn’t make it to the ball. 
Top 6 is when Monét goes home. Vixen is 7th place.
I mean so was Shangela lmao
It’s been one queen each season that wasn’t new. Out of 14 that’s not a big deal. I agree that it’s becoming a tired gimmick but in my opinion Miss Vanjie is worth having back for S11. 
I’d love to see Dearis back in an All Stars season
Annee is always stunning 
If we have Monique for 7 episodes I’ll be very happy vs the rumors of her being the 4th out
Episode 7. I wonder if that’s when Monique goes home or Mayhem. 
And then Cracker broke her leg and went home 
Snatch Game is said to be around episode 7
Not a single person has mentioned a comeback queen. We would’ve known by now. 
Girl she made an entire dress out of hats and cards. Sit down. Her hair was made of plastic. She was robbed of a top spot. 
I had high hopes for B Ella when the first trailer came out. I knew she’d make it far. 
If she doesn’t even land in the bottom 3 all season I won’t be mad if they crown the bitch
I literally almost cried cuz I thought a bunch of people on the sub thought I was cringey lmao
I love that one of the darkest queens to be on the show is the most popular black queen. The GP tends to stan the lighter skin black queens so to see Bob get this type of recognition is a testament to her talent. 
Oh my god I need this in my life
They never said that? They said imagine the gag if it WAS. They don’t even know if the T they spilt is true which is why they were hesitant to post it in the first place 
I’m crying rn
The struggle when I had my One M8. Only owned 2 cases for that thing the entire 2 years I had it
You aren’t even real lmfao
I’d advise against playing dumb considering they’ll know you dropped your phone since the back is cracked 
Until the jury decides to put the 3rd and 4th place queens in the top 2
The shock from hitting the ground probably knocked out the connector for the camera or something
It’s all good. But thank you for the confirmation!! I had never heard about a double crowning for S9 before so I was confused when OP mentioned it. Didn’t think it was true. 
That’s not what a double crowning is sis. I know they filmed them both winning, I meant did they get filmed as double winners? 
Her mug and wig are gorgeous but her bodysuit is basic. But honestly, a lot of queens had basic looks this week
LMAOOO
Did they do a double crowning for season 9 too? Omg I never knew that
Someone once said on here that they filmed a top 2 as well (Asia and Aquaria apparently)
We heard about a Kalorie Vs Eureka lip sync months ago but it was rumored for episode 1
Can I sit on your face 

Edit: y’all bitches can downvote me all you want but that’s a MAN and I’m not ashamed 
Again, you can have a harsh contour and still be blended. 
Idk, Tyra and Violet were both like 21/22 when they won. But yeah, they’re trying to get the show more popular so I think VH1 may start pushing for the most marketable winner. 
Aquaria is fierce. We don’t really know what she’s capable of in terms of acting and improv since we’ve never seen her in that type of environment but I think she’ll surprise us. And if she makes it to the top, I could definitely see her snatching the crown. She would be the most marketable queen to crown out of the cast. 
Sis what are you even saying? Out here looking like a fool
Take your own advice sis. Not a Trixie stan, you’re literally just wrong lmao. 
Trixie’s mug is one of the most precise and blended mugs out of all the Ru girls. You can have a harsh contour and still be blended. 
They aren’t spilling T and never have claimed to spill actual T. They are just compiling T that gets sent around. Most of their order is going to be accurate cuz we’ve heard it before. 
You guys know they aren’t spilling T right? They’ve said so themselves they compiled T that has been sent to them and gets sent around a few users on here. It’s not entirely accurate but a lot of it may prove to be accurate. 
She’s literally had one confessional and it was her intro
I mean we’re 2 episodes in lmao there’s never much correct at first since we haven’t seen the whole season 
It’s just a microphone. The extra holes are to make it symmetrical 
Fr, Mayhem should’ve won this challenge. Imagine being the first queen to win the first two challenges in the season
My bad I’m a dumbass 
She’s not gonna be returning unfortunately. The person who spilled tonight’s bottom two and lip sync song said that Vanessa doesn’t come back. And Ru just tweeted tonight’s lip sync song and confirmed it. 
Lmfaoooo that’s exactly what I thought of as I typed that 😂😂😂
Once those dumbasses told everyone about the Xfinity bug it got patched almost immediately. I purposefully kept it a secret cuz I didn’t want it to get patched and I was hoping anyone else that used it would be smart enough to do the same. Unfortunately that’s not the case. 
You seem like you’re reaching for celebrity drama that isn’t there. Delusion. 
SCREAMING 
iPad mini 2 has A7 chip/1 GB RAM vs the A5/0.5 GB RAM in iPad mini 1 
When I was 14 my parents wouldn’t get me anything besides the cheapest Android phone Verizon was offering at the time lol. I’d just get the battery replaced or get him a standard sized iPhone 8. An X is way too much for a kid. That’s something he should be buying himself when he gets a job in a couple years. 
Lmao whenever I had a substitute teacher in high school
In my opinion, the A10 chip in an iPad for $329 sounds like a pretty good deal
OH MY GOD BIANCA
Lmfaoooo I love how shameless you are about this
You all right sis?
This is why you’re one of my favorite people on this sub. Always coming through with the receipts lmao 
Oooooo this changes shit sis
Aquaria is supposed to lip sync this week
Idk why this is getting dowmvoted lol I laughed
Oh, I was aware of the possibilities, I was just convinced I had it all figured out and I knew what I was doing. I was wrong. 
Well it’s not like it’ll be that much of a break, they’re both airing next year most likely. S11 is gonna start filming after S10 is over and AS4 will film right after that
...is that going to change what happened? I can’t go back and change it lmfao. When you’re a lonely 16 year old with no friends you’ll take whatever attention you can
...so I was taken advantage of and naive and you’re trying to come for me for it? Cute. I was 16. I literally don’t even hook up or meet with guys anymore because it’s kinda traumatizing. But thank you. 
Because I was horny and naive. Do you always ask people why they did something they regret? 
It’s still not right. When I look back at all the guys I hooked up with when I was 16 it doesn’t feel normal. No grown man should be fucking a teenager. And that’s the t. 
Ew
Aquaria was like 16 when she met Sharon lmao
I fucking screamed when I finally scrolled to Dusty and Roxxxy
Y’all are grasping at straws. You know what OP meant. Everyone on this sub was dragging Mayhem for that promo look
A lot of the queens have pics with each other during filming. Things seemed to have changed this time around
Bianca literally gets called out for wearing the same dress all the time lmfao. She even says it herself
Yeah but what argument are you trying to make anyways? Their point was that the judges choose who they come for to fit the narrative production is trying to create. Trixie literally wore blonde almost every single time in AS3 besides the 3 times you mentioned and nothing was said about it. 
Yeah but it’s not like she chose the brown wig lol it was assigned to her
Omg this look is sickening
I guess the T that the judging is gonna be really weird this season is gonna be true. I already believe the T that queens are gonna make it through for no reason and queens are gonna get cut for no reason 
She’s top 4 sis you’ll have to deal with her phat ass all season 💅🏼
Gia winning The Switch 2 and AS4 in the same year? I’m here for it 
Yup
Oh lordt 
It’s been one episode sis
I’m not calling her basic I’m literally talking about that one part of a lot of her looks. That’s why I said she’s capable of doing more 
I mean you can have an aesthetic and not be super basic. Sometimes it’s tasteful to have a basic chest area but a lot of the time it’s just a total cop-out
I’m crying like a little fag right now
I’m in New Hampshire and I’ve had Face ID work for me in 15 F weather lol
I’ve been a fan of Gaga’s since she first came around and I’m now 20. 10 year old me was bopping to Paparazzi and Starstruck lmao
Aquaria’s chest area in a lot of her looks has always been very lazy to me. She can do so much more than a belt on her chest or pasties. She’s capable of way more. And yeah, Cracker is well liked around here lol.
I just didn’t agree with what she said lol. She took a general conversation and made a statement way past the scope of what they were saying. I was getting my jush while it was happening but it def rubbed me the wrong way
I agree; I appreciate what she does and how she likes to make political statements with her looks as well
Vixens outfit was plastic tubes tied around her body and a bra and panties. That’s not a look. I commend her for trying something different but it wasn’t constructed well. 

And I think everyone’s issue with what Vixen said in Untucked was saying that Cracker faked it to season 10 just because they have a similar beat, knowing absolutely nothing about Cracker and what she has done to get to where she is. They were talking about Cracker “copying” Aquaria and she just ran ahead and tried to invalidate all of Cracker’s hard work and  talent. 
Girl this is the sub that refers to Kandy Muse as Fat Aja lmao I’ll be fine 
Fat Farrah Moan looks so good
Cracker had that brim of the hat going around her entire chest and neck area and it looked like an actual garment, not pasties. That’s not comparable lol. 
I feel like we coulda got more drama if there was a gold room and a silver room like we used to. The producers are really underestimating how much easier it is to encite drama when you let the two groups of girls have their own convos and THEN put them together. 
...and that makes it right? They’re friends NOW. But I’m sure if Vixen went around saying that shit now they prolly wouldn’t be friends lol. I’m glad she’s instigating drama cuz this show has been boring but at least be RIGHT when you start drama. 
Kameron could’ve done a shorter wig and lost the cape and this look would’ve been immaculate 
Tbh, I have a hard time finding Charlie funny. I know there’s an audience that finds her funny but I’ve never laughed at any of her videos 
SCREAMING 
It is casting currently tho. I hope they make better decisions in terms of challenges this time
They’re sisters lmao
Yeah her hat and her hair were a lot and covered her face a lot. Wasn’t a fan of that. The Vixens look may have been different but tbh it was so poorly constructed (in my opinion)
At least Kamerons look looked finished tbh
AHHHHHH
LMFAOOOOO
Omg imagine if Jaja comes back and makes top 3
The clock would move up to the top when there’s notifications. Just like on my old Moto X
Wait they’re gonna be paired with eliminated queens next week?
I love how she refers to herself as the twerk queen but she can’t twerk.. lmao
Weren’t you trying to say that Aquaria got thrown off at top 4? You’re telling us that the first eliminated queen gets brought back at the top 4? Girl. Quit posting your fan fiction 
Tbh tho, I really admired how she wasn’t fake at all with any of the girls and actually spoke her mind, until she dragged Blair into it and couldn’t just tell Aquaria how she felt about her look on her own. She was def intimidated by Aquaria
I would love to see Jinkx come back and compete again. She could be the first queen to get two crowns 👀
They didn’t have a lip sync the week Gaga guest judged. Tbh I’m surprised they haven’t had Just Dance or Poker Face for lip syncs yet
I love John Wayne but it’s not a lip syncing song. If they wanted a song from Joanne they should’ve done Dancin In Circles or A-Yo
I won’t be surprised if their target is 2020 but they probably won’t make that deadline regardless 
The news is coming from a reliable source lol. This is the second time we’ve heard about it, which shows they’re definitely working on something foldable, even if they never bring it to the market 
We need more Vanessa. I hope the producers see that they fucked up sending her home lol
Maybe they’re trying to make it season 3 part 2? One returning queen and many sewing challenges. Maybe they’re trying to make it easier for Aquaria to rack up some challenge wins 
Honestly wasn’t a fan. She could’ve done more. 
I love Monet but that dress was a CHOICE. They got round from Vanessa but I got round from Monet’s dress too. 
I honestly thought she was gonna be in the bottom when they announced her with Monet and The Vixen
Continue to be confident in our top 4. The first three out were always interchangeable and never really set in stone. 
I’m sorry but Aquaria’s look was not top worthy. The Vixen and Monet should have been low tbh
IMO, this cast could give us an AS2 level season:

Adore Delano
Ongina
Courtney Act
Darienne Lake
Pearl
Trinity Taylor
Robbie Turner
Jessica Wild
Sharon Needles
Shea Couleé 
Valentina
The Princess

I, for one, hope to see them increase the cast to 12 queens next time around. 
The entire season is 2 hours of Drag Race. 90 minute episodes with half an hour of Untucked
Trust and believe the top 4 we have is true though. The first two out were always interchangeable. I’ve been told who the first out is and y’all won’t be happy lol. Not much longer to wait. 
That’s the point lol she has an earbud in listening to music
Imagine Kameron ends up being the first out and all the T we had on season 10 was wrong
The users that run the T checker get more info than they put out. The t spillers trust them not to spill anything about their identity and stuff. They have some reliable sources. The top 4 we’re sure of at this point but I won’t be surprised if Kalorie isn’t the first out like we thought
Are we sure it’s on her head? It looks like she’s bald and that belongs to a queen behind her
Ugh I don’t get why they couldn’t go back to the old untucked with the silver room and the gold room
Nina’s peach look won her that challenge so don’t try it little boy
Omg I totally saw Amadiva making it further I’m shook
I remember someone posting on here that they saw a teaser with one clip from untucked and it looked like old untucked and not the one from S7-S8
They’ve done it before lol S6 had no double sashay and there was a double shantay. They plan many extra challenges just in case anyways so it’s not like it’s specifically for that 
I mean don’t get me wrong, I agree that Ginger got a raw deal on AS2. They told her that AS2 would be her only shot at All Stars so she took the offer. I just think that in the grand scheme of things Katya deserved to be there over Ginger in that moment based on Katya winning a challenge the week prior and showing immense growth since S7
I was rebutting their argument that Ginger had a good track record 
Katya just won the week prior and Ginger was safe lol
I love Ginger but I’m glad Alyssa eliminated her over Katya. Katya still had so much to show. Ginger wasn’t really giving us anything different from season 7 whereas Katya had really blossomed in such a short amount of time
It’s been there since at least iOS 2.0 cuz I remember doing it on my 2nd gen iPod Touch lol
Is it considered offensive to joke about Blair being 12?
She looks so stunning omg
Black Jesus

This is what I think my top 5 most listened to probably is
I mean tomato tomahto girl people are shitty either way so I guess it doesn’t matter. My thing about social media is how people don’t look at it as being real so they say whatever they want but they’d never say it to anyone in person 
That doesn’t really change the fact that it’s misused by the general public lol
Darienne was funny as fuck. She was a gem in untucked
I really thought I’d miss Touch ID but tbh I forget Face ID is even there half the time. I just lift my phone and swipe up and it unlocks immediately. It takes some time for it to learn your face well but then it becomes nearly flawless
Yeah it’s all from Reddit. They didn’t have AS3 completely correct either but they were close
It’s his face 
Nah, social media is toxic. Majority of people don’t know how to use it properly 
Considering what we know about the top 4 we already know this isn’t true lmao
I swear there’s not enough Albanian fish on here
Omg relatable but I’m Albanian 
They should make the final 4 be a challenge again and have the legacy lip sync determine the top 3
I could definitely do with the challenge winner choosing the bottom 2. I wanna see these queens lip sync for their life and put on a performance. 
Are you saying Alaska doesn’t make music cuz she puts a lot of effort into her shit 
It’s not like the white runway had any connection to the show either lol
Literally
“Hey”
Tbh if they bring another winner back it’ll probably be Sharon Needles. She has stated that she wants to go back so I could see her slaying AS4
I remembering seeing that filming would start near the end of S10 but before it ends
That’s the formula VH1 lives by. They’re going to run Drag Race into the ground tbh. They’ve already started alienating the fan base with AS3
I’m pretty sure AS4 is filming this summer so I’m assuming queens from S10 will be eligible but not S11 since it’ll only have just finished filming when they film AS4
Alaska’s ex never said she won. Just that she was the most likely to win. They filmed Alaska, Katya, and Detox all winning AS2, and they did the same for AS3 (filmed both Trixie and Kennedy winning). 
Yeah I don’t think any of the queens are gonna shade Trixie for winning, she didn’t vote for the top 2 lol
It was probably to Shangela not even making top 2
If Aquaria has any of Sharon’s wit she could win Snatch Game 
When did Bebe deserve to be in the bottom?
I loved my white 5C. Id buy an X with that polycarbonate body again tbh. I enjoyed the hell out of that thing 
I love Katya so much 
I think you’re looking for an argument lol. I have my opinion and you have yours. We can disagree. 
I didn’t lmfao I said if. It was a hypothetical situation. She’s the most marketable winner out of the 4 so even if she has the worst track record out of them all she still has a high chance of winning. 
Key word IF, sis. None of us know what her track record is like
Compared to Shea she was mediocre 
Omg really? I had no idea Kim was gonna be on AS3! I’m so glad she didn’t honestly 
Ongina didn’t drop out, she got shortlisted. Val dropped out from AS3. 
No just Sasha and Trixie lol. Aquaria would be the third if she wins with a mediocre track record 
I’m assuming that means a queen pulled someone’s lipstick but they didn’t win the lip sync and the winner didn’t choose them to go home 
Omg this looks so good
Omg Bebe looks so fucking fierce 
This makes me so happy 
Jesus Christ people act like Bebe killed someone. She didn’t make any different decision about eliminating Aja than Trixie did lmao. The only remotely “bad” thing she has done is not reveal her lipsticks last week. 
Because she references Africa a lot people always say she’s been bringing the same thing. News flash y’all, Africa is a CONTINENT, not a country. The only look of hers this season that disappointed me is her finale look. She was never the worst in any of the challenges so idk why people say she doesn’t belong there. 
You took me there sis
An extreme example? More like a POOR example. To be critiquing the man who runs our country is JUSTIFIED. To attack a DRAG QUEEN who doesn’t attack others with racial slurs is NEVER justifiable. This is what I’m talking about!!! She does nothing to deserve the hate she gets. Why go out of your way to attack a queen that does nothing to bother anyone? You’re making this into something it’s not. 
Did you just compare a drag queen to Donald Trump? Kennedy is consistently attacked with racist comments sis. You guys are grasping at straws here. All I said was that she doesn’t deserve to be hated on.
But she doesn’t deserve nearly the amount of hate she gets. You can not like someone and shut up too
Wtf I didn’t say anything about anyone’s Instagram 
Yeah but the black queens hate usually never goes away
She made it to the top 4 twice and the fan base still hates on her smh
I love Gaga but I really hope this isn’t true 😂😂😂
I’m sure they looked at track records when choosing the winner. I doubt they’re scoring in a complicated way like you’re trying to say but I’m sure they looked at the queens placements throughout the season to decide who won. There’s no other way around it lol. It was always about track record. 
Wtf are you on lmfaooo
It was from the same source that told us that Dela self eliminated and Trixie bombed Snatch Game. Naive confirmed the T from this source 
AS1 IS worse than S1 because S1 actually had decent challenges and there wasn’t TEAMS
Still kills me to this day 😂
How did Gaga fuck up lol the producers planned everything all she did was show up and do her job 
Supposedly Vanessa lip syncs twice and Eureka is supposed to lip sync first episode and send Kalorie home but tbh I might just be jumbling up a bunch of unreliable T 😂
Reading is fundamental
“I know someone that’s bisexual so I can tell they aren’t bisexual cuz they aren’t the same” this is how stupid you sound. You have no idea what someone’s real sexual orientation is because you are not in their head.
If the final lip sync actually matters like in Season 9, Trixie really doesn’t stand a chance against Kennedy
You’re gonna tell me the acting challenge she won in season 3 was Shangela being Shangela?
For AS3 too but they never used it for either
Oh yeah, I wasn’t referencing this T tho. I was referencing the top 2 and top 4 that first got leaked last summer after filming. It was the source that leaked Dela self eliminating and Naive confirmed that it was true. We won’t know for sure anyways until it airs but I’m betting on the top 2 being a combination of Trixie and Bebe/Kennedy
Wdym? It was the T that naive confirmed last year lol they didn’t really detail any episodes besides Trixie bombing Snatch Game 
I thought Trixie and Bebe was the original T we had? Nobody really knows what’s going to happen next week tbh
I hope you have some friends in the real world cuz you won’t find many here with that personality lol
Tbh as the finale comes closer I’m slowly accepting that we’re not going to get a “deserving” winner in the traditional sense but the fan base is still gonna explode. I’ve even gotten myself to be ok with Kennedy winning after seeing her finale look 😂😂
Do not even TRY me sis go through my comments and I’m the furthest thing from a Trixie stan you will meet. I loved her finale look, sue me. 
Trixie looks so good tho??
Girl the episode aired 2 days ago you’re definitely not first 
Oh wow, I never saw that T. I remember the T saying Shangie was a 3 time loser but I remember all of us being convinced she at least made top 4
It needs a diff color scheme that’s for sure
Forreal, it’s not like the top 4 queens made any decisions that changed the outcome 
Come on sis it isn’t that bad. It just needs to be tweaked a little bit
I literally don’t remember this at all lol everyone was banking on Shangela making it to the end
Yes
Yup. Every queen in the top 3 from season 4 forward was filmed winning (top 2 for AS1, S9, and AS3)
I’m surprised that more people want Kennedy to win than Bebe
Nope, everyone’s betting on the top 4 being Kameron, Eureka, Aquaria, and Asia. Some of them have already gotten some details right (new workroom, silver elimination statues)
Because she already knew for the reunion lol. They had the queens watch the rest of the season before they filmed the reunion
They mean it wasn’t a bad look so it’s not like she was gonna be in the bottom for it
I don’t think they’ve shown us anything past episode 3. T spiller that has already spilled accurate T says Blair is either second or 3rd out
The entire trailer is in the Twitter post I linked to lol it’s a direct link to the trailer 
Val decided to back out and wait for another All Stars season 
I really hope Monet slays this season
Right? I’m more excited for S10 than I was for AS3 lmao. I don’t even care for the outcome of AS3 anymore
Omg that’s in the t checker!!!
Head to r/spoileddragrace and you’ll find out the top 4 lol
I think S10 may actually turn out to be on par with S6. But tbh I say this every year 😂
Um the top 4 is basically almost certain to be Kameron, Eureka, Aquaria, and Asia at this point lol. This t is cold
Eureka making top 4 doesn’t surprise me tbh
I do think she was trying to say something offensive in her original tweet but I deleted my post just cuz I don’t wanna give into the mob mentality of crucifying every queen for breathing 
Sis we all know what she was trying to get at
Right? She was endearingly likable until that tweet
Low and bottom 2 aren’t the same thing in this sense. When you’re low you aren’t up for elimination but you got bad critiques. I always forget about the Ball cuz tbh the only queens that did badly were the ones that were in the bottom. 
I almost agreed with you but we have to be accurate sis. Trinity was low once and high 2 times. 
No it means Kim Chi is the one leaking the T lol
Yeah VH1 is trying to get their moneys worth so I think they’re gonna make as many Drag Race seasons as they can while the show is relevant. All Stars is definitely going to become less special if it becomes a yearly thing. AS2 was so worth the wait but I love seeing these queens on my TV so I’m at peace with it lol
It’s in the S10 t checker, AS4 is already being planned. Last year Shea said that we’d see it be filmed this summer so I think All Stars might become a yearly thing now
I’m def buying the top 5 T, and I’m so happy that Eureka made it to the end
Are you buying the new T?
No they said we’d be seeing the cast at the finale, also Valentina is basically confirmed for AS4 and I bet we’ll see either Shea or Trinity on as well
You answered your own question lol. You corroded the oleophobic coating when you used an alcohol based wipe 
I just hope they do a normal format for once. I want one challenge winner and I wanna see the queens lip sync for their life again. These are queens that have already competed and don’t want their reputation tarnished so I bet we would get some amazing lip syncs. It doesn’t have to be a bunch of twists and turns to be good TV. 
No it’s Vivienne Pinay
So I’m not the only one??? I always forget Sharon won that challenge and always remember Chad. Maybe it’s cuz Chad was memorable in the challenge and had a good runway?
Yeah, Cynthia’s MTQ video and promo look weren’t released until after she was introduced at the beginning of episode 2, whereas Eureka was included in the S10 cast announcement. 
Yeah there’s definitely more queens on the left we can’t see. Everyone is there. It would be pointless to introduce 3 queens later in the episode. 
$47 is accurate cuz when you multiply it by 24 it comes out to the full $1149
Tbh I’m fine with them just doing a normal format for once. Clear challenge winner and lip sync for your life for the bottom 2. These queens could pull off some legendary lip syncs to stay in the game. 12 queens for AS4 Vh1 make it happen
You’re supposed to make your use of memes funny sis 
Imagine if she chose Chi Chi 
It can help the overall life of your battery last longer (theoretically)
It says Trixie sends home Morgan lol
Bebe winning 3 challenges in a row? I’m ok with this
I get not liking an artist but why call them untalented just cuz you don’t like their music? Sis can fuckin sing lol that’s a talent
I’m not saying that at all lmao all I said was that it made me uncomfortable 
Have you ever looked? You can see it sometimes lol
Girl what? She said some real shit 
Whose lipsticks did you pick? Spill the beans sis
Sis idk why everyone’s trying to find a hole in my logic when political figures make me anxious period lol. That’s all there is to my comment.
I understand the importance of it. It just makes me anxious lol
IM DYING LMFAOOOO
I’m a democrat but it made me uncomfortable only cuz Drag Race is a way for me to unhinge from the world and the anxieties come back when I get reminded of politics lol
3 episodes in and Annee already won 2 main challenges so I hope she’ll take the crown tbh. My top 4 is Annee, Natalia,  Dearis and Amadiva. With Jaja rounding out the top 5
That’s why I hope either Shangela or Trixie win cuz the fans would murder Kennedy and Bebe
Apparently Porkchop had something in her contract with Botched that prevented her from being on TV for a few years so I’m almost certain we’ll see her come back for All Stars since she wants to. The first eliminated queen ever deserves another chance. She is so respected in the pageant circuit and she’s such a fierce queen. Sewing just isn’t her strength. 
How can someone lack this much self awareness? Sis... mess. 
The reunion aired 2 weeks after the finale iirc 
Threats aren’t funny xoxo
When are people gonna get that threats ain’t cute?
Apparently she was just shortlisted and her injury had nothing to do with it. She had a part for Divas Live and all of her outfits and I guess they changed their mind and told her not to come
Right? When she said “you’re gonna be curious for the rest of your life” I was like yaaasssss bitch!!😂😂
Ohhhhh ok
B Ella has been in the bottom? I haven’t seen past episode 2 yet so idk lol
U/ajalikespotatosalad how does it feel to be the fan favorite now?
It’s not talking about the status bar icon. It’s literally right there on the screen lol. Do you not see the purple and gray icons?
Yes!! 11 queens is plenty, I’d love to see them all come back 
They’re also trying to make a living so I’m sure they need the coins they’re gonna get from being at Drag Con
Some people are just a fan of the company lol, I say let them be
Tbh I just think that trans women and queer men should be the only ones competing in Drag Race. I mean, they are the ones who pioneered the art of drag in its current form
If people like the boxes why are we to judge them? It’s literally a box. Worry about people who are actually doing something negative to the world instead
If number 3 turns out accurate then I can’t see how they’ll justify crowning Trixie if Bebe is in the top 2 with her. Unless Bebe declines the title
None of the phones have intel processors lol don’t spread around misinformation. Some phones have Intel radios and some have Qualcomm radios but they ALL have a TSMC-made Apple designed processor. 
I don’t display my boxes but how does this make someone creepy? They’re fucking boxes lmfao. This is no different than people putting up a bunch of sports memorabilia around their house. It’s something that interests them. No reason to rag on people for something they enjoy. 
She was only in the bottom once and only safe once lol Jinkx placed high for literally every single challenge in between those. Sometimes performance matters more and Jinkx DELIVERED
Trixie says she’s white all the time tho
Panties, bitch
This has literally been posted a million times
No they didn’t lmfao. Two different people sis look in the t checker 
The T spiller that said that has not been proven wrong yet

https://imgur.com/gallery/p45jh
You know Ru barely knows anything about these girls right? She got mashed potato brains sis she can’t remember shit unless it happened in the 80s
Well I mean nothing is confirmed until it happens lol it would just make sense with the T that Shangela sends home the most girls
Shangela 
Delete it fat
Why are you annoyed about my opinion lol I view them tied sorry sis. Sasha’s performance was more consistent
It’s all subjective 🤷🏼‍♂️ I view them as tied lol. Sasha was high in 5 challenges and won 2, Trinity was high in 2 challenges and won 3. Throw in the fact that Trinity lip synced and they seem pretty even to me. 
I tied Sasha and Trinity for 2nd and 3rd because Sasha placed high consistently and only placed low once whereas Trinity lip synced, placed low once and only placed high in the challenges she won (edit: that part was wrong)
God I love Chi Chi so much 
It’s because it’s easier for them to create storylines with acting challenges cuz they can edit queens to look better than they were, whereas you can’t edit a sewing challenge. 
Shangela in the bottom for an acting challenge? I don’t believe it one bit tbh
Clockedt omg

This is what I get for arguing with ppl at 5 AM and then I forget what I was arguing about 
You literally went back and edited all of your comments you trick ass bitch 
“we’re in America though” your argument ended right there lol
My reasoning for calling you out is that you’re responding to comments about the hate she’s getting for being unapologetically African and justifying it lmfao
Why are you defending people hating on Bebe for referencing Africa on every post lol
Every other contestant referenced American “culture” in everything lol. Africa is an entire continent and she has referenced different countries and cultures and she has only done it 3 times lmao. 
Dear diary 
It’s not the same person lol
Oh, here’s the tea
Holy fuck Kim’s mug is flawless 
Sasha was consistently in the top throughout the entire season lol we are talking about a queen having a mediocre track record and winning. Trixie was in the bottom twice and only won one challenge so far. There’s only one more challenge to win and if she isn’t top 2 next week she’ll officially be the winner with the worst track record. 
Again, like I just said only 2 producers saw and knew what she was doing and they decided to just let her try it. I’m pretty sure Ru had no idea. Her reaction seemed genuine tbh. And Bebe lost that lip sync as soon as she took her wig off. 
Apparently the producers tried to convince her to stay afterwards. Only 2 producers saw what she was doing when she wrote her own name on the lipstick
No clue lol but that’s what they did 
I think the person that runs the T checker said they edited the picture to protect the identity of whoever sent this to them
The fact that you get it shows you’re not that girl 👍🏼 hope u have a good day jush
Why are you apologizing? I’m literally just trying to educate some people. You brought yourself into this lol I didn’t mention you at all
Because it’s the truth. Everyone still wants Trixie to win with such a mediocre track record but none of the black queens would make it out alive being crowned with that track record. It literally has a huge effect on how the fans view a queen if they’re black. It’s not even something done purposefully, it’s a subconscious reaction that has been instilled into white people over the years and nobody is doing anything to stop it
Pretty sure I wasn’t responding to your comment lol I was adding onto what the person I responded to said 
Who said anything about you? You reacting this way about it speaks volumes lmao
But you already know if a black queen won with her track record they’d be read for filth
No lol they filmed multiple crownings for the top 3
I still cannot get over how the placements were almost swapped for S9. Shea shoulda been 1st, Trinity/Sasha for 2nd and 3rd, and Peppermint 4th. I love peppermint but with that track record she had no place being the runner up. 
I’m almost positive it was Trixie, they def didn’t show Bebe saying there was a sign of resolution with Trixie for no reason
$25,000
I’m glad Milk at least got to shine in a challenge after her mediocre run
I feel attacked tbh
Who’s in the top tho 
I’d vogue to her verse over a better beat lol
Right? Why is everyone so mad lol
I was so pissed that people were making it public like wtf!! can’t let anyone have nothing nice smh
There was probably a lot of producer fuckery and she probs got tired of it
They also said all the eliminated queens confront the queens that eliminated them. Aja confronts Bebe about not telling the judges she helped her with the dress and apparently Morgan clocks Dela
You mean BALEGDEH
Dela and Bebe top 2, the rest of the top 5 is in the bottom
And EVERYONE was convinced it was fake lol
She would rather be called Dela, she doesn’t want to be called Ben
Tbh it’s not as bad as everyone is saying. It’s been trendy lately to view Bebe as not performing as well as she is. And she may very well put on a performance on the main stage that justifies a top 2 placement. 
Not reliable T lol. Naivesmalls has basically been right this whole time. I’m almost guaranteed it’s gonna be Bebe and Trixie. The only other T spiller that alluded to Kennedy being top 2 is already wrong since Morgan didn’t eliminate Dela
With Bebe reportedly not being on the bottom at all and sending Morgan home next week, we may very well see Bebe take the crown again 

PM me I have it lol it’s Dela with a lipstick she wrote her name on with whiteout
No the person that originally leaked the outcome said Trixie is in the bottom. Dela and Bebe top 2,  everyone else (besides eliminated queens) in the bottom
oh my god
THERES A SCREENSHOT OF IT OMG
I told them to delete it cuz they were on the main sub and I didn’t want them to get banned but I screenshotted it lol
https://imgur.com/gallery/yXEPi
The few songs fans heard at filming for A Star is Born apparently were bops so I have high hopes for this soundtrack 
Delete this so you don’t get banned from this sub sis. But I’m not surprised at all
Night of 1000 Cher’s and Cher guest judging? I’m honestly so excited. There was T about a Cher musical challenge too omg. I’m gooped sis. 
How much do u know about S10? Do u think the leaked top 4 is right?
Im honestly glad they didn’t change it. It wouldn’t feel the same with a different runway. I wouldn’t care if they made it bigger or changed just a few things around in the workroom, but I want the show to always keep its overall aesthetic. Watching drag race is like my safe space lol
Only T they gave was that Mayhem wins the first challenge and they just confirmed Aquaria for top 4 (which isn’t surprising)
Omg so could the T that Cher is a guest judge be true?
https://imgur.com/gallery/NAlWj
Was that the brick that killed people?
We haven’t seen the season yet. Eureka never performed badly on S9 lol she was a pretty fierce competitor. Now she kinda knows what to expect and spent the entire year between seasons knowing she was coming back and prepared herself. She may very well deserve to win. 
I live for Aunty Chan omg 😂😂😂
There was lol Ongina showed hers off after she got snubbed from AS3
Delete fat
...that’s a week
Yeah cuz they NEVER come true 
The skin is purple, it’s Nina. A lot of them had jackets that they didn’t wear in the official promo 
...and?
There’s a week between the seasons lol it’s not like S10 starts airing the day after AS3 ends 
Check settings > General > accessibility > increase contrast. See if reduce transparency is turned on 
You’re literally on beta software lmao there’s always bugs. Stfu. 
Right? 😂😂
Omg idk who to pick as my flair they all look so fierce 
Right? It reminds me of cotton candy lol I love it. Idk why everyone’s reading her for it
They did it for AS1 too
Ok but I’m really living for this promo theme 
I care about people coming for any of the black queens tbh. They get enough hate just for being black, I’ll always defend them unless they kill someone lol. Nina’s Mexico comment still don’t sit right with me tho
Last year Shea said that AS4 was gonna be filmed this summer. She declined AS3 and probably already accepted for AS4 since apparently production has already reached out to a few queens. 
That wasn’t what caused her to come for her though lmao. Aquaria didn’t bat an eye when Nina said all that. She literally randomly decided to completely read Nina’s drag because she was annoyed that people liked what they saw. It was during the beginning of S9. 
Pre cast announcement people were living for her, after the MTQ were released there was a lot of hate thrown Aja’s way. I think people were annoyed at how hyped she was so people started to get annoyed with her in general. 
We can talk about her reading Nina for filth on twitter completely unprovoked lol. She blocked me after I called her out
People found her boring
Yeah but she jumped 30k in one day lol
They’re always gonna stan for the white twink first 
It’s funny cuz Alaska was a clear 3rd place in season 5 lol
Right? I was almost convinced that Katya could still win but Alaska still deserved the crown 
Trixie’s Bitchelor performance was hilarious lmfao. She completely sold the character in a funny way, Milk just kept interrupting her and fucked up her flow. 
Lmfaooooo
I know lmfao. Read my other response. I’ve read all the T as soon as it gets spilled. I’m abnormally obsessed lol. I’m just saying that the person isn’t real because they aren’t the real u/illnevertellu and just compiled a bunch of T and is pretending it’s real. But no reliable T spiller has actually leaked any top 2 queens for future challenges besides Dela winning next week 
Am I the only one that enjoys the winner edit? It makes the winner feel justified (to me, at least)
AS2, AS3, and season 9 are definitely my favorite promos
One of them is making a joke lol. S8 was filmed before AS2. But they filmed basically back to back, I’m pretty sure they started filming for AS2 like a day after S8 ended filming 
The challenge was to wear clothes lol. All of the looks the queens wore were looks they brought with them for the runway. It was mostly a pointless episode. Only redeeming part for me was that Gaga was there lol
Sucks that the only challenge Nina won was barely even a challenge :/
I remember a T spiller saying there was an elimination the first episode
You really should bet on it. Obviously the T of Morgan coming back and Dela leaving next week is true because we heard about it last year lmao. But they literally created a new username to make it look exactly like a known leaker, it ain’t T sis. They’re trying to be u/illnevertellu but they used uppercase I’s instead of lowercase L’s. 
Yeah except this user made a fake username that looks similar to an old leaker but it isn’t them lol. It’s purely fan fiction
Katya herself admitted that she lost that lip sync fairly, she said she didn’t know the words and they edited her to look better than it actually was
Tbh, wasn’t a fan of Trinity’s makeover look. I love Trinity but Sasha should’ve won that challenge, and it would’ve made her win be a little more justified. 
You seem dark sided lol relax and stop putting so much negativity into the world 
Tbh I’m already not liking what VH1 has been doing to Drag Race but I’m cool with the idea of bringing back AS1 queens and Ginger and Adore. I’d be cool with Thorgy coming back some day too tbh
I don’t buy the new T. I’ve been very weary about any new T that has popped up about S10 and AS3. I think WOW is trying to put false T out there to throw us off. I think a lot of the older S10 T we have is gonna end up being true
Who cares if they were already on All Stars? We already know casting has been looking at previous All Stars queens to bring back in a future season 
sjdjdjdn
Feel free to slide in my DMs. I send hole pics

Edit: he never came for the hole pics 
The 8 Plus may have a physically smaller battery but the lower resolution LCD display takes up less power so the battery lasts waaaay longer on the 8 Plus
I wanna sit on his face he’s so fine
Aja isn’t white lmfaooo (even tho it is her)
Add everything to a playlist and press the download button on the playlist. That’s how I got all my music downloaded when I got a new phone
They haven’t really spilled anything at all lol. The episode goes up an hour early on Xfinity and that’s how they posted screenshots of last nights episode. They haven’t seen anything past last nights episode and have been making up any new T they’ve “spilled”. They even deleted a bunch of their comments. 
It’s cold T sis. u/mattblau hasn’t leaked anything lol. They just have Xfinity and get to watch the episode an hour before it airs. They haven’t seen anything past last nights episode. 
They haven’t seen the episode. They haven’t actually seen Trixie’s crowning. They went back and deleted a bunch of their comments. They saw last nights episode early because the episode goes up early on Xfinity (I’ve watched every episode early because of this). They haven’t leaked anything at all. 
No lol, which is why I think this person is now just trying to give us bullshit T. He saw the episode early with Xfinity (as did a lot of us) but next weeks episode isn’t up. The screenshot in this post is from the preview. He hasn’t provided us any new T at all and definitely hasn’t seen next weeks episode. 
I honestly do think Bebe was in the wrong for not giving Aja any credit for the help she gave her. Like sis, Aja just got read for filth by the judges and you couldn’t just give her some credit to lighten the blow? I love Bebe a lot but this episode def showed her in a negative light. Especially with her reading Aja her obituary during deliberations. 
Aja helped her with the Leotard underneath, Bebe put together everything else. If Bebe walked out with just the leotard underneath, then she would’ve been in the bottom. Aja’s help to her outfit didn’t help Bebe get to the top. 
Supermodel and Covergirl aren’t the same song lol. It’s a remix of Supermodel from Essential vol. 1 or 2
If Trixie is in the top again then I’m 100% ok with her winning. Which also means that T spiller is false saying that she floats dead in the water all season
Yeah I have a feeling AS2 is gonna be the only good All Stars season we get
I’m sure everyone had something shady to say about all the queens, I think they only included Aja’s confessionals to create an Aja vs Bebe storyline which leads to Aja voting against Bebe during the finale
But they never released it that early. I check Xfinity multiple times a day and it doesn’t show up until an hour before airing
They had to cancel Milk in AS3 to make room for Kameron
Right? 😂 watching it I was like AQUARIA THOSE STATEMENTS MEAN THE SAME THING
Honestly the ugliest promo look out of them all
The thing is, Nina only hates Aquaria because she said some messy things about Nina on Twitter and ragged on her drag. Aquaria is messy af lol. 
Why does everyone say this? That doesn’t mean these kids aren’t gonna do it lol
What do you mean? We been knew Aja was gonna go home this week
I mean, did you watch the episode? She was painted pretty negatively (even tho she still did what was shown) and the Aja stan twinks on Twitter and Instagram are gonna send her racial slurs almost guaranteed 
RELAX ITS TV
I really hope the fans lash out at how scripted tonight’s episode was. Drag Race has never felt this unnatural before. VH1 needs to stop. 
Honestly don’t see what everyone hates about it. I loved it. I thought it fit the theme. Aja’s wasn’t disco. Kennedy’s was basic but it was disco and it was gorgeous. 
Drag Race actually sold out lol. Didn’t think it would happen but it did. It has never been THIS scripted. 
When that happened I was like damn Bebe wtf 
Yeah but Kennedy still performed better in this challenge. Unfortunately it was Aja’s time to go. Someone still has to go home every week. 
It is Chi Chi, I saw the episode and you can see her tattoos
Chi Chi is there
I’m mad that these bitches couldn’t keep quiet about the Comcast shit lol they’re gonna patch it as soon as WOW looks at this sub
They definitely included that scene on purpose cuz it’s mentioned a few times 
I don’t think Bebe is gonna be ok. I just finished the episode and it definitely paints her negatively. The fans are not gonna let this go. Tbh the whole episode seemed like super scripted. 
I just finished the episode, and damn Bebe is definitely given the “villain” edit this week. They def wanted to make Aja appear robbed.
Yes, the official RuPaul’s Drag Race twitter account confirmed it and Sasha tweeted about it too
Well that’s what the fucking competition is lmfaoooo it’s not just Aja vs one queen 😂😂
Did she tho? We literally barely saw anything. For all we know all Aja helped her sew is the base of something that Bebe tricks the fuck out and makes it look glamorous.

Since you got it from a third party, there’s a big chance that the battery they gave you is a lower capacity than what Apple puts in them. I don’t trust third party parts tbh. 
You’d have to be a stupid ass bitch to not know that, they’re saying that’s what it reminded them of lmfao
I remember Ru said they filmed AS3 so far from LA that he had to stay in a hotel during filming. If they redesigned the set they could’ve been building it while filming AS3 
Easy, we did notice it. It’s just that not everything is as cryptic as we think it is. 
They gave a lot of specific T about the queens soup cans tho, which seems pretty committed for someone making up fake T. I believe it tbh, I saw last weeks episode a few hours before it aired lol
Someone leaked the outcome of tonight’s episode cuz they managed to see it early. Top 2 is supposed to be Bebe and Trixie, Bebe wins the lip sync and sends Aja home. 
u/RealityTVLeaks? u/RealityTVLeaks? Oh my fuckin god she fuckin dead
I think we’re jumping to conclusions and should wait for the actual episode to air. We don’t know if Bebe asked for help or if Aja offered to help. We actually don’t know jack shit till we see it haha. And Bebe literally never said she needed Aja to sew it cuz she couldn’t. 
Did Aja make her outfit? Didn’t seem to get that from a MINUTE LONG CLIP. Sis, we don’t see it all. Don’t jump to conclusions. Aja simply helped her get started. If it’s Aja and Shangela in the bottom, Shangela shouldn’t go home based on how she has won two lip syncs so far. 
I’m on the mobile app and I can see it lol
Dear diary 

If it’s Shangela and Aja in the bottom this week then Aja is the one that has to go, sorry. Aja has set the stage on fire with her pussy this season, she has truly redeemed herself from S9.
Too bad for you, Reddit app shows a preview of the link sis. You tried it tho. 
They’re all going to be interviewed by Sasha tonight after AS3. They aren’t gonna be at their usual viewing parties. 
We still have Dragula coming during off season so I think we’ll be ok haha
I’ve been watching the episodes early cuz a certain TV streaming service has been unlocking them early and nobody has been checking lol. I’m loving it. Usually isn’t unlocked until a few hours before airing tho so u definitely hit the jackpot 😂
I mean tonight’s Warhol Ball is only 2 looks too so maybe it doesn’t have to be 3 looks 
I LOVE THIS ONE
I’ve contemplated it a lot recently lol, I’ll keep trying!
Go off, sis. It’s clear that this world is irreversibly fucked and that the black queens are never going to be treated equally.
I mean not really but sure!
Ok girl, just gotta say one last thing before I sashay away!! Why is it so easy for y’all to assume Charlie’s response was a joke but Shea just HAS to be bitter? Qwhite interesting to me if I say so myself. Shea didn’t like what was said behind her back and said something about it, originally as a joke and then got defensive when everyone started coming for her. She clearly knows Charlie better than we do, so why is everyone immediately wanting to go against Shea when she has done nothing but spill T? Charlie basically tried to infer that Shea has a big ego, which she never said to Shea’s face 🤷🏼‍♂️ but everyone wants to attack the black queens the minute they speak up about ANYTHING
Didn’t feel like typing the whole thing out but I’m happy to take that back if you’re offended!
If Charlie’s response was a joke it wasn’t funny lmfao. She was shady as hell in her Hey Qween interview, and to respond with “if you’re offended I can take it back” doesn’t seem like a joke lol
I’ve been using Tailor for a few years now, love it. It doesn’t always work but it works most of the time. 
☕️
*i think I misunderstood the assignment*
*i didn’t go to school for fuckin english*

Whoops lol, completely misread their comment
Omg it was an entire post and now it’s gone!! Account must’ve naive’d themselves. Lemme see if I can find it

Edit: nvm found it https://www.reddit.com/r/SpoiledDragRace/comments/7z942i/tomorrows_tea_today/?st=JDYQJTTG&sh=6ba4db59
Someone on here that has already seen the episode said that Ben and Kennedy both get decent critiques, with Kennedy getting slightly better critiques than Ben (but both are safe). Bebe sends Aja home. 
It’s Reachability, introduced with the iPhone 6 series. It brings the screen down so you can reach what’s on the top easier. 
“I know you may feel like it has nothing to do with my race. But there is an overwhelming amount of instances of fans always wanting to label black queens “angry” or “upset” Our white counterparts can shade us - no problem. We banter and throw shade back, and we are SILENCED”

From Shea’s twitter directly, and I agree with her. She was trying to make a joke with her initial tweet and then yeah she got kinda bitter when everyone wanted to immediately silence her. I’m with Shea on this one. 
Just an fyi, she goes by Cracker for short, not Miz
The stainless steel on my silver X shows a lot less scratches than I thought it would. Of course, I have kept it in a case most of the time so that’s probably why. The bottom is always exposed tho and it still has nearly zero scratches 
Apple is supposed to be replacing the 2017 iPad with an even cheaper $260 iPad within the next month or so, so I’d wait and see what comes out of that. 
Tbh, I lived for her Disastah outfit. I even liked her makeup even tho the judges read her for it. She looked fierce. It just didn’t fit the challenge that well, especially with those bullshit sidekicks
Not a single T spiller ever mentioned Bebe being a mole, it was just a fan theory. I never bought into it tbh
The thing about the “mole” theory is that the mole in the Handmaids Tale was such an insignificant part of the story that nobody would even get it unless they’ve read the book
The thing is, the people that said Trixie and Kennedy are top two have gotten so much stuff right. But I just looked at the T checker, one of the sources now says that Trixie and Kennedy got the most votes to be ELIMINATED. Wtf. 
The episodes didn’t leak, what had happened was that u/RealityTVLeaks had the episodes and was leaking clips, but never leaked the actual episodes. And the only clips they leaked were of episodes that were airing the day they leaked them. 
World Of Wonder don’t like her so I won’t at all be surprised if she goes home over some bullshit reason lol
T checker lmao. The rest of their T checks out too
Girl, this ain’t the spoiler sub
I say Blair, Vanessa, Dusty, Kalorie, and Mayhem were cast as filler. I know Mayhem is a fierce queen but she supposedly goes early in the competition so I think they cast her as a filler queen
I’m living for it but I’m slightly upset at it being at the expense of Shangela getting the crown because she deserves to win. I’d also like to see a black girl in the Hall of Fame
Idk lol, she’s doing the challenges well enough, she even said so herself that she doesn’t feel like she has anything to prove. I don’t think she cares about winning again. She just wants to show the fans who she is and what she has to offer. There’s T that she wins at least one challenge anyways. And tbh, I DO see them eliminating her since she isn’t in the top 2 lol
My favorite thing with how convinced y’all are about this mole theory is that it’s literally such an insignificant part of the Handmaids Tale that they’d never do it. The only twist regarding Bebe is that she’s even there in the first place 
Wait, did you really not know that was there until you bought the phone? That’s the cutout in the display to fit the earpiece and camera and Face ID sensors. 
I literally started screaming thinking about someone who has no idea what we’re talking about reading that comment 😂
The only accurate T you will find comes from the T checker. There’s two sources with 100% accurate T so far. Don’t check YouTube, they get all their info from here. 
Morgan was bitter, and decided to eliminate the queen that sent her home. None of the queens in season 9 had a hand in the eliminations. I think they would’ve voted fairly. 
Her competitors liked her, though. I think the eliminated season 9 queens would’ve voted fairly since they wouldn’t be bitter over any of the queens eliminating them since it isn’t All Stars.
I was just repeating what I saw on a post from yesterday, but we’ll find out in 4 days anyway!! Pretty sure Ben only wins 5 challenges, so I don’t think she’ll be in the top next week, but she will be episode 6 when she goes home
I’ve only read it on here, it’s not in the T checker tho. Supposedly next weeks top 2 is Trixie and Bebe. 
Exactly, Sasha still was in the top consistently throughout the entire season and never landed in the bottom 2
Exactly. As much as I love Kennedy I don’t think Trixie will get as much backlash if she wins so I’d prefer that outcome for Kennedy’s sake
I hope they choose lipsticks and the queens with the most lipsticks chosen get eliminated. The gag of seeing the queens eliminate Shangela and Bebe omg
With the T that she’s in the top next week too, I think she’ll be lip syncing twice!!
Could you guys imagine the gag of them bringing her back for All Stars? 😂
AHHHHH IDK HOW I WOULDVE HANDLED THAT
Auto call is not disabled by default. It came enabled out of the box on my X
I think their point is to reference season 9
Tbh, saying you hate any queen is most likely gonna get you downvoted. There’s no reason to hate people you don’t know personally. 
Someone spilled T saying the top 2 for next week is Trixie and Bebe, and Aja goes home. Not sure how true it is tho
Chi Chi doesn’t seem to care about being discreet about the T haha
Before AS3 started Shangela and Aja said we were getting 22 weeks straight of Drag Race. 8 weeks of AS3, and then 14 weeks of S10. Seems like we’re not getting a reunion for AS3, and if we are it’ll probably be in the finale episode. 
The source that leaked all the details about the queens jury and Morgan eliminating Dela (which was basically confirmed in the WOW lawsuit) says Kennedy and Trixie are the top 2
I’ll be the queen to Roxxxy Andrews my way to the top, guaranteed
I’ve noticed her brows are way too high up a lot of the time 
Trinity’s cop look was my fav, least fav is Derrick’s paper look
Kennedy and Trixie 
It did lmao. Promo started in late October with the cast Ruveal and the premiere wasn’t until 3 months later. AS3 is only 8 episodes
She doesn’t seem to care. She said so herself, she has nothing to prove. She just wants to show the younger viewers who she is and what she has to offer. 
Winning challenges being irrelevant will play well for me if I ever get on Drag Race 😂😂
Princess Disastah says hi. She might get overconfident in her sewing skills again and come up with something that lands her in the bottom
It sucks tbh, she’s been doing so well that I think she’d probably have to really bomb next weeks challenge to be sent home 
Aja is most likely the next queen to get eliminated
I’m kinda happy about it cuz now I can just go on this sub and find ALL the T (hopefully)
The S9 Tron promo pic was fanmade, Ru liked it so she reposted it lol
She wasn’t entirely wrong, Tabatha Coffey was still one of Morgan’s backup plans for Snatch Game. 
Just the angle and the way it was edited, we see her walking in this outfit with like a coat or cape in the teaser 
I really think this might surpass season 6’s promo theme. Ru’s look alone already slays it. 
Omfg I’m so shook
LITERALLY
It won’t be that bad, they’ll start filming S11 during S10 airing, and may even end up filming AS4 this summer too. If S11 starts airing in January/February then our off season will only be 6 months. We also have Drag Race Thailand coming with subtitles and then Dragula S3 so we’ll still get our jush sis. 
There’s a chance the finale is the reunion too. [if all the queens come back to vote on the top 2 they might as well do the reunion the same day](/spoiler)
My favorite part is that Phi Phi made up everything as she went along 😂😂😂
Yeah but it’s not the same style lol you guys know what I mean
Yeah but tbh I can’t consider them the same thing besides it having the same cohosts. The magic of UNHhhh was lost when they got rid of the editing
UNHhhh and The Trixie & Katya show aren’t the same thing 
You could’ve given a helpful answer instead lol
I love Chi Chi so much. Still my fav from season 8
[idk how that would make sense since Kennedy makes it to the top two anyways. Milk didn’t do anything lol](/spoiler)
Trixie and Katya’s first show!!! It’s on YouTube, there’s over 60 episodes 
I hope with this VH1 budget they can get someone else to do her wigs. Delta is dropping the ball tbh
The iPhone X in the pic has the wallpaper flipped upside down and zoomed 
I don’t always condone violence but these type of people really just need to get their ass beat one good time so they learn to keep their mouth shut lmfao 
We halfway through the competition you trick ass bitch Alaska didn’t have 4 wins by episode 4. They’re saying the trajectory of her run is similar to Alaska’s. 
Yeah that really pissed me off that they gave her a negative critique for her beautiful runway just for the sake of giving her negative critiques 
I love how you just displayed dislike for all the black queens. Qwhite interesting if you ask me
[Nope, she gets good critiques but she’s safe. I’m not watching live so idk what’s going on right now but the top 2 queens were the only ones that didn’t get critiqued](/spoiler)
They should’ve done Snatch Game episode 2 this season so that Thorgy could’ve helped it be a stronger Snatch Game bc overall it was pretty boring besides Shangela and Dela. Aja was pretty funny too. 
[Trixie ended up apologizing to Shangela and Shangela said she thinks it was genuine but still doesn’t know if she can trust her. Shangie even straight up tells Trixie during deliberation that she’s the only one of the bottom queens that she’s not sure would save her in a future challenge if she landed in the bottom](/spoiler)
I just watched the whole episode lmao bookmark me y’all 
Y’all be careful cuz this detailed af [Shangela and Dela top two, both win the lip sync. Kennedy, Trixie, and Chi Chi btm 3, they both choose Chi Chi. I just finished watching the episode, and the speech Shangela gives before she reveals who she chose makes it sound like she’s eliminating Trixie and you literally see Trixie prepare for her own elimination even tho she makes it](/spoiler)

Naivesmalls is quaking 
Omg that would actually be so sweet I need this to happen 
[cuz Morgan sends her ass packing episode 6](/spoiler)
Two double lip sync wins. She was the first. No other queens have had two lip syncs where both of them “won”
The Princess is in another league though, she always had the capabilities to make it far. I think a lot of the other early outs would still struggle. I’m not talking about actual stage performance, I mean competition performance. Two different things tbh. 
Drag kings and drag queens really are not the same thing. They’re going in 2 different directions and do not fit in with Drag Race at all. 
Nobody said LGBT community!! I’m talking about drag queens baby. I did not once exclude queer women from the LGBT community. As I said, everyone is welcome to share the drag community with us. This is a safe place for gay men and trans women. End of story. Bio queens need to stop trying to be oppressed. Let us have SOMETHING.
I didn’t say anything about being straight. I’m just saying that drag has always been a safe place for broke and ostracized gay boys and trans girls. They are the ones who created the community and they are who the community is for. Cis women need to stop inserting themselves everywhere in the name of equality. Everyone is welcome to share and experience this wonderful community with us, but there’s no need for cis women to try and force their way into our community. I’m prepared for the downvotes, but this is truly how I feel. ^i ^said ^i ^felt!!
Not even close. Stop reaching. Trans women literally created the drag community. They were the ones that jump started the LGBT community even being accepted in the US. Stop lol
Trans women basically created the drag community and jump started gay rights movements in America. Not comparable. They always deserve a spot right next to us. 
Right? I highkey expected [Amadiva](/spoiler) to be first out based on the supertrailer but was pleasantly surprised by her 3 in 1 look. 
This is the funniest comment I’ve seen in a while idk why anyone would downvote this 😂😂 how does nobody see that this is a joke?
THANK YOU
They mention Jenifer Lewis in the clip so I’m thinking Shang makes a last minute switch after seeing Ru’s reaction to her Miss Cleo
Omg I barely noticed that pic of Shangela 😂😂😂
Spoilers for anybody who wants to know:
Challenge winner: [Annee Maywong](/spoiler)
Btm 2: [Meannie Minaj and Morrigan](/spoiler)
Eliminated: [Meannie Minaj](/spoiler)
!redditsilver
Again, you’re proving my point. These girls have grown in terms of their drag, not their performance. These girls were all early outs so a lot of these challenges would be new to them. We would get a very lackluster season. 
I mean we say that, but look at Trixie on AS3. She has grown immensely since her season and still isn’t slaying. A lot of these girls grow in terms of aesthetics but their performance capabilities are still kinda lackluster, which would make for a shitty season. 
It’s the placements for tonight’s episode. Top row is the top queens, middle row is safe, bottom row is the bottom 3 queens
How would anyone deserve to be in the top over DeLa episode 2? I could’ve seen her and Trixie switching spots episode 3 with DeLa being high but safe, but episode 2 she had the hardest choreography, lyrics, and characterization to deal with and SLAYED 
[There was no top 3, it went from top 4 to top 2 just like S9. And the eliminated queens voted on the top 2 and they themselves robbed Shangela of a win cuz they were bitter](/spoiler)
RuRu left a comment with the actual placements tho, she didn’t just give us the picture. 
No lmfao, all she did was give us the original S9 premiere date before the switch from Logo to VH1 was made, so it ended up changing so she was “wrong”
[Kennedy makes it all the way to the end so she ain’t going nowhere](/spoiler)
Yeah but only bc she was given that fake T so they could find out who she was
I mean are we sure they’re even gonna give her the crown if she doesn’t win any challenges? If Kennedy wins another challenge she may very well take the crown
True, hopefully this will spark an incentive for WOW to do official Portuguese subtitles
All I’m saying is that these people getting outraged for WOW shutting down an illegal source makes no sense. WOW needs to make money. That is how we get more Drag Race. If they aren’t paying for the show then WOW has no reason to allow it to continue. 
I have a question, do these people give any money to WOW for the distribution of the program with Portuguese subtitles or do they just post them for free (AKA illegally)? I’m only asking because I literally don’t know. If this is just a fan that subtitles the show and posts it online, why are all these fans so mad? WOW isn’t even getting any money from it lmfao, why would they continue to allow their show to be distributed for free?
At first I thought I was gonna have trouble adjusting to no home button, but now I hate using the home button on my iPad lol. The gestures really are better once you get the hang of them
Before iOS 10 it used to group notifications by app, idk why they took that away and thought it was a good idea
It’s Bens dress lmfao 
Funny thing is all the T says she does go home the next episode 😂😂
I loved my old iPod Touch 
Yeah she was definitely getting ready for AS3 when that pic was taken lol
The ramen noodle wig was Peppermint’s lol
Mattered for season 9 lol
Apparently whoever was giving Naive info gave her that one wrong piece of T to find out who she was and that’s why she deleted her account 
Not really tbh, she basically runs the bookings at her home club so she’s always gonna be getting paid. She knows she’s not a fan favorite so she’s not at all afraid of the backlash which I low key live for even tho I don’t wanna see Dela go like that
Same tbh. Like I’m cool with Kennedy winning cuz I love her but the idea of the other queens robbing Shangela of a crown just cuz they’re bitter she eliminated them is so fucked up
I’m assuming she’ll be going at the Warhol Ball. Since Top 5 is supposed to be DeLa, and then Morgan takes her spot and then Morgan goes the following week, and then top 4 of Bebe, Trixie, Kennedy, and Shangela (which is the first top 4 that got leaked so I think it’s the real deal)
I really hope she takes the crown
I turned off attention awareness, so i never have to directly look at my device and it recognizes me at an angle, I’m fine with having to pick up my device to unlock it since I prefer to use it that way anyways. 
I very rarely get fails with Face ID tbh
Face ID has proven to be much more reliable than Touch ID for me tbh. I forget it’s even there most of the time. 
[I mean almost every single source has said Trixie makes it to the top 2 so she def doesn’t go home](/spoiler)
That’s an adverb baby

“I didn’t go to school for fuckin grammar”
They always are working on new software. iOS 12 is being rumored to be focused on performance and stability rather than introducing big new features. 
Pretty sure that’s season 10, the background is different from AS3. 
“Wondering if such an ungrateful queen deserves to be doing so well”

Let me stop you right there baby. Nothing she has ever said or done was ungrateful. It is a FACT that the producers treat the queens much worse than we are aware of. They play mind games with the queens to get what they want. It’s reality TV. Her speaking up about the truth isn’t being ungrateful lmfao. 
Same, I’ve never seen so much T and shade compiled into one spot
Fits in with the Wagon Wheel Watusi comment Ru made in Milk’s elimination message tho
So no twinks
So wait, is nobody noticing the new T that was just added about the top 2 being Trixie and Kennedy? It also says Trixie is the Roxxxy Andrews of the season and they got Milk going on episode 3 right. It says the top 4 twist is that the eliminated queens vote for the top 2 and Shangela eliminates the most queens so they don’t vote for her. 
It doesn’t have to be a queen, it might be one of the guest judges playing the game with them
I’m thinking Ben and Morgan are gonna lip sync and Morgan wins which gives her Bens place in the competition and Ben gets eliminated 
There’s 4 queens in the bottom row lmao look a little closer baby 
Omg please screenshot it 😂😂😂
In an 8 episode season that’s the halfway point lmao 
😂😂
Untucked should just be 45 minutes of in house shenanigans and backstage drama 
Not really tbh, the 6 is not much different from the 5S besides a larger screen and new design. The processor is only marginally better. 
There’s an 8th person in the top row lol. We aren’t talking about the shadow in the bottom row. There’s 4 people on the bottom and 4 people on the top. 
That’s in their imgur link. There’s two screenshots 
Lmfaoooo literally. Love Morgan for being so unapologetic in everything she does. 
LMFAOOO
THAT would be the ultimate gag in Drag Race history
Tbh, along with the T that [DeLa “eliminates herself” and another T spiller saying that she doesn’t actually eliminate herself but still isn’t top 4, I think what’ll happen is that Morgan will beat DeLa in a lip sync and take her spot in the competition, which would add up with the hints we’ve been getting](/spoiler)
Idk, we’re at the point where I can’t see any of these queens going home unless they really bomb Snatch Game. I see Chi Chi going next unfortunately. 
I very rarely saw anybody expect Aja to be an early out. We all knew she would make it at least till the 4th episode. 
Do you have the money to spend? Or will it be over your budget? If you can afford it go for the X, if you’re ok with a bigger phone get the 8 Plus. 
The 6s is still a powerful phone so if you’re not willing to spend the money you should just get your battery replaced. Or, go for the X. I went from the 6s Plus to the X and I’m loving it. 
Everybody not on Reddit. We never underestimated her, but literally everyone on social media was ragging on her when they announced the cast. 
Episode 5 is the Warhol Ball tho lol
Are you fucking kidding me? How does that resemble Oprah? 🤦🏼‍♂️
That was said, but the same source also said that DeLa still isn’t in the top 4.
Set your feed to show the newest posts, it was just posted on the sub
No clue, I read it on here when AS2 was airing so it’s been a minute 
Apparently she says it that way so that they can’t be sued for not actually giving the queens the money but that’s just some shit I read on here so it could be delulu fan fiction. However one of the AS2 queens that won a lip sync did say they never received the $10,000 so it could be true. I think it was Roxxxy. 
Def a bug, tapping where it’s supposed to be still brings up the audio source menu, even though the button doesn’t show
Chi Chi was in the bottom 3 that week. And her Patti Labelle was amazing, I wouldn’t had complained if she was in the top 🤷🏼‍♂️
Me too, I’ve always lucked out with my Apple products and I’ve never gotten one with issues 🤷🏼‍♂️ but I’m not worried if I do cuz I know Apple is good about manufacturing defects and they’ll replace it
Fav songs from that album would be Bad Kids, Electric Chapel, and Black Jesus + Amen Fashion. Only song I ever skip is Americano but sometimes I don’t skip it. 
I hope this is sarcasm lmfao
The episode went live on On Demand early and the eliminated queens reaction is sooooo cringey 😂😂😂
But Snatch Game is episode 4 lol that’s next week 
I saw the leaks and I’m shook 
I don’t think so, I think it’ll be episode 6. Episode 6 will be the top 5 episode so it makes sense to have the 5 eliminated queens return for that episode, making episode 7 top 5 again and episode 8 top 4/the finale. 
Next week
Omg this is giving me my life right now
[Milk](/spoiler)
Accept my follow request 😭😭 and the eliminated queen has already been revealed by SupermodelRuRu
Episode 8 is supposed to be the finale. So if episode 6 is the returning queens episode and we start episode 7 with a top 5 again, then episode 8 will be the top 4 finale. There will be a reunion too which will be episode 9. 
True, that was just the way I interpreted it with the critiques she was being given in the preview. 
Trixie gets declared safe at the last minute. Tbh I think they’re going to critique everybody this week and that’s why they end up having so many bottoms. 
Because she keeps interrupting her and Trixie can’t get any words in 
u/RealityTVLeaks do u have any t
Oh my god it took me way too long to realize everyone was being sarcastic on that sub
Lmao she may not leave LA much but she’s ALWAYS booked
I don’t even notice it there. I can understand why people wouldn’t like it but it doesn’t bother me
I’m not seeing a problem tbh
Lmfaoooo
Try enrolling in the public beta and seeing what the battery settings in 11.3 say
Michelle might have mashed potato brains just like Ru
It might be worth looking into the $0.99 per month 50 GB iCloud subscription and off-loading all of your pictures and unused files. 
Then go do that and come back with it for us 
Yeah lol, the beta 2 for public beta testers hasn’t been released yet, it’s usually the day after developer beta gets seeded
Are you on the public beta or the developer beta?
a better question is when did you last update?
If you’re picking between the standard size 8 and the iPhone 7 Plus, I’d go for the 7 Plus. The camera on the 7 Plus will be way better, and the battery life is insane. 
SCREAMING
Tbh I think she’s someone that knows Aja. All she had was t about S9 and AS3 and now she’s gone lol
Omfg you get to watch AS2 for the first time? You are soooo lucky
Ru never writes his music lol
I haven’t noticed the glass scratching but the stainless steel gets micro scratches pretty easily
Apple is looking into it, it’s probably a software bug. I haven’t experienced it but apparently enough people have experienced it for them to look into it. 
Listen to the people in the comments, just walk into an Apple Store and show them what happened and insist they replace your device. 
Omfg no I’ll laugh so hard 
It has inspired me to pursue my dreams and learn how to sing and do drag 
I still crack up whenever I see shitoris on this sub lmfaooo
Baby, Bebe gave us Diana Ross to a T. You can’t say you think Thorgy shouldn’t had gone home for accurately representing Stevie Nicks and say another queen (who did a way better job than Thorgy) should’ve gone home instead lol. 
Tbh the idea of Milk making it further than Chi Chi at this point is making me kinda mad. They really are just dragging Milk along for the hell of it and now she has to deal with the fans hating her for something that’s out of her control. 
Apparently the SE 2 doesn’t even exist. Apple supposedly doesn’t have the resources to develop a new SE, and if a new generation does exist it’ll be incredibly minor like just a new processor. 
They literally look nothing alike besides having bubbles on the outside lmfao
It’s especially worse when they mention it after I sucked the soul out of their dick. I live in New Hampshire, which is basically the south of the north, so all of my options are red necks and unfortunately most of them voted Republican 
As long as you’re like pre iOS 5 you might be able to just restore it. I’m not sure when activation lock was introduced. Might’ve been iOS 7 to be honest. 
It’s for BloodPops album 
....baby, do you just expect her to randomly come up with a miracle cure for fibromyalgia that doesn’t exist? It’s unpredictable and incredibly painful. Sit the fuck down lol. 
Yeah but then they could just use the shots where there isn’t commentary and just use the commentary audio 
Nah, they wanted Ginger gone. That’s why Alyssa won the lip sync lol (besides doing a good job)
It’s so fucked up honestly. Chi Chi deserved way better. The fans wanted to see her come back and slay, not be delegated as an early out. 
LMFAO
Can somebody help mobile fish out and tell me what the spoiler tags say. It’s ridiculous that we can’t access spoiler tags unless they’re in the comments section 
After seeing how they treated some of the queens already this season, I don’t think Nina would want to go back. I have a feeling they’d set her up to be an early out.
Scroll down a little bit sis this was already posted 
Except the 3rd episode is 90 minutes too. They’ll probably go to 60 minutes when there’s less queens
Yes it was a fun play on words but it was offensive and I’m fine with it being gone
Yay
It’s unfortunate how obvious the forced storylines are this season
I wanna ride your face 
You’re gonna burn in hell for that
Ew, Jesus. Gross. 
I’ll take any song from E•MO•TION at this point
I think it is a hair reveal runway because this is the episode where Milk pulls that ponytail out of her head or whatever it is that she’s doing 
To the left of the space above the 1, right? All the way at the edge? 
I agree, I liked Chi Chi’s original neon look more, too. She should’ve gone for something similar but still made it better 
You’re entitled to your wrong opinion 
They have the same username so I’m assuming so
So fucking shady lmao
Over time you’ll find Face ID becomes even more reliable the more it learns about your face. Face ID even works with half my face smooshed into my pillow when I get up in the morning. 
Tbh I like shady queens but Milk just comes off as annoying. Shangela is the definition of being a shady queen but still being likable 
Omg they even use the same banners too I love it
Yeah she should’ve done a finger wave wig, even if we see them a lot. It would’ve just looked better
Found Milk’s alt
Baby, I had my opinion on not buying what she’s saying — but I am never going to go out of my way to try and tear a queen down. That’s the t. 
Damn, yeah I don’t agree with hating on queens like that all. Like she can go next but it blows my mind that people actually have the energy to blatantly hate on a queen 
If anything Chi Chi has mostly handled critiques very well lol wdym
Send ha home. I’m not buying it. Imagine if Kennedy reacted that way. The fans would’ve torn her to shreds
And she already won 2 challenges
It aired after the meltdown but they filmed AS2 in 2015 
Bitch me too
Aw I’m so jealous. So hard to find a good top in New Hampshire 
I always ruin it for myself but it’s so exciting when shit leaks
I could definitely see her killing this challenge omg I’m so excited 
Holy fuck Trixie looks so good in that wig 
WHAT THE FUCK I THOUGHT THIS WAS GONNA BE FAKE LMFAOOO
LMAO 😂😂😂 you’re my favorite leaker already. Naivesmalls is quaking 
This is a post with spoilers about episode 2. Unrelated spoilers need to be tagged. With that said, they got rid of the spoiler so there’s no problem anymore lol
It doesn’t work anymore 
Idc about downvotes, my karma can handle it lol. Long as they got rid of the spoiler before too many people saw it I’m good 🤷🏼‍♂️
The tags say episode 2 spoilers, anything unrelated must be tagged
They edited it themselves after I called them out
[it said that they believe the rumor of Aja making top 4 more and more every day](/spoiler)
You need to spoiler tag everything. This is a post about runway looks. You just spoiled potential queen placements for people that didn’t wanna know 
Spoiler tag bitch. Just because this post has a spoiler tag doesn’t mean you’re free to post unrelated unmarked spoilers in the comments 

Edit: thank you for getting rid of it lol 
It’s not a sewing challenge lmao
I can’t, but it’s very easy for you to! Look at Apple’s website for the full retail price of their phones and then add the sales tax from your state
I’m assuming it’s probably a tearaway 
There is no 128 GB iPhone models for the newer ones. Only 64 and 256
Omg I saw that telenovela on TV a few months ago when my mom was watching it lmfaooo
I could’ve seen your point until I got to the “virus” part and realized you have no idea what you’re talking about lol
Alyssa definitely stole the show for this challenge. It’s only fitting that another House of Edwards queen wins it again 🌚
She’s a cunt lol
A lot of us have carpet floors lol my phone isn’t gonna break
I hate old cunts like Ann lol
It did run Android. With HTC Sense on top 
I’m just saying that your assumption that Trixie is changing for a lip sync and Aja is in the bottom is a reach lol. It quite literally looks like the beginning of an episode and they’re de-dragging from the previous challenge. 
Omg I didn’t even realize that until now
That sounds like a reach. It looks like they’re de-dragging from the prior episode. 
Kennedy lol
Season 1 costs $14.99 lol
Are u serious lol the Note 8 is huge 
It was in his pants so I’m glad she didn’t eat it
I’ve never had a white boot screen on my silver X. Was probably a bug tbh
*Milk, your talent can’t be velcro*
Lmfaoooo this is too funny
I mean Chad and Alaska literally confirmed it in the episode 1 skit, along with the message to Morgan at the end lol
This theory was realistic at first but tbh I think it’s bullshit 
You always wanna go to an Apple store about faulty Apple products. They’re the ones who are gonna be the most help 
Damn this bitch really came for blood this time around 
It’ll be fine, once the battery is full it stops accepting charge 
Are we the same person 
I’ve only used it once before :(
The Princess could get this shitoris 
Morgan is giving me Blanche Devereaux on meth
Can I sit on your face 
Omg
Ok I’m sorry I know the gay intern thing is a meme but this HAS to be a gay intern that posted this 
It’s turned off by default in beta 1, but there’s no toggle for it yet 
I would say probably season 5/AS2
My nipples tingle when they sense BS

They also tingle when I’m hungry, so there’s that
Adore was not out of key lmfao. Leave it to people who know nothing about music to try and judge music 
This sub has a hate boner for jailbreaking lol nobody is gonna help
People downvoting you but don’t realize that you’re right lol. They literally cannot replace the glass panel on the back so they give you a new device (most likely refurbished)
Yeah idk why people are seeing it in a negative way. She’s basically saying Courtney is smart enough to know what to expect going into it and she’s more than capable of outsmarting Ann. 
I keep rewatching Bebe’s performance. I’m so captivated watching her
I’m so shook at the idea of [Aja](/spoiler) in the top 4. I need it to happen 
She wasn’t the one who said that. She “confirmed” that a person who spilled that was telling the truth 
If you watched AS2 you hear the top 4 counting out their wins and Alaska says she won 4, Katya 3, and Detox 3. Katya didn’t win any lip syncs but they’re still considered challenge wins. The producers wouldn’t have included that in the episode if it wasn’t true. Aja even said that she’s considered the challenge winner along with Ben 
What if Bebe has to consult with Chad and Alaska to pick the winner? Maybe they’re giving all the power to the queens this season and that’s the crazy finale twist where Ru doesn’t pick the winner at all
People always say that there was Vaseline on the camera lenses lmaoo
Definitely Alyssa based on the wig and lips tbh
Smh at all the people downvoting this not realizing that you’re not being serious 
Foreshadowing that Bendela is gonna have a reverse Roxxxy edit. Miss Congeniality comes into the competition consistently in the top but gets portrayed as a cunt. Roxxxy has a better attitude but was consistently in the bottom 
But she did lol. Watch the top 4 episode again, the queens literally count out how many challenges they’ve won. Alaska said 4, Detox said 3, and Katya said 3. Why would they include that in the episode if it was false?
I still fucking love this word 
My face would crack if that happened 
She already lost 3 times if you count Naomi

4 times if you count Aja
[5 times if you count Aja on AS3](/spoiler)
Bitch don’t doubt pork chop. She is very respected in the pageant circuit and she’s a fierce queen. She just didn’t make it through the sewing challenge 
I wanna see her in the Hall of Fame. She can totally do it. Imagine seeing the first ever eliminated queen get crowned. They could end the series right there and I wouldn’t even be mad lol
Nah she literally said “what she would have done”
Imagine they bring all the queens back plus Ongina just for them all to lose again 
You don’t do African tribal dance in heels lmfao
Imagine having the wrong opinion 

*bloop*
Snatch Game would’ve been 9 contestants had Adore not quit in AS2. Episode 3 isn’t Snatch Game either so I guess episode 4 with 7 queens?
It was traditional African dance and she had me captivated the entire time 
chi chi or Morgan are the most likely. milk will be sticking around since they’ve shown her future runway looks in the trailers 
is it just me or does this season remind me more of the earlier seasons? i’m living for the drama already 
AS3 is definitely gonna be gaggy as fuck lol all we’ve seen is half an hour and i’m already gooped 
2:40 PM EST where I’m at now, AS3 premieres at 8 PM EST so 5 hours and 20 minutes left
So it’s called the All Star Variety Show instead of Talent Show this time
...well you’re using a different wallpaper lmfao
It’s the same (or mostly similar) setup to AS2 so we won’t be getting untucked, just the backstage deliberation during the show 
We can’t share streaming links lol
Me too hahaha
This is gonna be so useful omg
Image retention is possible 
I can’t breathe lmfaoooo this is the best one yet 
Omg and season 3 of All Stars starts airing tomorrow. Brb crying
I’m assuming the runway theme was bubbles? Since she has bubbles all over her bodysuit too
The size was an issue for me for about a week and now there’s no chance I’ll go back to a Plus sized device. I appreciate the size of the X a lot. 
😂😂😂😂
“You white gays” is not even CLOSE to being discriminatory. And this is coming from a white gay, honey. See what queer people of color go through before you cry “discrimination”. All she did was tell the truth, sis. 
So then you already answered your own question. If you prefer the 6s Plus get the 6s Plus. Don’t waste your money on the X if you already know you prefer the 6s Plus. I went from the 6s Plus to the X and I love it but get what you prefer. 
It’s just a bug. Happens once in a while
No. It showed her Episode 1 look plus 2 other runway looks
I also want the show to last longer. I don’t want them to use up all the good queens too soon. There’s so many queens that I want to see in the Drag Race Hall Of Fame. As much as I like getting 2 seasons in one year, I hope they limit All Stars to at least every 2 years. 
Yes, and Shangela was in the background before the premiere 😂 nowadays we would clock that instantly 
Really? My X has gotten way dimmer than my 6s Plus did lol
When it’s right it’s right. Might as well have an All Stars winner do the Pit Stop for AS3. By the way, she is so fucking polished that I wouldn’t be surprised if Ru ever asks her to take over as host of RPDR when she decides to retire. 
I’m honestly confused as to why they’d make a device without 3D Touch after they made the OS have 3D Touch gestures all over?
A few months ago my brain came up with some crazy idea that AS3 was gonna be the undoing of her career and it might actually happen 
Omg yes! I love when bitches can make themselves look mean just from their makeup. That’s what I strive to accomplish lol
Don’t worry about those rumors of the iPhone X getting “discontinued”. It’s being completely misconstrued. What they’re saying is that Apple will not be keeping around the current generation X when they introduce the next gen device(s) next year. I’ve had the X for a good 2 months now and I love this thing. It’s the perfect device (for me). I only use it for texting, Snapchat, twitter, Facebook, and music. The camera is also INSANE. The 8 Plus will give you a pretty similar experience! It has the same processor and amount of RAM, a slightly smaller battery but will offer better battery life due to the lower resolution display, and has almost the same exact camera setup on the back (only difference is that only one of the sensors has OIS vs the X having OIS on both)
I know, it feels like we can’t win honestly
I have not seen anybody direct any hate towards Trixie because of her race lol. Have you seen the absolutely horrid shit people say to Kennedy online? Please do NOT compare the two. 
I’m waiting for people to say “Trixie isn’t white she’s native” bitch she’s white passing and that’s enough to make the fans look at her in a more positive light
They definitely knew though lol. It was either on Instagram Live or at a show but Aja said that Trixie told her who all of the AS3 queens were before they left. They all talk to each other so I’m sure all of the RuGirls knew who was gonna be on
I’m honestly very afraid for how the fans are going to react to Kennedy this season. Nobody deserves the amount of hate she gets for very minor shit. Yet the white queens get loved for their bitchy comments. I really hope her sisters stick up for her. 
I don’t think anyone is mad at Milk’s success. Just her attitude towards it lol. This sub is always going to look for a queen to villanize. 
Yeah, the 15 minute preview proved to me that I appreciate Trixie and her humor a lot more outside of Drag Race
This is nothing like Trixie fans lol stop reaching 
No, that’s not what it means at all. Go to settings > general > keyboard > keyboards. Press edit and edit the order of the keyboards or remove the ones you don’t want 
No lmao. You literally have to go to the settings menu for the keyboard. Switching with the languages button is only temporary. 
You sound paranoid tbh
I mean are you surprised? I don’t even talk about race on this sub anymore cuz I already know the white American’s are gonna downvote me to hell lmao
I think it’s the fact that Milk came off very pretentious about jobs she got because of her good looks and connections, and Shangela was talking about what she had done with her career through incredibly hard work lol
Wasn’t shade lol
