Yeah, With My ROG 1070TI on automatic fan speed I never really go past 60C. He should definitely repaste! And that malfunctioning fan will help to work out. 
Yeah it's quite odd as it's a tripple fan and undervolted. After he cleans out the interior and replaces probably 3 year old Thermal paste it should be good! But yes, 70C is sort of hot for max fan speed, I know my computer sounds like a damn jet engine at 100% Gpu fan speed. 
He's saying it never goes past 70C when the FANS are running at 100%. He didn't say the load he's putting on it. If it's 100% load then that's perfectly fine!

Wow That's pretty awesome., I've been looking to talk to a scammer just as a joke and waste time, One just added me about a hour ago.

I love the Vector! I've won a couple 15+ kill games with it. Absolutely worth it and better than some assault rifles in certain cases, It just shreds.

Totally understandable, bullshit Fees and overdue books! I like your style. Not as bad as a friend I had, He used to take out like 150$ worth of books, Send yearly, There's a day when the library will remove your fees if you donate food to the charity they support, So he does that and clears his name and keeps the books. Shameful haha

Definitely. What of? Like the glass when it's not applied pressure or what? 
All the love for this sort of gave me inspiration to listen, I've never listened to a Pink Floyd song in my life, This past day I've been listening to *The dark side of the moon* and *The Wall* Wow is all I can say. *Money* Was just such an experience. *Breath (In The Air)* is a very soothing song, I've been continuously listening to it, It's completely blocking out my Tennitus, It's a very relaxing song. 
Looks very much matter. A massive dark rock pro 3 on a micro would look hilarious. Not to mention clearance. Anyways, Thank though. I'm going to need to get a am4 bracket aswell. 
From what I've seen. Look at all of the 1 egg reviews on Newegg. And on Amazon the top review is someone's crapping out in 6 months, Then another one in 1 month. It's just from what I've seen man. But that sounds enlightening 
Yeah I figure. Im pretty sure I have an extra USB header. I'll check tomorrow thanks for the comment. But the fans on the RAD connect to what? 
I'm running the mini. But from  what I'm reading the H100i uses no fan headers. Just need that confirmed

13? Wow, I'm glad you're doing well. Yeah I'm trying to just embrace it as everyone has said that's the best way to live along side it. Thank you
I was really considering it. I'm trying to manage it on my own for now.. But I'll be sure to get help if it gets any worse. 
Yeah, I hope that'd come true! My doctor told me I'll have to live with it, If it goes away, Then it goes away, If not, So be it. Thank you
That's what I've been thinking about investing in, I want to be mentally strong enough to not let it get to me anymore, trying to drown it out all day, Thanks ya. 
I'd hope so, Thanks. 
Yea, Luckily my favorite pass time is listening to music. Although seems even too silent at times if I'm not focusing on something else as well. Thank ya :) 
That's my main problem and maybe even one of the reasons it all started, (Stress and anxiety). I'm hoping I can get past all the negative and just learn to live along side it. Thank you 
Thank you.. For all this. It's alot to process, but im seeing how many of you are still doing well and all that, It gives me hope, To be happy and live along side this, Not against it. 
I've noticed how much white noise helps.. Or just any noise in general? I really need to focus on being more proactive, Or occupying my time throughout the day and as well as spare time, I spend most of the day alone, Making some friends seems like it'd be a good idea just to take my mind away, As sitting in silence isn't helping anything. Thanks for the advice. 
Yea.. Set to permissive, Still not working 
Checking :)
Yes, I've given it full root permission. Yeah? I've seen a lot about cSploit but when i was using the Simple sniff i can't find the saved Pcap file.

Yes! I'm realizing now that the 1600 is not much more expensive too! And if I'm not satisfied with Proformance I can order another stick of 8Gb ram

I'm still looking for the answer for that myself, Freind.

Of course, Bro
(Message to mods, Don't know if this goes against sourcing.. But whatever)  Here is the official page https://tails.boum.org/install/win/usb/index.en.html
Just do your research before doing anything. People being over-confident in their security is probably the main cause of being caught. 
Look into getting tails to run off a USB stick. It's very safe and wipes everything you've done after you're done. Worst comes to worst, Your door is being broken down, You can swallow that shit, smash it, Whip it out the window. 
Honestly, Anything you're doing is worth getting tails. Don't take the risk of using just a VPN. Protect yourself, bro.

Yeah, i really am. Anyways, good argument, sir. Have a good one.
Exept it costs money to do almost anything that makes good money. Executive, Motorbike gangs, Hiests. 
And again, I can go look at a thousand 2 month old games, Nothing comes close. PUBG has the 4th highest active player base. 
ill say it again, I have 1400 hours, I have the Platinum on ps4 and Ps3. I play every new dlc, the content is dying, its all just overpriced cars that no new player will ever afford without spending more money, and if all you're getting it for is the story.. which is a viable reason because of the lack of online content, id wait for a price drop and just play PUBG.. which OP is (good on ya bud)
Oh Ya? well the why is the average players on steam playing PUBG over 100k even hitting almost 200k
He has the money for 1 game, Between PUBG and Gta 5.. PUBG is just a better bang for your buck. Plus i see it dying everywhere I played on Ps3,Ps4,PC. Its not doing well on any. and from 50k-80k from how many copies were sold.. not so great. 82 Million sold, for refrence.
As soon as Red Dead 2 comes out, they will probably discontinue their already un-creative dlc. I doubt Gta can last any longer. (I'm not bashing the game.. i have 1400+ hours. and i see the decline in players, the rise of modders and lack of content.. like the game came out in 2013.)

Ohh, Haha alright cool. When I was in middle school that would have been cool. Good shit 
Good point, This is a huge problem in 1Vs1 aswell. I swear 80% of all Duel matches I go into, (Outside of comp) it's all people just wanting to trade, Then they leave, Very annoying. 
Do you actually use this? (If you're actually in middle-school that is, If you are, Be careful on reddit kid 😂) 
All good. Just because it took me 2 Tries on a fresh game. 4 times on ng+4 and like 15 on +13 (Not any harder than +7) so it's very different. 
Cool poll, But it's very.. Incorrect? Because the difference between killing him on Ng+1 vs +7. Just makes it hard for this to be a accurate scale of difficulty. 
This is beautiful ❤️
Yep, Well explained. 
Ah yes, Ok sorry. I thought you meant you'd have an easier time with Gundyr. My bad. But I'll just have to warn you, Even with levels.. It's all harder from here on out. *Praise the sun brother* 
Y
You can't level up or find any new gear until you beat Gundyr. 
Double whammy 
Well.. Yes. The best Noob class to start off as is knight. It's a tanky class with a basic long sword, Easy enough, Be patient in phase one, Hit a couple times then back off. , Phase two, Stay close and keep some stamina at all times. Goodluck, It only gets worse from here. 

*Praise the sun*

Thanks Mate, You're completely right. It's just safer for everyone, Until you know EXACTLY what you're doing or what you're saying, Don't post or go on the Darknet. 
Oh God. If you want to make a Page about the "Dark net", If it's just a info page, You're safer making it on the ClearNet, Just because the fact you sound like you have no Idea about.. Anything?

No. Why not support the game we all know and love? The tickets are dirt cheap, and definitely worth the pay.
# PAPA BLESS 
In game, activate the steam overlay and then look at the bottom right courner, you will find "recent players" or something similar,  or, outside of game click VIEW>PLAYERS to get the recent players list up. 

  

What? If you're on pc, Just look on steam for players met, Same with ps4. Idk about xbox
You can not teleport to other realms after your account is 48 hours old, Or have reached castle 8. But the game starts up 2 new realms every 2 weeks(roughly)

Aha yeah it's been very nice past couple days, So why not try some new shit, Good times. 
I've done close to a quarter of shrooms. Messed up, Lmao.  But thanks for all the insight my man. I might rethink it, But I'm confident I'll be ok. But actually, where I'm at it's been a very nice day! Canada finally getting some sun. So I may wait till tomorrow to do it, In the sunshine. 
Yeah alright, I'll just be in my house, chilling 
Thanks kid
Hell yeah 
I have the next 3 days off, I can be tripping the whole time. I just recently lost a good freind, Looking to not think about it, I'm glad to be fucked up 
Aha, Yeah if shit goes down I'll be sure to post.  Yeah well, Seller recommend 50 for an insane experience. He knows I'm not a small time user for drugs in the first place but hearing that, I'm hyped.

No shit eh bod, Thanks for the heads up. Never would have thought that shit would mess you up so badly. 
It really is a beautiful game. Up vote for those amazing screen-caps. Well done. 
I only have one question. How? 
Oi Fag, this is not a place for clearNet questions. I think you're lost. You also type like you're 5.

There is something wrong with you. Yes. But here you go, The only info I can find.. This was posted  "Nintendo players: we’ve not forgotten you! Expect an announcement on the next updates on Wii U and 3DS soon – today we’re only talking about PlayStation and Xbox, but rest assured there is good news coming imminently there. Not only will Wii U be fully caught up with the other console versions, but we’ll be confirming one of the most requested features is coming to 3DS. Thank you for your continued support, and we’ll be checking in on TCF to answer any questions."
Seems reasonable, doesn't it?

You're a good person. Thank you for letting the nest person who wants a Twix have an Mildly-intresting moment. 😁

Fuck that's ass. So what level are you? I'm only 200. But this shit is getting on my nerves. All my freinds who play aren't even near my New game so they get 1 hit by everything so I'm stuck to solo. Ugh, This Dlc is defenitly bringing back the OG difficulty. 
Yeah.. My character is pretty "Under-leveled" For +10, And I can't get one single summon. It's all unable to summon every time. I've gotten half way through second phase but keep dying.

Still nothing gets solved.  Always spam.  The game has no prevention for it.  
Well,  Im just getting into high quality audio stuff,  and these are the first "Expensive"  product I've bought,  They were 500$ CAD and I just want some feedback and your opinion,  and or suggestions. 
The Problem.  Wao provides nothing for spam.  No report button,  when you contact report they say nothing.  I This realm,  This one guy has spammed Wc for days and I no one can do anything about it.  Thoughts?
