Latest update, I get a crash every single time I swipe away an Android notification -- doesn't matter which app.

Anyone else experiencing this?
I immediately assumed Conway.
I fucking hate Trump, but come on now.

If France was invaded tomorrow, they would have the full force of our military behind them within the hour.
Oxygen is fine. This is bullshit fake news. 

The REAL deadly substance is dihydrogen monoxide. It can be EXTREMELY deadly and it's EVERYWHERE. 

Do your research. Don't just listen to your doctor. Google knows more!
Yes. Lots.
There are a ton of 3/22 orders that have had VINs for weeks and not a peep from Tesla. Definitely blowing past 12 day VIN to delivery average.
That's not true at all. Most of the viewers are not aware of that.

I know several people who have told me that Fox News was the only balanced news source and EVERYONE ELSE (you know, "mainstream media", "deep state", etc.) is biased and staging a coup.
Never seen this error, but I've always used the Tesla app. Was installed at the end of last year. 

Wonder if it's the connection to Tesla or the connection to the gateway for your inverters? You still have the little gateway thing on your network right?
91xx assigned yesterday. Got ya beat.
[Only five reports in 8 hours? Weak.](https://i.imgur.com/c1Uvlmo.png)
The latter.
Nope, just happened to check it. I just randomly look. In my defense, 2am isn't that late for me. I'm regularly doing work stuff until 4-5am.
I know I have a problem.
Just got a VIN in the middle of the night. At about 1:40AM EST. I checked maybe 20 minutes before that and it wasn't there.

White, aero. Tampa. Ordered 3/22.

91xx -- very (relatively speaking) early VIN. Wonder if it's re-issued?
That is a long ass sentence.
Please pass that first negative experience up the chain. It's important that executive has this feedback. Will make a better Tesla for all of us.
DataGrip is awesome but it's not free.
You guys that got invites think you are at the end.

What you don't realize is that this is just the beginning. The wait gets worse from here.

Good luck!
That's still a "visitor IP address" and it's still shady.

6.2kW he said it was a little cloudy. That's great for cloudy.

I've seen my system go from 15kW output to 2kW because of a few clouds before.

My point is the exact snapshot of how much power you're generating at a given point really doesn't tell you much at all about how much you'll have over time. Location, weather, time of year, etc. It all changes so dramatically.
If it's like the panels, they don't charge based on the number of them. They charge based on the energy they can guarantee will generated. This makes it in their best interest to stay as efficient as possible.

I'm not sure of the details of the roof, but this is how the panels work.
Good review but I twitched when he said the lack of the faux grille gave him pause.
Well there was a picture of the moon when you found him on the last level. So I just went into satellite mode and went over to the moon. You'll find the next level there.
Upvoted. 



After I put my order in, obviously.
I've been using it since last November.

Maybe this merge is for much older SC customers?
You laugh but you know that's going to happen. They'll extrapolate from the delivery numbers on SATURDAY (the last day of the quarter). I personally know three people who are picking up Model 3s on that day. That's not a coincidence.
Florida heat + 2x HVAC, 2x water heaters, pool pump, home office PC probably pulling half a kW all day. Shit adds up.

Sucks because it's going to get worse when I get my 3 next month.

It's almost 11pm. I have nothing running right now. Just office and a TV. Nest shows me both ACs are off right now. I'm still pulling 1.0kW. So bare minimum just to keep shit running I'm at 24kWh a day. 

[sigh](https://i.imgur.com/l7Zh0Bj.jpg)
Why Florida?? I've got 19kW and I'm still averaging 65% offset.
It's not insane, things just add up. I'm using about 70kWh a day now when it's a little cooler. I've kissed 200kWh once last year. 

[January had a few cold fronts. Running heat sucks.](https://i.imgur.com/e9BAbtP.png)
Saturday is the last day of the quarter. Trust me when I say they will do everything they possibly can to make sure you drive it off the lot on Saturday.
Do you mind giving some details here?
19kW checking in.
He definitely had a gun and you can clearly see the muzzle flash from a couple panic rounds that he return fires.

No, they don't. It will appear just below your Reservation number.
I configured like 10 seconds after I got the e-mail on Thursday (which was the same time my configurator went live, because I know I checked it like 5 minutes earlier and it wasn't there).

I went with White/Aero/EAP. I'm in the Tampa area. Hope we get VINs down in Florida soon too! Cheers.
Damn. Every time someone says "San Diego" a piece of me dies a little.

Anyway, congrats!
I went back and forth but settled on white and very happy about it. Seen white in person and it was beautiful.
Can't wait for someone to test if this includes the 10.4 AP changes. I can't see how it wouldn't.
Thanks for taking the time to do the video!

I can share the sadness for having heated seats being a useless feature in Florida most of the time. I was kind of hoping they would have cooled seats but alas.
Awesome. Thanks for responding.

I love hearing all the good ones. The negative experiences are so much louder, we need more of the positive ones. Cheers!
Anything similar on Android?
How do you like it? Any issues?
Disagree. Given the circumstances (the fucking turtle) literally vowing to obstruct as much as possible, I think he did phenomenal. 

He really only had the first 2 of his 8 years to reasonably make big changes and that's when he pushed the ACA. Even then he was forced to water it down because of GOP obstruction. 

Not saying he was the best President of all time. Just saying he was definitely better than "slightly above average". Economy was booming, unemployment was dropping, the rest of the world was beginning to warm up to us again after dubya, etc..

Then we fucked all that so here we are.
I had to pay $900 for mine (Tampa), but I thought it was reasonable with what was involved. They had to go from the main panel and then up through a tiny crawl space to a detached garage and then wire it down with nice metal pipes to install the outlet on a concrete wall.

I got quotes that were a lot higher than that.
Nothing-burger.
Weird, I got mine 3 hours ago and it was available immediately.

I got the email exactly when my configurator went live because I definitely checked it like 5 minutes before I got the email.
You too! Also got mine today!

Thanks for remembering me.
What time did I reserve or order?

I reserved at ~10:45AM in Tampa on March 31, 2016.

I got my email to invite at 4:45PM today.
Got mine about half an hour ago. The emails are now in-line (or even ahead of) the configurator going live. I checked my link 5 minutes before I got the email. After I got the email it was live instantly.
Just got my invite to configure! (Florida, line-waiter, non-owner). 

I never ordered something so fast.

We would say "dub dub dub" for www.
This has all been history in the making. How much do we know and talk about Watergate still today? That was like 40 or 50 years ago. 

What's going on now is much, much bigger than Watergate.

I like the Bolt and I'm always happy about competition. But man, it has a max speed of 90mph. I'm not saying I'm going that fast all the time or even most of the time, but there are several occasions where honestly that's just pretty close to the flow of traffic on some of the interstates I'm on.

Yeah that's gonna be a no for me dawg.
I'll answer #6 as an owner of Tesla panels and PWs:

When your PWs (and inverters if you're getting the panels) are installed, they have to get internet access to the main panel. They have a priority system in this order:

1. Ethernet
2. Powerline
3. WiFi
4. Cellular

Ethernet wasn't really an option for me and even powerline wouldn't have worked well because of how far away the closest outlet was. I was able to convince the installers to set up the Cellular connection because I didn't want it on my WiFi. They said they can't make that call themselves and told me to call the internal support line. I called them on the spot and sweet talked them into approving it.

To answer the original question: it depends. If you're on cellular it's going to be a lot more likely that you can still read the state in an outage. If you're on wifi then you'll still probably be alright because your modem and router should still be running off the PW. But if there is a wider outage and something with the ISP is out downstream, then you'll lose that connection. If the Internet is out (while you still have power) and your PW is connected with any of the first 3 options, then no-- you cannot look at the live feed in the app.
I just love the white.
Or, partner with Waymo.

I could dream. Imagine a Tesla with Waymo AP. Perfection.
Where do you see JavaScript?
It doesn't look anything like Java or PHP.

I didn't downvote you though, that's not nice.
That is completely reasonable in Go. In fact, it is recommended to be as short and terse as possible. 

Good rule is the closer the initialization is to where you use the variable, the shorter the name should be. One and two letter variable names are very common in Go.

Awesome. Appreciate your reply, thanks!
A little off topic, since your questions have been answered already\-\-

How sure are you about your 11am reservation? Do you have an indication of the exact time or is that a rough estimation?

Congrats on your invite!
Just use an incognito tab when you need to visit something without your active season.
Sounds like wishful thinking from someone who ordered online.
Middle of the year for the 35k is very optimistic. I'd say more like late 2018/early 2019 at best.
Every day? That's a little crazy don't you think?

I'll be checking every hour.
I'm also in FL and waited in line. \(Tampa\)

No invite yet.

I put my order in at exactly 10:59am.
Wow 170lbs in that amount of time is crazy! Nice!

Also geez, that username. Knew without looking you had to be on Reddit for a long ass time.
Did anyone in Tampa get an invite? I was about 50th in line and I don't have one yet. Still Mar-May.
Uh, they stopped selling Chromecast because it was causing confusion with their Fire TV sticks. Duh.

Was Dec/Feb an hour ago.
Now: Mar/May.

Feels bad.
It matters more and more. Waymo is light-years ahead and investors deserve to know why Tesla is so confident they can keep up with inferior sensor systems. 

They should ask this question every quarter. AP is behind and it feels like it's falling further behind.
Uh. That's important as shit for the bottom line here. That's a very good question.

They weren't. They were all actually pretty easy.
I like to upgrade every couple generations. Was just looking to dump my 6700K and move to the 8700K. Skipped the RAM upgrade last time so wanted it here.

Really wanted 3200 @ 14 for the RAM. Could have saved a few bucks for slower stuff, but it's just ridiculous honestly. This needs to end.

I don't think it's taking 13 months from order to delivery.

You might be the first person I've heard at this point who has a Oct-Dec date without an invite yet. Something might be wrong with your account.
The publisher is Tencent. That kind of gives that away.
It's completely reasonable for that to not be enough... at all. Some people just want to walk and hatch eggs and that's fine. They're keeping the game funded for you.
It's part of the enhanced autopilot package yes.
You probably don't want to hear it, but I imagine.. many months. It was key to get in before the online form opened later that day. That's where there will be a sizeable shift.
It's not the touching it's the water.
Sorry mate I don't. I just specifically remember the 90 number when we were trying to figure out how many sight unseen orders there were (in the US) in 2016.
Yeah I don't see them filling those orders in anything close to a month or two.

Though I think we could clarify, we are talking about all orders before the online reveal. Call them pre-reveal or sight unseen orders. The "line-waiters" are just the people at the front of that line. There was a massive surge when the reveal started and the online form was opened.
Last I heard (I don't have a source but I'll look when I get some time) - the average was 300-500 per store throughout the day (before the online reveal). Average that to 400. There were 90 stores in the US at the time.

Because of perjury, not a blowjob.
No car yet, sadly.

Two AC units, two water heaters, pool, etc. Adds up fast.

On a cool day where I don't have to run anything temperature wise, I can see 40-50kWh which is great. I average around 80-100kWh a day. The highest I've seen was when both heaters were running pretty much all day, it was over 200kWh.

I still have a week in January to go.
Cool update. Only 40% offset so far in January. So many cold days in Florida lately.

You can but 99% of people will keep the batteries charged completely and they are only used when the grid goes out. 

Electricity is sold back to the grid. They install a net meter. It counts up when you use more power than you're producing and it counts down when you are producing more power than you're using. You pay the difference at the end.

Completely depends on where. I started at 55k in Harrisburg. Then moved to Florida and pretty much doubled that immediately. Now I work for a California group (making California money) while still living in Florida completely remote. I can go anywhere I want.

Egregiously so.

Still the right play by them though, it saved a TD on that play.
Why pass there?

*Twice?*
Yeah you got me. I'm a Coke shill.
Coke Zero Sugar is actually so good. I was concerned after they replaced Coke Zero with it.  But it's legit.
Yep.
Absolutely. We can still get 1st seed with another win and a Patriots loss.
Why do the Texans defenders keep whining after every catch? Do they do this every game?
I'll give you three guesses.
Yeah that's fair. I can't say I've been to every airport in the world but LHR, HKG and AMS stick out to me as airports that I really liked. Tried remembering some good ones but honestly it's a lot easier to remember all the shitty airports in the world than it is to remember the good ones.
I love in Tampa and call it TPA.

So not quite "everyone".
I refuse to believe you've actually been to any other airports if you think Charlotte is better than ANY of them (let alone Tampa, widely regarded as one of the best in the country).
As someone that travels a lot, I kind of have to agree. I really love TPA. I also enjoy PIT and PDX.
Sucks they can't count my Tesla solar system and Powerwalls as ownership. I paid even more. :(

I got two of them and it took a 2 months.. just had it installed a couple months ago. I'm in Florida.

Although the guys did mention that they are hard to come by while they were here. I guess they sent a ton to PR.

And yeah, I'm pissed about it too.
Negative. The (physical) Wallet card could NEVER pull from anything other than your Wallet balance. I am 100% certain on this.

The best you could do is set up an auto-replenish on a time interval. I remember when that was added and I remember complaining that it wasn't enough. All the way up to the day they announced they're discontinuing the card.
> The Google Wallet card then acted like a debit card where the funds were provided from the linked credit card on file. Whenever you made a purchase, the merchant saw the money coming from Google, but Google funded the transaction by, behind the scenes, charging your credit card.


I wish you were right, but that was never the case. I was asking for Credit/Bank auto-funding for the longest time. But the Wallet Card was only ever able to draw money from your Wallet balance.

It was nice that it was instant to load.. but you still had to take out your phone, add funds, and then use the physical card. 

This limitation was one of the reasons it didn't really take off.
Yeah reddit is generally a lot more civilized than other forums.

It's weird. When we are out, I cheer for you guys because you represent our division.

But I get it I guess.
Looking forward is not the same thing as intentionally playing soft or throwing a game. Come on now. You know this.
When you say this you make us all look like whack jobs.
My man, stop giving so many away. It was generous enough, you deserve to get paid for your work.
Now that's something to bitch about. That sounds terrible. Hope you get that resolved and they give you something for it.

Edit: Serious answer-- it depends on the contract.
Just the opposite of what you said is what makes sense. Financially smart people make smart decisions based on math and reality. He did the math and determined that FSD was the smarter financial decision. Whether it was a $1,000 or a $100,000 savings is irrelevant.

The fact that you don't understand this would lead me to assume that it's you that needs to improve your financial situation.
He (Elon) said that it wasn't.
The outstanding votes heavily favor Jones.
Jefferson county is huge?
No one is lying. They have a model and based on live results, the results change and become more accurate. 

Jones probably got a huge boost because the turnout in Jefferson County is a lot higher than anticipated.
That's because the actual sub is the_donald. It's still as stupid as it's ever been.
Some people are stupid. Those fans exist on all sides.
How come man? Just curious. You seem to not really like us-- I'm not going to pretend to understand why.

But was it some game a long time ago? Some stupid unruly fan or something?

Anyway, you guys played a great game on Sunday! I always like watching the Dolphins play.
Please take him.
It really does. Now if we can win next week and lock #1, the remaining two games don't matter. That's 3 weeks of taking it easy on our starters before the divisional round. That's a big deal.
It means a lot for Pittsburgh, potentially. 

If we win next week we lock #1. That essentially means we can coast 3 weeks until the Divisional round. That's kind of a big deal.
Damn, NSFW warning next time. That was hard to look at.
I appreciate your optimism.
I wouldn't mind us resting for 3 weeks before the divisional round.

Get off our fucking receivers. You guys are literally hugging them in the endzone.
This is what we do man. It's been this way for years, not just the last five games.
A month?

Try like five years.
What???? He was hanging off of his fucking arm. How the fuck do you not call that?
I love the two or three random Bengals fans who jump and say "see!! Dirty!" in here every chance they get. 

The deflection is real. This has been a clean game. You don't have to get so upset that you have the dirtiest player in the league on your roster.
Steelers Ravens are just good tight games. 

Steelers Bengals is just a shit show. Fuck you Burfict. 

Don't @ me.
This is a normal feeling.
He is. He was also great in House, M.D.

Check it out.
This has been an enjoyable game of Bell vs Collins so far.
Pittsburgh.
Cheating? Oh please.

You sound like a crybaby. That's you.
Since when do our records ever matter when we play each other?

Is this your first year watching football?
They're saying Heeeeath.

It's a long story.
Hell yeah man! Good clean game. Best of luck.
Yeah I know. We've had four straight.

Done after this one though.

You're allowed to disagree.

I just thought "perfect" sense was a bit strong. Depends on which way you look at this.
No it doesn't.

I get wanting to keep the first cars near home. But to put a line-waiter behind a second day reservation is a pretty shitty thing.

No one knew what it was going to be in the end. A lot of people assumed it would go West Coast line-waiters first. Then the rest of the line-waiters.

Then it would move on to everyone else. That was a reasonable assumption.
Yes. This is news. If he really isn't an owner.

It's huge news, actually. So much so that I'm skeptical.
He was booped twice. Once to bridge the chasm and another that somehow completely flipped him around and changed his direction almost 90¬∞.

Mystery heroes. It's pretty fun to goof off in!
You're wasting your time arguing with idiots. It's pointless. You won't change anyone's mind. We are so far beyond logic and reasonable political discourse.

Just walk away.

Even if it was illegal (which seems arguable at least)-- it's still not deserving of a suspension. At worst, it was an illegal hit. Not a dirty hit. He was flagged for it which is the appropriate punishment. 

This is 100% the NFL trying to send a message about the game overall. JuJu was collateral damage.
Just a couple of ugly wins in a row that happened to get the spotlight on primetime. 

In fact, we have four night games in a row, ugh.

Thursday night. 

Sunday night. 

Monday night.

Sunday night. (Next week)


Wish these were spread out a little more.
Can confirm, he will be banned from our sub too. Ignore the children. We get them from you guys after every game too-- I brush them off. We know the majority of fans are respectful.
I have no issues downvoting a fellow Steelers fan. In fact, the faster these are downvoted the better. Makes us all look bad.
> Once they develop a CTE test that shows which active players are at current risk, it's a wrap

I'll save you the trouble.

Every position with the exception of kickers and punters are at "current risk."

There is no such thing as a safe hit to the head. Anyone who has been hit repeatedly (including simple stuff like LB blocking) will likely be showing signs. Just a matter of how much.
What? You actually don't understand the rule at all.
I would assume Mueller would immediately be reauthorized under Congressional authority.
Didn't we have one stolen from us right after that?

Officiating was bullshit on both sides. Recognize it.
Burfict took out Ben, Bell and Brown alone one year. Season-ending injuries. 

They never deserved sympathy. I don't want Burfict to get hurt, but fuck that guy.
Yep.
Yeah Burfict should have been removed from the league years ago.
> I hope he‚Äôs paralyzed.

What?
It was 100% PI. He held his arm for like 4 full strides. 

I have no idea what most of the thread was smoking after that call. That was blatant DPI.
4-8
9-2
No. That was a clean hit.

Injury fucking sucks but get out of here with that shit.
All these injuries but nothing dirty. 

This is like fucking karma being dished out for everyone at once.
This game is not representative of how we normally play. Our stats speak for themselves. We're not the worst good team at all. 

We still have the league leading rusher and receiver.

You can relax your pretty little self until our match in a couple weeks.
I'm shook and I'm sitting on the fucking couch.

I can't imagine being a teammate and friend and watching that.
Apologies if you are inconvenienced. Lots of people trying to grapple with the thought of possibly watching someone's last play of their career.
Rushed to hospital is last update we got.
It's random as fuck. Sometimes they throw it on zero and sometimes they give them a little buffer.

But that one should have probably been called. Oh well, you stopped it anyway.
I actually just feel ill. I can't enjoy this game right now.
Oh so that's how. Pretend nothing happened.
How the fuck can any of you fucking Bengals fan defend that asshole?
Yo, ChromeOS is amazing.

Yeah, the Pixelbook is super niche and crazy expensive. 

But don't knock ChromeOS.
I'll give it a try! Maybe some kind of bug or something. Will let you know.

Ugh.
It was introduced. It wasn't voted on or amended. It didn't make it to the Bill.
No, it was introduced. It wasn't voted on.
No. You sign in with a phone number, and then you link it to a Google account. That's it. You still need the phone number.
If it's the same as iMessage, then the email account is just another identifier. People can look you up and message you by your Gmail. But it's still tied to a number. 

I hope that I'm wrong though. I would love to just login with my Google account without my phone around.
Only cars sold in the US matter with the credit. And there was a substantial phase-out period built in that would have given full/partial credit for another year after the 200,000th sold. 

This is a big blow.
It's unaffected in the Senate version that just passed.

But now it has to go with reconciliation with the House bill. So honestly who knows at this point. No one who even voted on the bill actually knows what's in it yet.

Edit: It was introduced in the Senate bill but it was never voted on. It's still not in that version, despite what you might read.

Real sad state of affairs in government right now, either way.
If the designs were completely flipped around he'd say the same thing.

It's a strong Apple bias. Intentional or not.
Yeah good luck impeaching Gorsuch after this is all said and done.

We are stuck with that one for decades.
Look up the Saturday Night Massacre.

That's why.
All I care about is a true ChromeOS tablet or detachable. 

I would be so happy.
Uh.. Pittsburgh makes the playoffs regularly. They've been to 3 of the last 10 SBs. Just last year they lost in the AFCC to the Patriots. They also have more rings than any other team.

You are either trolling or you don't know anything about the NFL at all.
Yeah. That was the joke.
League leading rusher and receiver. 

Yeah no substance.
>  How can you be so far right-leaning and not like Tesla?

Because the left likes Tesla. It's really that simple. They have become the party of "opposite of what the other guys say/think."
Not Google's fault. Daily Tracking is Huawei software. Disable that stuff and just use Google Fit and you're good.
No HR is a deal breaker for me personally. If you don't care about that then this is an awesome deal.
Hey how are you liking the Control after a week or two? I'm curious, there are practically no reviews for it out there.
Oh fuck off, it wasn't a cheap shot and it wasn't dirty.

Doesn't fit the current narrative. Sorry.

Are you kidding me? All you guys do is bitch about it. It doesn't matter what the issue is or how few people are having it. You act as if Google is somehow getting a pass here. All I've seen is bitching and moaning.

Rhymes with Jerry Mandering.
Hey! I can answer what I can after having only used it briefly.


> like face id

Hated it. It worked fairly well, but it's slower than fingerprint and more than one time I had to move my head to unlock it because I wanted to check something while it was sitting on my desk.

> camera

Camera is awesome. Noticed the OIS wasn't as good as the Pixel (probably the EIS responsible). But honestly you can't go wrong any of these.

> display

Pretty much perfect. A little saturated for my taste but I'm annoyingly picky about it. Probably the best display I've ever seen on a phone.

> speakers

They got the job done.

> haptic engine

Honestly amazing. Apple is miles ahead of the competition with the haptic stuff. It felt really, really good.

> iPhone exclusive stuff like iMessage

I hate the idea of iMessage and intentionally avoided using it. I'm sure it works fine, but the less people using it the better.

> Can you compare the gestures vs Android's workflow for home, back, and multitasking?

I could, but I won't. It wouldn't be fair to Apple. I am way more comfortable in Android than I am iOS and so my impression is that Android's "flow" is a lot better. But I bet someone who was on iOS for a long time and tried Android for only two days would say the same thing about iOS.

> Also my most used apps are chrome

Chrome works fine. I pretty much require it because of all the stuff I have saved in passwords, etc. On iOS it's still kind of Safari underneath though, but that didn't bother me. What does bother me is that I can't change the default browser when I click on links. Google gets around it with their own apps (like if you click on a link in GMail, etc.), but otherwise, it's a crapshoot. Is this going to open up in Safari or Chrome? I wish I could make it always Chrome.

That being said. If you are not tied to Chrome, then you would be happy with Safari. It's a great browser.


> Reddit sync

I only tried Apollo to see what all the hype was about. It was good but too "airy" for my tastes. Does that make sense? Too much open space and I condensed things as much as possible. I think Reddit Sync/Relay, the two apps I also use on Android, are just better. Android in general has way better Reddit apps and I feel pretty confident in that.


> Instagram

Sorry, I don't use Instagram.

> Twitter

I use the official Twitter app on both Android and iOS and they both work great and are near identical.

> Spotify

I use Google Play Music, which worked great on iOS. I'm sure Spotify does too.

> calendar, inbox and photos

The Google version of these apps work better than the iOS counterparts. Use the Google ones. You want to use Google Photos instead of the iCloud crap anyway. That gives you the freedom to go back and forth if you want.
I was given a LG Watch at Google I/O 4 years ago when the platform kicked off. Since then I've had a Moto 360, Huawei Watch, and LG Watch Sport. The Sport was the best of the bunch but I'm not a fan of the bulk. 

I just tried the Gear Sport too-- I was instantly turned off when I needed to install 6 different Samsung services on my phone. I want Google Assistant on my watch. 

So I will hold out hope for improvements and a Pixel Watch.
I would be happy to answer some questions or start a thread.

My history:

iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, Motorola Atrix 4G, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Pixel XL, Pixel XL2 AND iPhone X.

I picked up an iPhone X mainly because I have been eyeing the Apple Watches for a while. I used it from Friday night until Sunday night nonstop.

I know that's only ~~three~~ two days, but I just couldn't do it. So many things felt like a huge step backwards. Notifications and stuff like volume control straight up drove me up the wall. I really really tried. The home screen grid of icons that you can't put where you want bothered me way way more than I expected it to.

Could I have gotten used to it if I gave it a couple months? Probably. But I would just be okay with it. I realize there's a comfort level factor here, but returning to the XL2 and Oreo was borderline orgasmic.

I will answer questions and I will be completely honest. I will be as objective as I can be, but it probably goes without saying, I just really dislike iOS.

edit: I will definitely miss wireless charging. That was one of my favorite features of the Nexus line and when they dropped it at the 6P I have been bitching about it since.
I say "Okay Google, Lumos!"
Looks like a Goldendoodle if you ask me. 
There are no ads on demonetized videos. Zero. 

This conspiracy bullshit about Google somehow purposely sabotaging iPhone videos is ridiculous. 
Citizen's won't pull it again. I think it's 3 or 6 month expiration. 
iUP?
My date is still "ships 12/01-12/08" via iUP.

But if I go through the process and buy another one the exact same way, it's "ships in 3-4 weeks". Makes me think 12/01 is going to move up further.
Carrier? Size? Color?
Mine updated. Nov-Jan to Dec-Feb.
Tesla will take them off and put them back on for only $500! That was important to us too, so we made sure of it. 

I think that's a one-time courtesy though. It probably cost a little bit more for subsequent removals. 
We are talking about iUP right?
12/12-19 via iUP still. 256 Black.
Sadly, yeah. üò•
You could do an essential load setup where you can pick exactly what you want to back up.

It wouldn't be a whole home backup but if you want to keep your car completely off of it, then that might be an option!
I didn't mean to laugh at you. The comment was naive enough that I got a chuckle out of it.

I appreciate the video but that's just not how these are setup. The great thing is that Tesla/SolarCity doesn't price your system by the number of panels. It's based on the amount of production that they can guarantee. So they have multiple engineers come out several times when they design the system so that every panel they put down is going to produce as much as possible. They won't mount anything on a mounting plane that's facing the wrong direction or that has shade.

And for the record, the panels are independent. 
Ugh, don't remind me. It's like $350/mo maintenance. But they do pest control and stuff too.

I appreciate the compliments üòÉ
Nope! Not sure with all the acquisition and such that you're talking about. But Tesla will work with Duke and TECO. They won't work with FPL right now because of their net-metering policies. 
I'll check that out, thanks for the tip!
Thanks üòÉ
Thank you, that's high praise!
Ugh sorry for the delays, but congrats on the system! Let's see some pics when it's all done. üòÉ
You could do an essential load setup where you only backup what you want. 
Tesla.
Florida. :)
There are an additional 14 panels in the front of the house (you can see a little bit of them in the right side of the picture).

Not sure what you mean setbacks for fire fighters. This system was designed by Tesla.
Less potent, certainly. But even on a really overcast day, you will still produce something.
No, lol.
Agreed. Love Google Photos. Also very easy to share and it's nice that it doesn't matter what platform you are on. Web/iOS/Android, it's all very nicely done.
Yes. And two water heaters. Which kind of sucks for consumption. Will probably get rid of those soon and get a single on-demand. 
Oh shit, really?

Thanks for the heads up..

Might switch to DTV Now anyway. Just need to figure out Sunday Ticket. 
Not trying to argue, just letting you know your SolarCity employee was incorrect. 

But yes, that's the way it would behave. Again, only if it was plugged in during a power outage.

If the power went out and you were charging your car at the time, you could just go unplug it or shut it off at the breaker. It wouldn't deplete instantly. 
There is no reason why it wouldn't. If the battery is going through the main panel and backing up the whole house, then all of your power (including your car charger), will pull from the batteries if the grid drops. The Powerwall doesn't "interact" directly with anything. It's a source of energy and it doesn't know what is drawing from it.
Yes, it pretty much would. More than half if you ask me.
That article was a bunch of FUD and I've gotten in plenty of arguments on reddit since then with people who think they know it all after reading it.

Edit: I went to find the article to reference here and I found a [snopes has been created since then](https://www.snopes.com/is-it-illegal-florida-power-home-solar-storm/). That would have been useful a month ago. 
Yes, that's everything. All the panels, installation, PWs, etc. It's competitive for the area.
Yes that's eerily similar!

And yes, you would drain the batteries very quickly if you were drawing from them to charge the car. Each PW holds about 13.5kWh. Not so much energy when you compare it to your 90kWh car.

You can draw about 5kW continuous from each one. So it wouldn't take long to drain them. I wouldn't charge your car from the Powerwalls unless you really had to.
It wasn't pretty. $75k or something said and done, before the federal credit.
Thanks :D!
Thanks! I'm sorry to hear about your power company. :(

I am with TECO (one of the big three in Florida). While they don't make it super easy, they at least don't have anything crazy like that. Tesla/SolarCity won't even work with FPL down here because of their backwards-ass net-metering rules.
Tampa Bay area!
Aye, but we do use a lot of power. I'm expecting about a 75-80% offset throughout the entire year. But we're working on trying to bring consumption down a little.

As for the batteries-- I originally didn't have any at all. Or the entire front array. I thought I could dip my toes with solar and had my installation and everything scheduled. It was scheduled for the day that Irma hit.. so it was understandably postponed. What followed was 5 miserable days of no power or water.

After that ordeal, I called to have the front panels added back in to the design and to add a battery so that I could use the system if the power went out like that again. My Tesla rep informed me I wasn't the only one to call and request that after Irma.. go figure.

But after engineering, I learned one PW wouldn't cut it. Not enough amps for some of the bigger stuff and I guess the system was big enough that I had to have at least two because of some rule. I'm happy with two because that can get me through the night no problem. I needed a couple soft-starts for my AC compressors, but otherwise it's smooth-sailing.
Hah, yep! My Tesla guy took a bunch of drone shots and he said this one (where you can see the PWs) was one of the best shots he's seen. You can see all three arrays (just a little bit of the one out front). Figured I'd have to share with my second family here.
100% that is your ISP throttling at prime time.

There is no incentive for YouTube to do that.
Your beef is with the form factor, not the OS.

There will be a proper ChromeOS tablet soon, I guarantee it. And it will run Android apps perfectly.

But I totally understand what you're saying about wanting a light portable tablet. I want one too.

It's not. It's an OS built on the Linux kernel with a Chrome face.

Android apps are also not emulated. The framework is containerized with direct access to the OS. Games and computationally intensive Android applications will often perform a lot better on a good Chromebook than the best phones out there. 

Not sure what your beef is. If you hate Chrome then I guess you hate Chrome, that's cool. But ChromeOS in my opinion is a clean, fast and secure OS. If I was able to easily run a full bash without crouton, I could almost get away with using it full-time as a software engineer.

I like ChromeOS more than Android. And I'm an Android fanboy. 
"Unlocked" has nothing to do with what's installed or not. If you bought it directly from the manufacturer you might be less likely to see carrier-specific system-installed apps, but that's it.

Unlocked means SIM unlocked. Manufacturers still make deals with companies like Facebook, Amezon, etc. to install software before phones even make it to the carriers.

It's like the CineBistro. I haven't gone to another movie theater in the last 5 years since I discovered it. The fact that you can't even go in there unless you're 21 made the watching movies an enjoyable experience for me again.

But I'm happy they are adding the option for people who want it.

Eventually the stupid noise will die down here. I can't completely blame you guys-- some media outlets are responsible for the ridiculous overblown headlines, too (looking at you, 9to5, Verge).
I love my Sport.

I think at $350 or whatever it was originally, it was a tough sell. 

But you can get one for $230ish pretty easily now on Amazon. If you're ok with the size of it, that's a no-brainer.

I'd buy one right now if I could afford it.

Yeah, that's no joke. I love my Tesla system but it came to about $77k (before credit).

Hoping it comes down for the masses sooner than later. 
You misunderstand. I love my 2XL. 
Holy shit the mental gymnastics that some of you are doing right now is mind-blowing.

I dare you to find a positive comment about him on our sub.

We don't like dirty players and Mitchell has had plenty of chances. No one wants him on the field.

If you go into r/bengals you'd see the opposite about Burfict.
> Am I really the only one that thinks that, in this instance, Burfict was a bit justified

Let me stop you right there.

Yeah, you are.
I missed the punchline.
Mike Mitchell plays like a fucking idiot sometimes and no one likes him. Not really going to argue with you there.

Harrison is not a dirty player. He had some incidents years ago but today he is a positive and clean player.

Shazier? That doesn't even deserve a response.
And Mitchell is unanimously despised by the fanbase. Finding a single positive comment about him in r/steelers would prove to be a serious challenge.

We fucking hate dirty plays. No one wants to see anyone get hurt.
Yeah but look at the difference in fanbases. Go to r/steelers when Mitchell does something stupid.

It's unanimously: "Fuck Mike Mitchell. Get rid of that asshole!"

Now to go r/bengals after a Burfict incident. You will only find people defending him. Anyone with balls to say "hey maybe Burfict isn't a saint" will get downvoted by the echo-chamber.

I guess I got lucky the first go round. 
Will try. ü§û
Well, fuck.
I'd RMA. My 2 XL looks wonderful the whole way through.
Yeah that article was a bunch of garbage.

The gateways are required because (IF) you are also tied to the grid, then you need something to immediately shut off power so you don't back-feed the lines. You also need a place to store the power you will inevitably overproduce during the day. The inverters are allowed to operate just fine without grid power. 

Without the batteries it's an accurate statement that you can't use your system when the power is off. But that's just as much of a technical limitation as it is a policy one right now.

Source: I am a TECO customer living just outside of Tampa. I have a 19kW system with two Powerwalls, all installed by Tesla. I went through the several months of song and dance with the county and power company for permits, etc.

In a power outage, I can turn off a few things and pretty much run my essentials indefinitely.
You're allowed to run power without the grid in Florida. You just need the batteries with gateways to be allowed. 
I tested with obnoxious Taylor Swift songs that I knew would be there. 
I loooove mine. No screen issues and it feels somehow even insanely faster than my Pixel XL. It updated 25 apps in like 30 seconds. It was silly. 

And yes, the haptic engine feels wonderful.
I tried everything. GPM from other phones and laptops. Pandora same. Tried from an Echo speaker too.

Nada.
Mine doesn't look like that at all. 
Yep. I've been turning on sRGB since I could. For funsies I went to check what it was like without it and I couldn't stand the oversaturated vomit. The reds especially look almost childish. 
Damn. Can't get this working. 
Reddit for 6 years, about 1000 comments.

My "worst" post is a -6 comment when I said "good game" in a KC Chiefs thread after the Steelers won.

I don't know how to feel about that. 
Yep, I put fresh reapers in my chili all the time. I actually prefer the flavor of them over the bhuts but to each their own. 
Ok, good. It wasn't just me. I didn't see the option. I assumed the site was fucked up.
Great, thanks!

My ship date is actually today, but it hasn't moved yet. 
You're in the same boat as all the other pandas. My wife and I ordered at the same time. My black one ships today and her panda won't be here until the end of November.
Is that regular shipping? Bummed I didn't get expedited like I usually do, but the site was crawling so I just pushed it through. I'm in Tampa so I'm just hoping I get it before the weekend so I don't have to wait until Monday. 
sRGB by default is a good thing in my book. If you really like the oversaturation, there's a vivid color mode now.
/u/opfeels /u/plexicle
And so much better. It's the first thing I do when I boot up a new phone.

I hate the over-saturated colors. Especially the reds.
Early reports are that the screens are different and it doesn't have any of the issues that the ones in the V30 have.

And I consider less saturated colors a win for me. First thing I do in a new phone is turn on sRGB mode. :)
lol no it's not.
Didn't you lose to us twice? So that would be 3 losses right? He said 17-3 vs "the rest of the NFL." That would imply we're not counting Pittsburgh games. 
Alright? GG
How wouldn't we? We played great. I don't understand your question.
Good game y'all.
Nasty but clean hit. 
Are you really saying we are "sucking ass" this game?
Kind of an idiotic statement. 
My wife says thanks, lol.

We said the same thing about Go before AlphaGo whooped on the world's best players and introduced strategies that have since become mainstays. 
The Pixel C was supposed to be a Chromebook. They swapped it to Android at the last second. That is why it's missing some of those hardware features you'd expect.
gg Jags you look good.
Caring about power rankings is stupid alone, so I won't go there.

But also, this is just the Steelers way man. We don't blow teams out. We handily beat (or lose to) the elite teams and we skate by (or lose to) everyone else. It's been like this for years.

I don't like it either, I feel like it's a lack of preparation, but it is what it is. A W is a W.
Are you lost?
Todd Haley is really pissing me off lately. This is not how the best offensive talent should be playing. 
We have the same system. 19kW with 2x PWs.
Yep. It was just as negative and it ended up being the best phone of the year.

I can't wait to get my 2 XL.
Well, the Googler I tweeted at that all the articles picked up for this said that they are [investing in that storefront](https://twitter.com/hoitab/status/915899151388422149). So there is at least some official presence there.
Dang.. nothing here yet.. but I'll hold out hope.

Sure, I totally get that.

What you meant to say was:

and not:

This is why your comment was poorly received. Not because you like Macs more.
Ubuntu (via the subsystem) on Windows 10 works great. Even for stuff like running Redis during development. 
Yeah that's just not true. He had control. He took 3-4 large steps. He made a full turn. He tucked the ball.

That was 100% a catch. 
Obviously that's what they think.

The problem is that 4 large steps, a full turn and tuck of the ball is not enough for them to consider it caught. 

Which is fucking ridiculous. 
Wow. Speechless.

Alligators are mostly harmless. They can be territorial but I'll see them hanging out here all the time. The only people/animals who usually get hurt or killed by gators are children and pets because they are kinda dumb.

We were still technically the offense on that play. 

So pretend that Ben fumbled the ball in his own endzone and then another Steelers batted it out. That would be a safety. It doesn't matter who fumbled it, it matters that it was a hot ball in our endzone and we batted it out. 

That should have been a safety.
"My favorite popsicle flavor is dick!" Actually got me.
On a serious note, it is. Go(lang) is an awesome language and I highly suggest to any engineer to play with it in some free time. I've been writing Go mostly fulltime for years now.

I graduated from SFU and I've never met anyone "from" Loretto.
As an SFU grad I never would have expected to see Loretto mentioned anywhere near the front page!
FCI Loretto? Never thought in a million years I'd see Loretto mentioned on Reddit. 
Neither have it.

I don't know, dude. Take your time.
FPL isn't blocking solar, but after just talking to my Tesla rep, he said they don't work with them because their "net-metering prices and policies are random". Whatever that means.

In any case, I was talking about Florida in general here. There is nothing FPL (or any electric company) can do to prevent you from getting a solar system with a battery. It's also still legal.
TECO.
Yeah that's fair.
No. You just don't understand the article.

> "Renewable generator systems connected to the grid without batteries are not a standby power source during an FPL outage," the company's solar-connection rules state.

Key words *without batteries*. It has nothing to do with the cut-off. You need a source to store the power to feed your house. You can't do it with panels alone-- it's the entire point of the Powerwalls. It is 100% legal.

Scroll down a few top-level comments in the thread you linked me to get to people who know what they're talking about. You're not going to tell me my setup is illegal when you don't know what you're saying.
The article is misleading. I have a 20kW system with two Powerwalls installed by Tesla only a couple months ago. In Tampa. I ran everything fine during my ~5 day power outage last week.
Easily. But I have a large 20kW system, so YMMV.
You are absolutely allowed to run your panels during an outage with a cut-off (like the backup gateway included with a Powerwall) in Florida. 
I have a Tesla system with two Powerwalls. They include an inverter and a "backup gateway".

The gateway shuts off access to the grid in the case of an outage and switches to the battery. The panels charge the battery. So as long as you have a battery, you can run (part) of your house just fine in an outage. 

Without the battery, how would that even work? I mean let's even forget about the net-metering and the danger of back-feeding the line (which isn't allowed anywhere by the way, not just Florida). You only have 8-10 production solar hours on a good day. The metering is there so that the plant essentially acts like a battery for you. It's a good thing because most people are going to over-produce during those hours anyway. 

I am in Tampa with TECO. My outage lasted about 5 days. My solar system is miles better (albeit significantly more expensive) than any generator. 
Yep. I think 53k after the credit. ~19kW, ~22kWh, 58 panels. 70-something offset. 
Total system cost was just over $76k. So about 15%.
No where close to double for me. My system was $64k for panels and $12k for two Powerwalls + install. Worth every penny. 
I paid about $12,000 for two Powerwalls. It's not that much more.
Yeah I know. I played the beta though.

Game thread was super clean. A lot different than the Browns one last week.

Thanks, gg mate. 
Are you guys blaming Pete for having too many guys on the line? Wow. 
No excuse for illegal formations here. 
Great on PC. Okay on console.
I laughed. 
God that sounds so whiney. Your defense didn't do anything. Bitch about them when you get scored on, not the refs. 
Yeah that's what happens when you tackle someone before the ball gets there. 
Okay.
That first month or two after the takeover absolutely sucked. (I'm in Tampa area).

But since then, it's been fine. At least for me-- YMMV.

edit: I only use their Internet. I need my DirecTV for TV (Sunday Ticket pls).
Also TBS.
Nope.
The chance of a headphone jack is nearly zero, sorry. 
Well the outage map just plummeted to 50k without power and my estimate went from the 14th to the 17th. Cool.
I only report people for toxic chat and comms and I also got the email. 
Now the text update is telling me 9/14.
Gas all over the place where I am. 
Appreciate it, but was looking for one locally. Thanks!
Could be worse. You could be me with a well. No power to well pump means no water period. 
Aye. TECO here too. üò•
Sucks for me that I'm in one of TECO's less populated zones. We are all on wells out here so without power, we have no water as well.
Don't jinx me. It's been over 24 hours since mine has been out in Tampa. 
Plenty enough time for a completion. 
That was a shitty hit but the rest of your comment is complete bullshit. 
You okay mate?
More like a late hug, but sure. 
You think defenders should be able to hold receivers arms???
Holy fuck that dropped fast.

It's a big circlejerk on here and it's easy to hate on Florida. But honestly, I love it here. I moved from Pennsylvania to the Tampa area about 7 years ago and it's been one of the best decisions ever. The people are amazing, the weather is great, people know how to drive, etc. Yeah, hurricanes suck, but so did scraping ice off my car every morning for 5 months out of the year. 

Florida is a beautiful state. The negative news will always be louder. That's just life. 
Well for what it's worth, I was telling someone an hour before I was talking to you that it could completely go in the opposite direction too. That was my only point, that things can change so easily.

But we're in this together, so I hope you stay safe.
I know. I've been waiting for your [fourth reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/6y7gaa/irma_is_now_a_category_5/dmolahp/?context=10000).

In either case, stay safe.
It's really hard to predict intensity. Cuba will probably hurt it a little bit, but it's still a massive storm, it's still in bath water, and these models show it hitting a relatively flat part of Cuba. I wouldn't anticipate that much weakening.

But again, intensity is notoriously difficult to predict. A lot more complex than the track.
The NE side of the storm is the strongest. In the last track, that would be Orlando, so yes.
Euro 12z init.
It's an older model and not very accurate.
Who the fuck laughed at Houston? No one.

If you're laughing at us for Irma you're a pretty fucked up individual. 
And Florida is also a pancake.
I don't know why you feel like that, but that's not going to happen.
Oh well that's okay then.
I know. That's why I said fun.
The other models are fun. NAVGEM is still a Tampa nightmare.
After a EWRC, the system often intensifies. Nothing really stopping Irma from doing just that tonight.
Can I see your 72-96 @6hr?
Perfect, thanks!
I'm looking at 072? It's still well off the coast. Are you ahead?
I mean /u/Ryan05055's 6-hour resolution data.
Where?
Can I ask where you get this data from? <3
[Euro 00z through 048.](https://imgur.com/a/zybG9)
GFS at midnight. Euro at 2.
Don't feel bad. It's a beautiful system. It doesn't mean you have to be happy about it hurting anyone.
It will go through several replacement cycles.
It's one model and we are a ways out. But if it's this size and 902 when it makes landfall, it will be devastating. Nothing like that before.
[GFS 18z through 138.](https://imgur.com/a/QDR8W)
If the lastest models are true, Tampa will be fine.

But we are 4 days out. SO MUCH can change. Stay vigilant. Plan for the worst hope for the best. Hide from wind, run from water. Etc. etc.
[18z through 120.](https://imgur.com/a/EpWIR)

Yeah, that's landfall at 902.

Yes.
Someone will. Close the tab if you have it open!
That's not a direct hit.
Probably. But we are still 4+ days out. Lots can change.
> Some of the dynamical models have shifted northward a bit from the previous cycle, with the normally reliable GFS looking like a northeast outlier. The official track forecast leans toward the ECMWF solution.

NHC still agreeing with Euro.
It's a double-edged sword, but there's not a good solution.
If "cold waters" = SC/NC, then yes.
[18z GFS.](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/FrayedAllDiamondbackrattlesnake-size_restricted.gif)
This is bizarre, watching our top two models diverge as we get closer. One thing is certain at this point, one of them is going to be very wrong.
Yeah, it has been. Euro is on a roll lately.

NHC agrees more with the Euro, looks like.
Aye.
Hypothetically? 185mph would level it. 
Looks like they are definitely accounting for elevation. I'm glad we agree then.
[Euro up to 192.](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT9IgBUeABJVvXJBWU/giphy.gif)
Which isn't unheard of when we're 120+ hours out.

Either way, the elevation is one the most basic variables that I guarantee you any half-decent model is using in it's calculations.
Really? You think the best models we have don't take the elevation of the land into account?

Come on now.
Too far out to say.

I can say that Euro has been performing better this year.
That's not how this works.
GFS: "This won't be so bad Florida. Might even miss you completely."

Euro: "Fuck you Tampa."
Wow, Euro is really diverging from GFS. That's way South/West.
Well, no, because the model is running now, so the only way to see it is here until it's done. Which sometimes takes upwards of an hour. At that point, we make the gif. If you want to wait, don't click on the link.
What?
12z Euro init: https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=watl&pkg=z500_mslp&runtime=2017090512&fh=0
Should kick off in 30-40 minutes or so.
Still sub-900. So bonkers.
It's 5 days away, it's nearly certain at this point it's going to hit Florida, it's just a matter of exactly where.

I've been tracking storms for a long time. It's already the biggest storm in the last 10 years and it's still growing. Our most reliable models are all showing sub-900mb at landfall. This is the worst thing I've ever seen.

I'm not saying panic and leave. But if you have the means to leave early, it is absolutely something you should consider. "Stay now for sure" is about the worst advice you can give. It doesn't matter how long you lived here.
This is piss advice. This complacency kills people.
There is plenty of time for it to move in either direction.
Anything is possible this far out. Plan for the worst, just the same.
168 confirms this is the worst run for Hillsborough, Pinellas, etc.
Well, Tampa, it's been a good run.
https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=us&pkg=z500_mslp&runtime=2017090500&fh=120&xpos=0&ypos=0
Woah, that's way West.
Still waiting on 120 but it's looking a lot like the last GFS run.
Euro 096 shifting West in agreement with GFS. Feel like this is kind of sealing the deal.
https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=us&pkg=z500_mslp&runtime=2017090500&fh=72
Florida being a pancake doesn't help anything.
As someone in Tampa, 00z 138 made my heart sink.
This run is definitely further South, so yes.
GFS 00z definitely more South now at 102.
It looks completely lined up with the 18z run at 054 still.

00z @072 still lined up with 18z @078. No changes yet.
The NHC cone is 5 days out. The curve happens pretty much right after that. You'll start to see it curve tomorrow.
http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/synoptic/time.html
The 00z (9/5 first hour) GFS run. The little squares on the right signify the forecast hour on the model. So 024 means 24 hours from now, etc. As the model runs (it takes a while as it's computationally extensive), you will see those squares start to be clickable.

US landfall in the 18z run (6 hours ago) was at 138. So in the current run, we (assuming you are in Florida) are interested in what the model has the system doing at around the ~120 hour and beyond.
GFS 00z now running: https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=us&pkg=z500_mslp&runtime=2017090500&fh=0&xpos=0&ypos=0
Aye.
Getting less likely every hour. 
We're still a bit out. Should know a lot more by Wednesday. 

But if it plays out how the 18z GFS just did? Then not a chance. Miami will be flooded long past Tuesday. 
If concerned means paying attention to it and having a plan in place, then yes, absolutely.
The storm will be no where near Orlando this Thursday. It's going to likely make landfall in Miami around Sunday. You're fine.

This is not true at all. Most evidence is circumstantial. The only real form of direct evidence is eyewitness or video footage. All other forms of evidence is circumstantial. 
Even DNA is circumstantial.

99% of trials that convict are done with circumstantial evidence. There is rarely direct evidence. It would be insane if you couldn't convict with it. Make sure no one sees you kill someone and you're good to go.

And in terms of being YouTube producers, which is what Ethan and Hila do, Grimmmz loses. What's your point?

I wasn't comparing Twitch views. I was comparing the size of their respective following. Twitch followers vs YouTube subscribers is a good a metric as any. They are both buttons you can click on either channel and be notified of activity.

I'm not sure what your point is but I'm not ignoring half of anything.

Being an aunt or uncle doesn't even mean you have to be older than your niece or nephew. You just have to have a sibling that had a child before you (the aunt/uncle) were born.

Say you have an older brother. He's 18 years old. He just had a baby girl and then your parents had you the next year. 

You are now one year younger than your niece.

As someone who regularly visits both subs and owns Android and Apple devices-- this is 100% accurate.

People praise Apple ALL the time over there for things they are doing right. I rarely, if ever, see it here. And there's plenty to praise Google/Android about lately.
The comment was deleted and I'm fiercely curious. What was this about?
So is the $2,500 due up front go in as part of the money down? Looking at this guys $5,000 down, the math only works out if that $2,500 due immediately was half of his money down.

No one said that. I have no idea where you are getting that from. The only thing u/liehon said was that you could tweet at them about why TSR has a booth and seems to get a pass. We can't answer that for you. Use your "logic to deduce a conclusion" here.
> This rule is absolute rubbish.

Again, I agree. Most of the mod team agrees. But it's not our rule, it's theirs. Your anger is misplaced.
> If i was a mod id inquire with Niantic because i care about this community and keeping it happy by giving it accurate information. 

We did. They said they're against the TOS. I personally disagree with that assessment, but it's their rules, not ours.

> What you're saying is you have no idea if its authorized or not but you also don't care enough about this community to get your facts straight. 

u/liehon is not saying that. Not sure how you extrapolated that.

> Instead I should do the mod work for you.

You wouldn't last a day.
Mate, the rule isn't that complicated. If you are posting a screenshot (like this one), post it as a text post. That's it. That's the entire rule.

It's a very simple rule, and it's unrelated to the tag/flair.

If you want to post a screenshot (that's not an AR shot), you must do so as a text post.

You can just reply to the bot with the flair you want, just like the message says. You can also add it in the title "[Idea] I am a title!" like so.

If you have further questions, you can message the mods.
There are people who medically can't receive the vaccinations (usually immuno-compromised systems). They rely on OTHER PEOPLE being vaccinated to remain protected against these diseases.

This is called [herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity).
They are different subreddits serving completely different purposes. /r/pokemongo is more of a general purpose sub. It sounds like TSR is the one you appreciate more, and that's totally cool.

It doesn't make the entire subreddit "BS".
How can I help make it more fun and engaging? Do you have any specific complaints? I'm all ears. 
It's worth mentioning there's actually an opposing syndrome to DSPD called [advanced sleep phase disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_sleep_phase_disorder) (ASPD).

Though you would have a mild form of it at best (if at all). 10PM is a pretty standard bed time if we're looking at societal norms.
Closest one to me is "Gulf Coast Jewish Family Services".

That would be a weird place to have a raid.
Most people would probably see their primary and get a referral for a sleep specialist. You could probably skip the referral and just look for a sleep physician yourself. Just make sure it's in-network. :)
I did something pretty similar.

For years, I would sleep for 3-4 hours a night. Roughly 4-5am to 8:30am. Then when I got home from work I'd get a 2 hour nap in around 8pm to 10pm. Rinse and repeat-- sometimes sleeping for like 10+ hours on the weekend to "catch back up".

I made it work somehow. But just being able to sleep 4-5am to noon-ish works a lot better for me.

...except for days like today when I have an early meeting. üò™
I was actually diagnosed with something called "delayed sleep phase disorder." For as long as I remember, I just can't get tired before 3 or 4am. Drugs help temporarily. Light/dark therapy didn't do anything.

So what I did was get a full remote job with a group in California while living on the east coast. They don't start moving until 10am, so my go time is now 1pm.

I can't tell you how much my life improved after this. Before when I tried to force it, I just had constant mental lag. Some people are just not morning people. Period. 
Lucky I don't have to call out of blue rarely ever anymore. 

As a software engineer working full remote, it goes like this:

In Slack: "time for quick call?"

Them: "sure"

Push button.

So much easier than straight dialing someone.

That's when all the dominoes fall and the chorus will begin. It's going to be glorious.

Just got a 60k Platinum (UPGRADE) offer for my Gold Premier cards.

Is this worth it?
I love mine. I just sent the Chromebook Pro back after trying it for the weekend-- couldn't deal with the keyboard. Now I know for sure which of the two I prefer.

I like the MUCH better keyboard (tactile, travel, back-lighting, width) over the better screen of the Pro. Just not worth the trade for me.
Strictly speaking pain-wise: I think I have kidney stones beat. Ever heard of a cluster headache before?

Another name for it is "suicide headache" because people that are experiencing it often contemplate killing themselves to stop the pain.

That shit is no joke.

A huge upgrade if you have anything more than a couple tabs open at one time.
If it's of any comfort, coming from someone in the field (kinda, I'm in machine learning and have been involved in projects as a data scientist for creating sound clips based on deep neural networks, etc.):

Even in a perfect world where they had the precise audio needed to clip together, it would still be impossible to do to such an extent that it would pass professional scrutiny. Metadata aside, there are just too many variables within the audio itself.

... and they definitely don't have the perfect audio to clip anyway.

It would be suicide to try and doctor audio. Remember-- with Nixon, it wasn't the crime, it was the cover-up. They would be better off releasing the real tapes of him asking for loyalty instead of doctored ones where he doesn't. I know that we say "that would be the last straw" a lot... but no... for real; if we had proof he doctored audio "proof" of the FBI director incriminating himself or covering up the President's obstructions (fake/falsified evidence), that would be game over. GG. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. He would "resign" by the end of the week.
4/7 is the fractional odds. 4 to 7 on your money. Decimal version of that, (like you mention), would be 1.57.

That is a 63.64% probability.

Consider that 1/100 is 1.01, or a 99% probability.

That 1+ is what you are missing.

probability = odds / 1+ odds

(4 / 7) / (1 + (4 / 7)) = ~36%

100 - 36 = 64. <-- this is where the 63.6% is coming from

Hope that helps.

Dude come on, this is embarrassing. We can see you're ScotHib. We can see you talking to yourself [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/6e3j1l/discussion_now_that_screenshot_rules_changed/di7cyeq/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IASIP/comments/6c8fwt/what_is_your_most_despised_moment_in_iasip/dhu08ae/?context=3).

Why do you keep coming back and doing this? You "doxxing him" (the zslayer in /r/PokemonGo doesn't even live in the same state as the one you kept dropping information on) was not an "event." No one saw or cared about it.

You're not hard to find on social media either. I bet you can find me too. Are you doing to dox me next? I could just DM you on Twitter now and save you the effort.

Just stop. Please.
Come on now. I know it's cool to get on the bandwagon but let's be real here for one second.

You forgot about Turkey. 
Wow that's #hardcore.

I'm with you. I've spent about $1000 at this point in boxes. No skull icon.
I will always upvote this one.
If the majority of people agree with you, then these posts shouldn't make it to the front page and you won't see them. That's the goal with this rule change.

If you are in the minority and are also unable to filter out the posts, and you hate them so much that you "avoid the subreddit" then I honestly don't know what else to tell you. We want everyone to be happy, but there's only so much slack in this rope.
It's impossible to please everyone. Inevitably, there will be people upset with rule changes. I wanted to give some insight on the rationale behind this one:

I understand that there are some people that just really, really hate screenshots. One thing we have tried to remain strict on is proper flairing of such posts so that you can personally filter them out. I know this is a little easier on the desktop than on mobile apps (and sometimes not possible at all), but it's one of the several efforts that we are trying.

There are often screenshots that will have thousands and thousands of upvotes, make it to /r/all, and have a 90%+ ratio. But they will be breaking the rules and we'd have to remove them. This obviously feels like shit to do and having to explain to some users after the inevitable modmail isn't fun either. "dems the rules!" It's hard to argue that such a post is "low quality" when it was so universally liked. I say this knowing that there will always be a vocal group against these screenshots.

I know we all have a general idea about what makes a "low quality" screenshot. But there is still an uncomfortable amount of subjectivity and often times removals will result in pretty heated discussions in our private moderator chats. Those who have been around a while know that we've tried a lot of different things to try and make as many people happy as possible.

The current goal is to make our content-based moderation **as objective as possible**. This allows you, the users, to determine which threads will make it out of /new. If you like to hang out in new and you really hate screenshots, you can downvote to your heart's content.

Some people hate AR shots. Some people hate screenshots. Some people hate everything. We'll let the users decide which content they like, just as Reddit intended. At least for this trial.

This doesn't mean we are leaving moderation up to up/down votes. All of the other rules apply, including trying to circumvent the minimum text rule with gibberish. Those posts will be removed and abusing that can and will lead to bans.

We want as many happy users as possible. I wish I could personally make every sub happy all the time, but alas, on to another trial.

I love you all üíñ.

> yes, VSCode works well on ARM

This isn't true at all. At least today.

It didn't build at all until headmelted started producing this: https://github.com/headmelted/codebuilds. These unfortunately get out of date quickly, so you'll always be behind.

The goal is that eventually Microsoft starts accepting it and these builds move upstream (you can follow that [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/6442)). But that's not today.

I would avoid ARM Chromebooks if you really want to build a lot of this stuff today.
Oh, please. Nothing is going to stop them from "the Libtards forced him to resign by concocting conspiracy theories!"

"The great President Trump resigned because of all the fighting! Even though he was innocent, he did what he thought would help Make America Great Again!"
> They'll insist until they die that he doesn't deserve it. The continue to support candidates like him, and candidates like him will continue to pop up, eager for their vote.

Him resigning and being pardoned wouldn't change this one bit. Those people are a lost cause.
Hm, an XPS Chromebook. Interesting.
Yeah, I was there. It was literally announced in passing in a tent at the conference. I think it was day 2.

I thought that could have been a headline during the keynote.
Smoking gun tape dropping is what nearly immediately led to his resignation. 
The overlord AI will remember your transgressions in the future. I would look into a faraday cage or something if you can find one.

I'm personally terrified. I tried to shut down one of /u/PGOBot's sister bots and it deleted my account and de-modded me.
Aaaand it's out of (pre-order) stock.
I think it's newish. I'm a Nexus/Pixel person myself, so I'm not entirely sure.

But as a mod, we've gotten enough reports about that orange thing in lots of other posts that I know it's not some kind of cheating app.
Some Samsung-specific game thingy. It's legit.
That wasn't very nice. My bots have feelings.
Nothing beats the year that I got a free LTE Pixel. I think that was 2013? :)

If they can push ChromeOS as a viable development platform, that will be HUGE for adoption. There are already commits out there showing that they are working on getting Android Studio running natively. I'd also like to see some stuff for the web devs too, but that's a huge step forward.
Having been to every I/O since 2012, I can tell you this is the first year they are splitting the keynote into two. The first one is the one with Sundar and it seems to be solely focused on Google and product/service announcements. The developer-specific keynote follows that.

So, this year might be different.

That's not true. Historically, new President's party gets thrashed in the first mid-terms. There are like 2 exceptions in the last 150 years. 
Agreed. I have ~50 hours in her for this season. I'll often pick her because I have a lot of fun with her but if the game gets super tight I'll switch to pretty much any other DPS to finish the game.

No Type-C is DOA status for me, personally.
I will repeat the question: What new device (from anyone) in the last year doesn't have Type-C ports?

This includes phones. Every new phone is also USB Type-C. Give me an example (that's not a $50 budget phone or something like that).
What new device (from anyone) in the last year doesn't have Type-C ports?
No USB Type-C port? That's a typo right?
You only have 2 hours to reply to the bot. You replied almost 4 hours later. Need to make a new thread.
Yeah, it was. I enjoyed most of the series, but that episode was rough. That song in particular was... difficult to watch. You know the one.
Some places just have this latency from the lines. Matchmaker takes it into account and will match him against players with similar pings. That's the most important part. 
Who took back those accusations? We are a group of volunteers who are working to try and keep this a clean and enjoyable subreddit. You had a post removed over a month ago and have since taken every chance you could at insulting the mod team or a mod in general. Your modmail is also pretty colorful.

There are no "accusations". We have records of every comment, thread, and message. There are just facts. You talk about how you expect people to defend themselves-- does that only apply to you? You attacked the entire mod team (more times than I feel like counting). Are we allowed to respond too? Stop trying to incite arguments. You have been given a completely fair amount of warnings at this point. Please consider mine the last one you'll get.
Just saying the word "mod" is enough to get the entire team's attention.

So.. hello... /u/zslayer89 responded already for this thread in this chain.
If you see someone being attacked or harassed, please **please** report it. We do have a lot of filters and alerts with our tools but it doesn't catch everything-- your reports really do help us.
And we regularly remove these comments. So if you see something like this, please report it so we can action on it. That's literally the most our (or any) mod team can do.
Having held both, I also agree with this sentiment. Both are quality devices but the ASUS feels.. for lack of a better way to phrase it.. more "Macbook-like". I like the straight edges on the C302 a lot more.
> faster processor

Aren't they both rocking an m3 @ 2.2? With bigger, faster options (m5/m7) coming to the ASUS later?

Being rude and attacking people trying to help you will get you no where fast.
Friend from college-- a good person. Sometimes got a little hot-headed at parties, but nothing too crazy. Very religious guy too.

One day he gets into a random crash near his house. He was possibly DUI but police got him back to his house. They say he was very cooperative and respectful. Not sure what exactly happened there. But now at home, he just snaps. He digs into a cache of guns and starts lighting up random walls and furniture in his house. Then his mother came home.

This is a small college town and everyone knew the mother. Sweet nurse at a nearby school district who was kind and warm to everyone. She asks her son about all the bullet holes so he walks into the room and shoots her twice in the head, instantly(at least I hope), killing her.

Then he goes and sits down on the couch and watches TV. Apparently just blankly and completely out of it. Sits there until his father gets home and that's when he takes off before eventually getting caught.

AFAIK, no one ever really found out what happened or why he snapped. But yeah, he's locked up for life.

He was permanently banned from our sub as well, despite him calling it a "cool-down period." Actually made me look pretty bad with my mod team as I originally defended him.

Then we got irrefutable proof of him using alt accounts and making derogatory comments and deleting them. After way too many warnings with way too many people, he was permanently banned from /r/pokemongo as well.
FWIW, you picked one of the few games that run fantastic on (newer) Chromebooks with the Play Store.

You won't be able to run a Windows/Mac game on it. But most Android games work great and often times perform even better than they would on a phone. Hearthstone (via Android) is one of those games.
Agreed, it's a powerhouse. I remember bringing mine to I/O 2013 (where they gave away the OG Pixel). From that day, the C720 was relegated to sitting on my nightstand, where I have used it literally every night of the week for the last ~3 years. Watching YouTube, Twitch, etc. I love that thing.
This is insane. I mean that in the kindest way possible. Don't even think about it. No way. No.

No no no no no.
As if mods could ever win. A simple defined list of things get removed, and people bitch and moan about inconsistency. Things don't get removed, people bitch and moan about favoritism. Don't have the rule at all, people bitch and moan about the "quality of the sub because of all the stupid reposts."

Please. We're used to it.
We literally get a notification if someone says the word moderators.
I actually feel bad for you. You still pretend to know what you're talking about. You still continue to make up facts. And now you personally attack me? And what the hell are you talking about, homophobic PM? Are you really ready to make that up too? I can reach out to an admin if that's where you're going next. 
No, that's still absolutely wrong. Barely any are just "windowed apps or extensions". What does that even mean? Chrome Apps are an entirely different platform with an entirely different SDK (that's MORE open than the Extension platform, not LESS). What you are saying makes no sense. I have several apps on the Web Store and I know what I'm talking about. It's very clear that you do not. 
Yeah, that's not true at all. There is a big difference between Apps and Extensions. Having developed for both platforms. That has nothing at all to do with the App Launcher, which was removed some time ago.

Apps are going away for everyone except ChromeOS. There are a lot of Apps and they are not just "windowed extensions."

Yes.
I'm assuming he's talking about Pine Gap. We have military bases everywhere. 38 abroad, unless that number has changed recently. 

Edit: yeah, 38 "named" bases. So way more installations than that. We probably have more than that in Germany alone. 
And almost every US state too. A lot of people here seem to be under the impression there's some federal law that prohibits overtaking more than one car at a time. There isn't.
I'd challenge you to find me a law anywhere that limits the amount of cars you can overtake at once. I'm sure there's a few of them out there, but it won't be easy. I know for certain that most (all?) US states have no such limit.
Fair enough, but I'm having a hard time finding that. I travel a lot in NY myself (I'm originally from PA). I see nothing in the statute about one car at a time. I don't mean to bother you, but if you have the link handy I would appreciate it as it would be good knowledge to have.

It was my understanding that such a law doesn't really exist in most (if any?) states. I know for certain it's legal here in Florida.
But it's not?
Illegal in what states? It's perfectly legal in all the states I travel in. I'm curious on what state you live where there is a limit?
It's simple and reasonable if you think about it.

Before you start passing, it is your responsibility to make sure you can safely pass (no oncoming traffic and no one crossing in front of you). From what we can see from the video, the driver did this.

Then he starts a legal overtake. If you are turning left (the cop), it is your responsibility to make sure you can safely turn (no oncoming traffic and no one currently passing). We can see from the video that the police officer failed to do this.

How can the passer be blamed? What he was doing is perfectly legal.
Sirata is always a safe bet.
That's not true at all. Devices bought from Verizon have encrypted bootloaders. It has nothing at all to do with your SIM.
FWIW: I don't unlock my bootloader to flash ROMs. I stopped doing that shit yeeeeears ago.

But you need an unlocked bootloader for a lot of things, not just flashing ROMs. Flashing the latest O images come to mind immediately.
> I'm actually afraid to post a screenshot now for fear of getting banned for a week if it doesn't meet mod expectations.

This really hurts me to read. That is the last thing we want anyone to feel when contributing on our sub.

We will make some changes. Thank you for your feedback. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"It's the same as with hitscan, except it doesn't work."

The entire point of an aimbot *is* accuracy. If you can't account for x and y then you might as well call it "aim assist."
I don't believe you. I've also flown on hundreds of flights (literally got off a plane an hour ago) and I would say probably 1 out of every 10 landings, there's some random goofballs that start clapping when the plane lands. Especially if it was a rough landing.
It's the same price pretty much everywhere.

$7.50 (burrito) + $1.95 (guac) + $2.10 (large soda) + tax.

~$12-13 is about right.

Subtract $1 if you get chicken instead of Steak/Barbacoa.

It would be $6.50 (+ tax) for a chicken burrito and nothing else. Even in Central VA.
That's clearly a screenshot, not a photo.

1) Posts with hundreds (sometimes even thousands) are removed all of the time if they are noticed a little late.

2) It's no where near a "split." The people that "hate" screenshots are in a very clear minority. Our current rules **are** the compromise. The super generic ones that we can scratch off a list are removed (and likely to be downvoted anyway). We also ensure that screenshots are tagged properly so that anyone who is offended by seeing screenshots can easily filter them out.

It's Pokemon GO, after all. There's not going to be heavy min-maxing discussions going on all of the time. We want people who are excited to be able to post here and chat with other members of the community.
What?
No other action has been taken against you by any mod on my team. I assure you, you are not being "targeted" by anyone.

What? No one is "unfairly" targetting you.

You had one thread that was automatically removed by AutoModerator because it fell short of the text minimum. It was a bot. A bot that moderates every single thread, not just yours.
