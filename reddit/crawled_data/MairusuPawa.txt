Multi-cables for consoles from this era tend to be composite only, sometimes with an accompanying fake s-video plug at the end. If that's the case, I don't recommend going this way at all - your picture will look like utter shit especially on a flat screen.

Unless that is a YUV cable, which should then be decent enough to do the job even if it's a low quality one.
Congratulations on being fucking late on joining the modern world each and every time, then. We had RGB as the default standard for everything, including Nintendo consoles, since the late 70s / early 80s. My MSX runs in RGB. My NES has a (shitty Nintendo-made) RGB output.

Still waiting for you to adopt the metric system by the way. That "use a router to cut out 5-7/8” by 5-7/8” down to ¼” then cut a 2-7/8” hole" for a CAD project of mine has been annoying as fuck.
Much better! Thanks!

Seule exception notable : les quelques trajets qui font une vague pause avant de rejoindre la Suisse - dans ce cas, putain que ça brille de partout.

Interesting! I'm not sure when I should call the `release` function though, at the very end of the `loop` with a catch-all `Keyboard.releaseAll()` or something like

    if (digitalRead(pinballrButton) == LOW) {
      keyboard.press(KEY_RIGHT_CTRL);
      keyboard.release(KEY_RIGHT_CTRL);
    }

for each key?

I'm also worried that using `Keyboard.begin()` will take over the regular keyboard's machine too. I'd ideally still need access to it from time to time, preferably without having to disable the Arduino (I'm a tad worried about the "the Arduino takes over your computer's keyboard!" message seen on the wiki).
I unfortunately do not have the same experience as of now.

This seems to run much better than Dreamcast emulators and the PS2 is a complicated beast to tame. I call bullshit.
They're DFGTs! They're actually really cheap, as most people who used them for GT on PS3 are getting rid of them because they take a lot of space and are not compatible with GT on PS4 (yet work fine on PC). Issue is, they're sequential and nothing else, making MT gameplay a tad awkward (with h2seq).
The Daytona setup runs on 8 dedicated computers on a LAN, using M2emulator and M2lagfix. That way we got the crystal clear original version with force feedback.

A bunch of PS3s would not work because the PSN would get in the way. It would also be more expensive and less practical overall (the Model2 emulated setup can run other games as well, such as Sega Rally).

Yep! She did help me setup m2lagfix on that network, actually, providing very useful directions. And I'm glad she developed the tool in the first place - as of now, M2emu is still the best option available for this kind of stuff by far, but that best just isn't good enough (glitches glitches glitches with network game rings, meaning only Daytona and Sega Rally really somewhat work on a LAN and other games just can't sync).

One of the reason I'd like MAME to *finally* give some love to Model 2 is that I'd be able to get rid of Windows too, which is a huge pain in the ass with networking as well and just always seems to finds creative ways to just fuck up randomly. And yeah, that's on the OS level, not on M2emu nor MAME. And I'd *need* the polygons to be drawn by the GPU, because the low-power Z3735F simply doesn't have enough under the hood to run the game with software rendering.

Oh come on. I'm tired of OSes making room for shitty ISP practices in NA instead of the other way around. Don't waste time on this, Gnome devs.

In fact, seeing this feature being a default in Win10 already really is problematic - it's encouraging local ISPs to become more Comcast-like since "the feature is already available so might as well use it" instead of keeping things the way they are and should be, eg no caps on data be it mobile contracts or landlines.

Kids who grew up on Microsoft have no idea MS didn't rule the world and hardly were a staple of quality software. They were known for their market aggressiveness though, in fact their name appearing alongside "partners" usually were a bad omen for said partners. In fact, they outright killed several major companies in my country because they did not follow suite on the contracts they signed with them. The various anti-monopoly lawsuits they faced didn't just come out of nowhere.

And they do rewrite History, often. The Living Computer Museum in Seattle is a prime example of such a thing - because it's sponsored by a former Microsoft exec, the "museum" doesn't quite tell the history of how we got there; I'd say about 80% of its content is focused on "this is why Microsoft seized this market, and their success was solely due to the character of the innovative product they launched".

No, companies (including Nintendo) were following Sega and Namco, and building on top of their experiences. In fact, Nintendo rarely was innovative even if pop culture bias now tends to think otherwise, but that's another long story.

And arguably the most influential 3D console was the PS1. Took the market with a perfect storm of pricing, distribution, and support - thanks to both Nintendo *and* Sega fucking up. The reason why it focused on 3D was because Virtua Fighter showed the world games could work that way and be both fun and intense. Not my favorite of that generation hardware-wise but hey, all of them were host to fantastic games anyway in the end.
Eh, I could easily fit a dozen Linux installs on one of these and still have space for some data.
Yeah, that was NiGHTS on a Toys'r'Us demo kiosk.

I did see Virtua Fighter and Virtua Formula in the arcades before, but was much younger and did not get a chance to actually play them. I was mesmerized by the rolling demos still.
Hey, let's not rewrite history here. Namco's System 21 and Sega's Model 1 were the ones to lead the industry into 3D gaming, experimenting with gameplay ideas and new technical features thanks to an army of incredibly skilled dev teams.

Nintendo merely bought the v2 of a chipset Sega bugfix'd and eventually rejected, building that console around it. In fact I still wonder what Nintendo would have built after the SNES if Sega wasn't around then, it's like they had no plans.
Maybe it isn't because it's a conservative opinion, but because the idea you are trying to promote is indeed a piece of shit one regardless of sides.

I had three OLED phones in total and all of them were used for a very long time: HTC Desire, Nexus 4, and (currently) Lenovo Zuk Z2 Pro.

None of them show any burn-in, and that includes my HTC Desire that I'm still using as a semi-smart car dashboard.

Or was it? It was a Win10 and Xbox exclusive this time around, and Microsoft spent a lot of money for that.
Amazing that they'd rather do that than their actual job.
Tails went from being a genius preteenager growing up, to a "relatable" token 6 years old for marketing purposes.
Did you try http://www.shenmuedojo.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=46995 ?
Yes and no. Thing is, these games were all initially planned for the Dreamcast. Microsoft just used their deep pockets to have them on their console instead. They also bought a lot of Sega hardware staff members.

When the Xbox launched, MS had no idea how they could even sell a console. They had no clear vision, they did not have something enticing to upsell developers, they had a lot of trouble getting started on the market with a high price. Japanese developpers notably were confused by what MS was trying to achieve - Sony wanted games to feel like AAA movies, Nintendo wanted fun first and foremost, Sega wanted arcade-style fast-paced games and boundary-breaking experiments, and Microsoft? No fucking clue. Plus, Microsoft had a tendency to meddle with developers too much, for instance they wanted Abe's Odyssey to be their Mario.

In the end they just brute-forced the market, an easy enough thing to do when you have unlimited money. They kind of lucked out buying Halo and preventing it from releasing as a Mac exclusive game, and found their poster child to push the business strategy they wanted from the start: selling an expensive subscription-based revenue stream with the console, in the form of online gaming.

There's really no need to try and claim it was a "Dreamcast 2", because that's ignoring the fact that Sega out other exclusive games on other competitors' machines as well. It didn't get games such as Billy Hatcher or Shinobi.
Come to think of it, there's something I didn't consider at all when I posted my initial comment : maybe the color bleed and the blur is due to the camera and the way you took the picture, and not your setup?

Samba de Amigo was not a mail-order thing. Supplies were low though, for instance only 500 units were available in France and exclusively at FNAC stores.

Also the video shows Samba 2000, an update of the game that includes everything from regular Samba but one of the minigames, and is a Japan exclusive. Hence the texts in Japanese.

There's no other connector, the internal ribbon is a very short one. There's an external SCSI port that might be on the same bus maybe? I haven't tried following the traces on the PCB yet, but supposedly that's how it's supposed to work? I'm not familiar with SCSI.

If I connect another drive with a SCSI ribbon (or external SCSI), what kind of software could I use to clone the running system? I believe the LC is running OS 7.
Honestly I'm not sure. Something with the way their supply chain works and related to the deals they have backstage. Apparently they could give it away and still make money, but the catch was that the product needed to be proven to be *sold* for them to make some provision work on the financial sides of things.

I believe this is the real reason the State is stepping up. Not because of the riots, but because there's something weird here and they don't want to see the idea grow.

You can install [Pseudo Saturn Kai](http://ppcenter.webou.net/pskai/) on a 4-in-1 Action Replay using the [swap trick](http://www.racketboy.com/retro/learn-how-to-perform-sega-saturn-swap) method to boot up the burned install disc, and then

>Can the modded PS AR cart still run out of region games?

Yes, this makes the Saturn region-free. This doesn't change its frequency though so PAL games will run at 60Hz (which is only an issue with [PAL-optimised releases](http://randomisedgaming.tumblr.com/post/146372446412/the-complete-european-sega-saturn-60hz-guide-to) - but afaik none of the PAL-exclusive games are impacted).

>Can I play games that need a RAM cart?

Yes, the RAM part of the Action Replay will still be available for the games to use.
Wait, you can run Triforce games on a Wii?
A bit of warning though, that Megadrive clone is a gigantic pile of crap.

Two gaming peripherals I'd like to be able to use in Linux:

* My PEXHDCAP capture card, to capture raw SCART 240p videos. Doesn't work at all. Micomsoft says they won't publish a Linux driver because this would require them to break the HDMI/HDCP licencing deals they have.
* My HTC Vive. Works partially. Unfortunately game performance is severely lacking compared to Windows, meaning that even when using low settings the experience doesn't reach 90fps and isn't smooth sailing at all.
No. They'll boot but play slower than expected. This is usually noticeable in FMVs, because the video and audio go out of sync.

You'll need a hardware mod to switch the console to 60Hz.

Games that can run in PAL60 will give you the option to do so on boot. You will see a menu first, in which you can decide between 50hz, 60hz, or a test mode. If there's no menu, it's 50hz only.

VGA mode always uses 60Hz.

I guess you ran into a PAL conversion issue. The game was probably optimized for 50Hz and this maybe broke a few things when running it in VGA mode, considered minor at the time. You could test this hypothesis by forcing your PAL copy to run in PAL60 (with a DC-X? Patched iso? Boot disc?) with SCART: you should run into the same issue if that's the case.
When you tried with SCART, was that in PAL60?

Also no, using another VGA cable won't have any impact.
Oh, you're one of the the_donald lunatics.

Japanese Megadrive has that as well. That would have helped, if it were one.
No. Just don't. Especially on systems like the Megadrive, where it's a soft reset button that's supposed to keep the content of the console's RAM intact.

And due to the way these systems work, it's exactly like if you were removing your computer's BIOS chip when it's running.
Game cartridges do not work like USB thumb sticks. You have to turn the Megadrive off before switching games.

Thanks a lot, again, for the detailed explanation. I think I'll go for the Sprite design, but the drivers are a bit tricky to find over here, especially the 4ohm ones (if it makes sens to go this way). I'm thinking of going for a LP-838 when it comes to the amp, as some users of the shaker I have seem to report decent results with it (hence, I can still use it despite its flaws, won't go too much to waste; and if it doesn't work out, I'll still have a usable setup without them if it turns out to be a shitty idea.

I think I can make enough room for front-facing vents. A bandpass enclosure would be a neat idea but adds too much complexity to the project, I think; plus I don't think I'm up to the task of designing one.

The Sprite build page says that the ND90s sound a bit brittle in higher frequencies. Maybe it could make sense to still use the ND16FA-6 tweeters I already have?
I have a feeling this is a bot.

Crackle.
Ye, but it's 02:39
Thanks a lot! Unfortunately I can't directly order from Parts Express due to ridiculous shipping fees, so I wasn't aware of existing kits like the C-note one for instance. The speakers are likely too big for my project, anyway, as the B3N are already pushing it.

Could you elaborate on why the parts don't work with that crossover? I don't know what to look for, and would love to learn a bit.

I'm not sure what you mean by specific crossover for the ND16. I've tried using the B3N without the tweeter (connected directly to the amp board, without the crossover) and it seemed to me that having the tweeter present does improve the sound, especially for retro sound (my go-to test is [Go Straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KC-B3Q0cRrY)). Lacking in bass, yes… I expected something closer to a full-range speaker, guess I fucked up.

The bass shaker is something I've never tried before and wanted to experiment with, especially given the price. Reviews of this one do say they tend to break easily when used in a regular home cinema setup. I'm hooking that to an [arcade stool](http://www.rklok.nl/pics/Nozomi/stools.jpg), which is very lightweight. Could you point me to a plate amp and shaker combo example? Much appreciated.

The Sprite seems very promising! But there are two caveats I'll run into if I were to use this design. First one is that I can't really have vents on the back on the sound bar part of the bartop, as that's where electronics component will be (computer motherboard, etc). Second one is that the enclosure is too deep as well… unless I don't build an internal enclosure for the sound part, but the Sprite seems to depend quite a bit on it (the design is tuned that way apparently).

My current bartop plans are something similar to http://hico-srv004.pixhotel.fr/sites/default/files/gamoovernet/20160415114818-viking-Bartop-WIP-001.jpg but with the speakers relocated under the screen, room for a mini-itx motherboard, and a larger panel.

You can fry it if you do that. There are a few different PSUs for the Saturn (known as A, B, and C) and they're not always pin-compatible between regions.
Yes, but there are variations inside the cases when it comes to screw holes.
First and foremost, that's pretty neat to see you asking feedback over here on Reddit, so, thanks!

Les 480 et 580 ne suivent en effet pas vraiment le MSRP depuis leurs sorties, comme pour les Vega. Ceci dit, même en considérant l'augmentation des coûts de la RAM et l'ajout des fonctions à la con par les constructeurs (comme le RGB partout), ça ne suffit pas vraiment à expliquer leurs tarifs actuels en effet. Par curiosité j'ai jeté un œil sur les graphes de prix de rue-montgallet et on constate bien un boom significatif en août sur presque tous les modèles, et un autre en décembre.

L'autre chose rigolote est d'aller voir les occasions sur LeBonCoin. En cherchant des 580 sur la région parisienne, je tombe sur une bonne grosse quantité de rigs minage clés en main.

J'ai tout simplement raté ce phénomène.
J'ai vu ton lien et, oui, tout va bien. Je pense juste que tu n'as pas suivi les informations sur cette gamme de cartes graphiques.

Je vois des Radeon à la pelle sur Amazon et à leur prix normal (qui n'est hélas pas le prix d'annonce que AMD balançait avant leur mise en vente mais n'est pas une surprise, tu trouveras des articles gueulant sur cette stratégie marketing sur HFR et PCI). Pas de ruptures… Je peux aussi passer à LDLC à côté et te prendre en photo leurs rayons GPU aussi, c'est plein.

L'explosion du prix de la RAM n'a rien à voir avec les crypto, et note que les cartes graphiques ont *aussi* besoin de mémoire vive. De beaucoup de mémoire vive. Pas le même type mais le même bordel côté production et tarifs. La stagnation des prix du stockage fait chier aussi, et là aussi n'a aucun lien avec les cryptomonnaies. L'explosion du prix des écrans n'a rien non plus à voir avec la choucroute.

Par contre on a fait du progrès sur la customisation, on a droit à du RGB partout comme excuse. Même sur les alimentations. Bordel.
On peut déjà ? Pas besoin d'importer les memes USA qui n'ont aucune réalité de marché ici ?

Et je te rassure, tu ne peux toujours pas acheter de RAM à prix correct, ce qui n'a rien à voir avec les cryptomonnaies.

If they don't make a push to actually sell the game before summer break I'll be utterly disappointed. And I wouldn't be that surprised if they abandon it due to an unsurprising "lack of sales".

The Xbox controller is a derivative of the Dreamcast one (which is a progression from the Saturn 3D one, which comes from the Saturn one, which comes from the Megadrive 6btn one, etc). The Dreamcast do not have that 8 button "dynamic" and Microsoft never intended to have one (nor Nintendo for that regard).

When games were ported from the PS2 to the Xbox, developers just broke what the intended use case of these buttons was because it was much easier than rewrite a full control scheme. That's about it. The fun part is that games that used the analog face buttons on the PS2 did use the pressure sensitive face buttons on the Xbox as well, eg Metal Gear 2 (iirc, it's been a long time).

Another thing is that Xbox-exclusive games were also quick to just ditch the intended use of the two online-dedicated buttons because it was a meh idea in most scenario. For instance, the Dead or Alive series just uses them as if the controller was a regular (but weirdly shaped) 6 buttons controller.
That's no longer the case.
No. They were originally meant to be used for Xbox Live vocal chats / PTT. One of them was supposed to always be "talk to all" and the other "talk only to team".

This happened to me as well in another form. It didn't just stop working randomly, but was *lost* when the school decided to switch from a self-hosted webmail to MS Outlook Web. The change basically happened nearly overnight without warning, and interestingly enough, other similar schools over the country did the exact same thing at the nearly exact same time back then. Friends in other schools told me there was not much of a warning beforehand either.

I suspect a very shady deal had been made with Microsoft at this point in time.

I used to have the original Desire. It was such a success, people didn't update to newer devices as they planned it (the low storage was meant to limit users but everyone learned what a symlimk is). They freaked out, locked down everything on their next phones, and - incidentally - killed sales even more.
I would be very okay with that if manufacturers weren't locking down bootloaders and were cooperative with xda-dev folks for a community-based support system.

Card packs are essentially DLC, the same as if you'd buy new tracks in Rock Band. And the whole business model, where the most money is made, is selling these extra cards.

Which also means like, similarly to Rock Band, licencing deals can expire over time. I wonder if a few years down the roads cards will have to be removed from the game (eg, no audio).
This isn't online play though. This is different.
That's retarded.
MS didn't pioneer that much when it comes to online gaming on consoles. All they did was monetize it by putting it behind monthly fees. Sega did all the hard work.

To elaborate a bit - Sega experimented with online gaming since the Megadrive and its [Mega Modem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Meganet) (unreleased in the US), ramped it up on the [Saturn](https://segaretro.org/Sega_Saturn_Modem) and included the functionality by default inside the Dreamcast then. Everything you found on Xbox Live started one way or another on the Dreamcast: dedicated servers (Phantasy Star Online), voice chat and parties (Planet Ring… and while at it, Nintendo pretty much stole Dream Dorobo's asymmetrical gameplay for their Luigi's Mansion minigame on Wii U), downloadable content (Sonic Adventure 1 events), buying keys to unlock full games if you only had the demo ([@barai](https://segaretro.org/@barai))… etc.

When Peter Moore killed Sega and was offered a cat pay check to move and work at Microsoft, he pretty much brought along SegaNet (and its devs) with him. Microsoft put a shiny Xbox Live logo over SegaNet, generalised monthly fees (until then, only Phantasy Star Online 2 had that with the "Hunter's Pass") and called it a day.
Do you still have that pdf around?

Still love the thing, by the way, its tracking is superb and its lack of ties to Facebook (for which I refuse to ever have an account) pleases me greatly.

Anyway. Oculus is hogging VR games. The opposite isn't so true and it's entertaining reading about PSVR and Rift owners discovering experiences I enjoyed a year or so ago, as the features like motion controllers catch on. It's pretty neat, feels like it's going mainstream. So, erm, when do I get to play the few Oculus exclusive games natively on SteamVR? When does Oculus get rid of its silly walled garden?

Ça me paraît plus intelligent d'autoriser le cannabis que la cigarette niveau santé, mais peut-être que je me fais des fausses idées ?
The answer is already in my previous post :)

Basically the NES sends two black test frames in succession instead of a single screen flash. Since the CRT has zero latency, it can test each frame independently without the player noticing. It still has no idea what you are pointing at, but guesses the duck ID when it registers a "yes".

The downside of this trick is that the more targets you have on screen, the more test frames you need to push, and the more noticeable and annoying the flashes become.

And you still can't track the gun's coordinates, so there's no way to draw bullet impacts on a wall when you missed for instance (a big reason why they went with an outdoor theme, the other one being that [it's a copy of already existing popular games](http://www.pinrepair.com/arcade/sduckhu.htm)).
Enough.
No. Please stop playing dumb for the sake of it.
No. The game only knows "yes" and "no". Period. That's it. That's how it is.

Again, you could just as well shoot outside of the screen at a lamp or a bright window, and it would work the same.
Thanks for the downvotes. They were stupid because I'm technically and demonstrably right.

The duck flashes a white square when you press the trigger, while the rest of the screen becomes black. The gun's light sensor sees white and that's a "yes", the NES displays the "duck is hit" animation. That's all there is to it. You could basically aim at a lamp and kill ducks each and every time you pressed the trigger.

Some games showed two targets on screen and used two "hit" frames instead of one. Each target would have a white square drawn over it in rapid succession. The NES who then get a "yes" then "no" response and act accordingly.

At no point the gun knows the coordinates of what you're pointing at on screen. That's unlike nearly all other guns on the market available at the time. With a Master System Light Phaser for instance, you could have an infinite number of targets on screen - some shooting game I don't remember the name of allowed you to shoot multiple bandits and bottles in a bar, for instance.
I actually use one to send analog video over the air to a fleet of Game Gear TV tuners. I run a composite video source through it, so it's converted to RF, then use a powered antenna booster thing, which then goes to a generic antenna. Pretty much a reverse way of what you're supposed to do but it does work and my Game Gears display the content, even if the signal is very weak (5 meters max, no walls).
The only NES without RCA connectors was the French one, because it used RGB SCART.

Ultimately this meant the picture's quality was abysmal though. The NES works with composite internally (the PPU natively uses it); in order to have a RGB output, Nintendo added - inside the console - one of the worst composite-to-RGB converters they could find. The end result was that you had a shitty picture coming out of the NES that was displayed very accurately on your RGB TV. Compared to the competition it just looked terrible.

A common modification of the console was the removal of this composite-to-rgb encoder, to go back to composite. Even if composite video is significantly worse than RGB SCART, in this exceptional case it was a serious improvement  to use it still.
It's not CRT blur. A tube screen displays very precise and vivid colors. It's the RCA composite video encoding/decoding that's shitty and taken advantage of.

If you lived in a region in which SCART was the default, you never noticed stuff like smooth gradients or fake transparency, you always saw a clear picture with lots of dithering.
That's how every light gun worked indeed, except for the NES one. The Zapper has absolutely no idea where you point it at. All it knows is "yes" or "no" when you pull the trigger.

En règle général tout ce qui touche à des DRMs d'une manière ou d'une autre. Par exemple, ma carte d'acquisition pexhdcap n'est pas gérée par Linux et ne le sera probablement jamais, le fabricant m'ayant directement indiqué avoir voulu produire des pilotes mais ne pouvant pas le faire car bloqué par leur contrat avec le consortium HDMI en particulier à cause de la clause sur le HDCP. Et Micomsoft n'a pas les reins d'un Blackmagic pour se permettre de payer encore plus de royalties et débloquer la situation.

Autre exemple : le CDI du lycée voisin permet le prêt de livres dématérialisés aux élèves. Ça ne fonctionne qu'avec Silverlight, parce que les documents sont verrouillés à un nombre de "prêts" limités. La situation est absolument absurde puisqu'on se retrouve avec des PDF marqués comme "hors stock" une fois que deux ou trois élèves en ont fait un "emprunt". En dehors de la bêtise logique derrière cette plate-forme, il reste qu'il est impossible de s'en servir depuis autre chose qu'un Windows.

Thing is, the Zapper is such a basic piece of tech it actually does have a chance to work if ideal conditions are met - it doesn't rely on tracking the screen at all and won't care about refresh rates or resolution, only latency (and contrast).

Proper light guns, like for the Amstrad CPC or the Sega MasterSystem, do track their actual position on screen and know the exact coordinates of what you're aiming at. Those won't work.

- This limit is due to the fact that there are some data just after the last area code in the 2nd sector (where they are in format like "For JAPAN"). The limit avoids the replacement of those data with extra area codes.

… what insults?

And no, you're definitely not right. I see you're trying to push that idea a lot in this thread though, and you are finding out most definitely disagree with your opinion. It *is* a tech-related piece of news, as it shapes one of the most visited social networks.
I have a feeling you're simply not at ease regarding the current subject, and would rather silence discussion about it.
Uh no. No. Not at all. That wouldn't be talking about Google's cafeteria menu, but about Google's ToS if you really want to go that way. And how would one dare [talking about Google ToS in here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/5dcs32/psa_if_you_violate_any_of_googles_tos_they_will/) in here then.
We can talk about Google, or Facebook, or Amazon here, but not about Reddit?
Is this the new "I'm not racist, but"?

t_d user literally killing his own father due to online endoctrination by the subreddit he likes. The very same subreddit that denies a murder happened in Charlottesville and you have a prime example of that "thought school" [in this very thread](http://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/78v94n/nazi_forums_closed_as_reddit_purges_violent/dox0j5s).

Yet that hate sub is still around.
If true, I'd like to bear my testimony about the_donald, a sub I never posted on yet received surprising communication from its mod team
Il y a sensiblement moins de néonazis américains en dehors des États-Unis qu'aux États-Unis. Curieux, hein.
/g/ n'est plus qu'une sorte de guerre permanente entre publicitaires. Franchement, c'est devenu la board la plus inutile de 4chan.
Tout simplement parce que le laisser aux US a donné [ce genre de chose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTy6f_HyuQU).
Well yeah. It wasn't originally meant for gaming. But Microsoft bought the company developing it, and tried to shoehorn it with their home console as a gimmick answer to the Wiimote, without thinking too much about it could actually be used in fun ways.
>Some people just dont know when they are being manipulated by a Government. We stand (most of the time) because we want to; not because its a public expectation brainwashed into the masses by a government.

Uh-uh
I have two but hadn't had time to test them yet. The reason I chose these ones is, they are the only option for using VirtualOn Saturn Twin Sticks on a Dreamcast.

They do have a lot of great reviews otherwise.
Forcément. Ils n'ont pas le choix s'ils veulent faire tourner Azure. Enfin il y a bien l'option d'utiliser Windows dessus mais ça fait doucement rigoler tout le monde.

Et si je me plante pas, leurs patchs, c'est surtout pour Hyper-V et pas grand chose d'autre.

Basically, ask for an ICEY refund the regular way. Steam will only refund that part of the bundle, and the Steam Link will still be marked as being shipped to your place.

Bit of a shame really, since Icey looks fun. But there's no Linux version anyway, so, eh.
To most of the world, she isn't even on the Left to begin with, even less so a communist obviously - that's just a word they throw around as a gratuitous insult. But for some reason this fact [seems shocking to some](http://np.reddit.com/r/ShitPoliticsSays/comments/77mzy0/only_in_the_us_of_a_would_clinton_ever_be/).
Well, I did, and it worked.
Just *dd* it.
Ha, but see: corporations are people, too.

*cough*
Maybe we should just ask the VLC team.
It's relatively trivial to mod a PAL Saturn so it outputs in 60Hz - some even have the switch directly inside the battery compartment (SW4). Likewise, setting the region is just a matter of (de)soldering an internal jumper.

A bit trickier than the Megadrive or the MasterSystem since there are more "zones" (country codes / bits) but it doesn't take much.
Well, fellow humans, we had a good run
> vr have a habit of giving people motion sickness.

Uh, no. Unless your setup is seriously fucked up.
None.
You bet they did. Linux support on day one.
the_donald thinks Michelle has had a sex change, and used to be a man.

I wish I was kidding.
It's fake.
No.
False. It's a logo recreation by some random dude on the internet, designed specifically with extra geometry for bragging rights. The console never used it.
It's not just a low-effort report of an urban legend. It's also false as fuck (this isn't a dump of the console's model) and people are still eating it up.

Seriously, it's like this sub has no gaming culture.
Also, go collect some karma over at /r/gamecollecting :)
Holy cow!

Two tips:

* Go burn Samba de Amigo 2000 (Japan only release), which includes basically everything you have in the regular version and more songs + more game modes.
* Go get El Bucanero's VMU Backup CD, the DLC unlock songs are available there.

Vu la qualité de ta diatribe, avec plaisir.

It doesn't work because you need a modchip. Not because of PAL/NTSC issues, at all.
It's a (S)NES emulator for the PS2. These have been around since, well, basically forever.
My 980ti is underpowered?
"Il faut être disruptif !" - La personne est incapable de clarifier voir même définir ce qu'elle entend par là, mais aime ressortir le mot depuis qu'elle l'a entendu à la radio.

Dans un autre genre, sans être non plus vraiment une expression toute faite : "la" wifi. Juste non quoi. C'est comme si on parlait en Comic Sans MS, ça ne se fait pas quoi.
Then let's ask Sega for a VR version of All Stars Racing Transformed.
Je suis sans une ville classée au alentours des 500 qu'il paraît. C'est bientôt beau mais on s'y fait chier un max : que des vieux, pas d'activités, enclavée part manque de transports, et moins de 1mbps pour Internet.

Du coup, quel intérêt…
It's not laziness when you're just wasting your time trying to barricade against an ocean of piss, and are not being paid for that.
That's not really how things work
A Sega R360.
What the duck are you even trying to say with that? That's either incredibly dumb or just unclear.
Same here! First person games give me nausea, I tried the demo but couldn't even finish a couple of puzzles before feeling sick. Since it's not an issue in VR, I'm excited to finally be able to play it!
I tried. It doesn't go far and can't be used. It's a bit better than a few months ago though, as there's an executable now (before that, you just had gfx assets like the SteamVR logo in the Steam client).

Now Valve has plans and wants to focus on Vulkan if I'm not mistaken. An interesting prospect but since Windows gamers aren't budging and thus the money's not here (not to mention that they're probably waiting for the X.org/Wayland/Mir situation to be clarified), things are moving in slow motion.
My high-ish level smartphone is $200.
I'm more confident about this than finally seeing support for my pexhdcap card.
Still waiting for SteamVR to be usable on Linux. Been a year.
If you get that, it basically opens the door to the Master System as well.
Continuity tester. Grab a multimeter and check the pinout.
Obviously! They're employees first, humans second.
J'arrive un peu tard mais bon, il y a une autre raison à ça : un objectif marketing simple, pousser les clients vers les cartes d'abonnement plutôt que les places unitaires. Les vendeurs au guichet ont généralement pour consigne de contrer avec l'argument abonnement quand un client rechigne à payer ce genre de tarif exorbitant.

Bien entendu, l'abonnement rapporte bien plus à l'exploitant de la salle que les tickets simples.

Édith: d'ailleurs paf, dans ce fil, y'en a qui ont déjà sauté à pieds joints dans ce mode d'engagement.
I think you can fix the scratches with toothpaste.
Première fois que j'entends ce terme.
What a clean-looking tip.
I regularly see used ones as well. Prices aren't significatif marked down yet though.

Yu Suzuki, and the AM2 team. Through technical excellence, by building specific pieces of hardware and optimizing the shit out of software, they changed the industry forever.

This isn't the 70s anymore.
The fun part is that tech-wise the NES Zapper is by far the shittiest lightgun of its time.
Je continue de me demander pourquoi je me fais chier à bosser.
This is because the BIOS you loaded was set to French before being dumped. I haven't tried myself on Recalbox, but the usual way of switching the language is to boot the Dreamcast without a disc in (launch the emulator with no file loaded) and just go to the Settings menu.

You can also soft-reset the console from a game by pressing all four front buttons (A + B + X + Y) and Start. First time you do that, the game should go back to its title screen; doing that from the title screen throws you back to the internal DC bios.
Not streaming VR, but sharing the games displayed on the big screen.
>agents in CDG refuse to introduce themselves and show their IDs to the point the deliberately hide their ID cards in the pockets

I've had the same experience with Delta agents in CDG basically refusing to say anything about a delayed flight, and not helping me out at all when it turned out it was pushed back to the next day. I literally had to hunt down Delta employees to gain access to an hotel room this night.

Je suppose qu'on parle de http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/05/us/texas-affluenza-teen/index.html ? Toute cette affaire est un bordel monstrueux en effet, dont le thème dominant est la richesse de la famille impliquée.
Y'a rien de neuf. Il est où leur article sur Pier Solar pour Megadrive par exemple ?
Je vois une bonne dose de bullshit jobs autour de moi, certains (très) bien payés et aucune indication de comment les recrutements ont été effectués. Je n'ai as l'impression de voir des employés, mais des meubles immuables. Pas sûr que la génération suivante puisse facilement prendre la "relève" de ces positions.
L'accumulation de fonds en question est avant tout une niche fiscale… c'est pour ça qu'il s'est déclaré de nouveau candidat super tôt, pas vraiment pour des raisons politiques. Il gonfle son compte en banque sur le dos de ses électeurs vaches à lait et "optimise" son rendement plein pot.
Largement davantage qu'aux ROMs fournies par des constructeurs ayant des stratégies commerciales prédatrices, oui.
Could be interesting paired with BigScreen VR.
> there's not going to be the volleyball game in this version. 

Damn. No buy then. The first DoA Volleyball on the Xbox 1 was a fun little game to play, sort of a Virtua Tennis light with great visuals.
I won't be satisfied by the Surface until I see one running Microsoft Bob natively.
The only case scenario for which you do not need 6DoF is if you have a broken neck.
Je vous rappelle aussi au passage que la librairie [FigaroJS](https://theotix.github.io/figarojs/) existe

Et pour en ajouter une couche, il n'y a toujours aucun GPU capable d'encaisser de la réalité virtuelle AAA (résolution, fréquence d'affichage, scènes détaillées) sur le marché.

Le Kickstarter du Pimax 8KX est d'ailleurs rigolo, en annonçant qu'un SLI de 1080ti ne sera peut-être même pas suffisant et qu'il faudra attendre la prochaine génération de cartes graphiques pour en profiter.

Je vais jouer au vieu con aigri mais je vois que c'est une faute qui revient fréquemment dans tes messages, donc bon, autant prévenir un peu.
Oh boy. You *do* mind, especially for these kind of fast-paced games in which your head will be moving around a lot to tryband see the curves ahead, the competitors, and the likes. You just don't know you need 6DoF yet.

VR is *not* just a stereo3D extension.
Bwahaha

About the same. Pixel 2 has a 12Mpx camera, my phone has a 13Mpx one.
