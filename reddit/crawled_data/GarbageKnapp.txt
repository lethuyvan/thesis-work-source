i use winamp (with [this skin](https://victorbarac.deviantart.com/art/Muin-v2-157772387)), and get stuff from a combination of soulseek, [datpizz](http://datpizz.com/team-sesh-discography/), and sometimes random downloads from links to other sites. a lot of the time if im studying, playing games, or just need really quick access to a song or whatever ill use youtube/sc to listen to it, no biggie

try this tut, pretty similar concepts. youre not really gonna find any good premade vocal chops that will fit any beat like that. also check out dp beats / sy98 drum kit there is sum nice 808s there and they are free :D

anyone know the sample for the "wooooooooo" vocal that kinda sounds like sum wolf howl or something

i already check whosampled and its not the main attraktionz or the goblin song and i luv this sound so much

south asian food is amazing for a good diet. i would recommend proportioning more vegetables into dishes, cutting out the meat (or at least red meat) and substituting butter and oils for cleaner options like avocado oil or even water cooking

substituting chickpeas for rice in a lot of dishes also works surprisingly well and adds a lot more flavour than just white rice :)

>the way he tweets abt some things tho, i think he voted for trump

this probably the funniest shit ive read today. ive wondered this too. i think he has a very edgy misanthropic persona and might be atheist or even anti religion in his songs ("beheaded by hands of so called faith, for a chance to live in the sky") but idk i cant tell if hes really "anti-religion" or just like the weird dudes who hate islam but not other religions despite all them being pretty shitty (except neopaganism/wiccanism)

i think hes honestly pretty apolitical but has strong values and will support himself / his friends and family despite what might be the left-wing or right-wing or whatever the fuck approach 

and man its weird who cares at the end of the day he doesnt bother anyone with politics hes a fundamentally good dude who doesnt even participate in any shit thats harmful even online like most alt-right ppl, the only person he gets mad at are goofy people on twitter and shit

I have the Linnmon and after like 5-6 months, its actually starting to cave in at the edge a little for me.
Budget - $200~

Source - directly into pc, would prefer no need for amp but open to options

Requirements for Isolation - mainly home use, open to either closed or open back 

Preferred Type of Headphone - full sized preferred strongly

Preferred tonal balance - appreciate a "neutral" sound, but I'm looking for something a little more fun to listen to music with

Past headphones - been using the ATH-M50x, appreciate the neutral approach and good build quality

Preferred Music - lots of underground rap, and lo-fi/emo music (some examples: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKgt5qyZTsI), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1Gtmy_wcmI), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxxPkD-LBvY), [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88f6sJBWWkM)) 

What would you like to improve on from your set-up - just looking to upgrade to a sound that makes music a little more interesting,  i like the bassy boost on the ath m50s but not really looking for a super duper bassy headphone, something with better detail and nicer midtones would be good but im open to anything

Yes, I'm aware that you can see your own MMR. I was wondering if there's a way that other's can also see that exact number ever since they removed the option to display MMR on your profile.
corbin just sounds more grown up, spooky black sounds like a soundcloud meme rapper


its probably formatted artist name then prod by then song title but the song title got clipped in ss
It's probably a tongue-in-cheek marketing campaign. Hypnosis is very much a real thing that actually works but making you forget having seen a show is pretty far out in terms of what hypnosis can do. 
"Harnessed, was frightened, the world is so horrible, delicate thoughts and third count on my rolls"

his flow on this part of this song sounds so good
pretty sure useless and garbage are considered his "best" tapes

check out paidprogramming too he has a crazy diverse amount of beats in there
god i wish that were me
"and back again" is amazing

the intro to that album and "plent" are some of the nicest tracks he has put out imo
almost all of the carries are pretty straightforward and not super hard to play but i think these are good for teaching you specific things:

wraith king (even sven or ck i guess) - will teach you mana management 

sniper / drow  - will teach you positioning

naga / alchemist / lycan - a little more advanced but have relatively easy to manage micro which will teach you the basics

i would avoid heroes like meepo, gyro, brood, and morph

sorry for necroing this thread but just came up with an idea. isn't it possible that its just children pressing random letters in combination with predictive text? i mean its close enough to the keyboard, c u soon and bring her seem like they could be common phrases that parents would text each other etc

Wish he would've commented on Agony / Yellowman. Definitely the strongest parts of the album in my opinion.
probably just comes from being part of the first generation that grew the closest with technology, so you see the words often and might attach nostalgic feelings to them. they evoke some sort of emotion that it might not to people who arent usually surfing the net, etc
if you have a really strong offlane hero, i would suggest jungling. honestly this "never jungle" mindset only applies to heroes who depended on talon to jungle, but i still think heroes who can jungle freely and help lanes at the same time are good. most of the jungle summon heroes are amazing, ench, chen, np, enigma etc. if you don't have a strong offlane hero i would recommend asking "solo plz" in the chat, it works more often than youd think. other than that, if someone invades ur solo lane just go jungle.

i think instead of sb that game glimmer couldve been a better defensive item, and medallion a good defensive/offensive item. (np has a +8 armor talent and starts has okay armor, medallion is srsly underrated on him, and it synergizes with orchid which u get later on)

avp beats feel way more diverse in comparison to d&g though
just to try to keep it short..he doesn't conform to what is the accepted mainstream for "good" music or singing, he can be a little offkey, heavy on autotone, and severely emotional and dramatic and this can be offputting, coupled with beats that are also not very "mainstream" sounding and it can be weird on your first listen

bladee makes music that he feels sounds good, which is very different from ur average's person definiton of good

looking for links to the kick + bass (808?) that blank seems to use for a lot of songs, almost sounds like a dubstep kick or something to me but i still havent been able to come close and im not sure if its my eq'ing or im just not using a good enough sample


also pointers on where to find synths like these would b amazin
enfin leve, blackmerle, 424 on fairfax, merch from underground artists such as teamsesh or dark world
nice! did u use the synths from the cs pack?
hot take : if you’re really worried about paypal stealing your SSN, you can ask the IRS for an EIN number which does pretty much the same thing

i feel like most ppl here arent actually scared about their security but rather just looking for things to complain about
fl is the most popular, but honestly daws dont really matter blud, the most u really need to care about is good packs and synths and even then its better to be creative

not sure about kith releases, but you should look on grailed

usually different price cuts apply to different products. you have to remember that the reason stores have sales is not to be nice but to move product. if a product is in high demand it wont get a big cut, usually the stuff you will see the big sales on in products that have been sitting for a while

personally i think bombers work better, but my outfit is more tech and 90% black so it depends on ur personal style. hm and asos or any fast fashion brand have fine bombers for under 100, after all its mostly just nylon and cotton and its hard to screw that up. if you're willing to spend like 50~ dollars more you can probably find a really nice bomber from damir doma's silent or something designer like that if youre into that aesthetic

good samples -> distortion / stereo shaper

luv this song, been experimenting making dark guitar stuff for a couple of years

easiest is to do sampling of old emo songs, another place u can find loops is freesounds, just look up stuff like ambient / dark guitar loops etc

u can also try ur hand at doing it using kontakt and guitar packs such as session guitarist - strummed guitar 

and lastly u can just make it urself its not that hard to just strum chords
i have long hair and its a bit of a struggle butwhat is do is just try to keep it tucked under the ski mask then pull the ski mask halfway down then put the beanie on top to make sure theres no fluff and frizz going everywhere and to make sure the ski mask also doesnt slide down my face

honestly my suggestion just start listening to as much music as you feel like, /r/ListenToThis (is a good start) 

if ur parents will let u buy a nice pair of headphones,

sounds like youve listened to barely the tip of the iceberg and you think you're experienced it all. lurk soundcloud, follow producers who make crazy shit and just go through the endless resource of creativity on there


some other suggestions, pick up making music, producing, playing an instrument, singing or anything, or really any hobby that requires you to work your mind or body

I think what he's saying is that the .zip files Bones uploads of his music are 320 exports direct from whatever DAW he uses, and then are uploaded to soundcloud. they are not uploaded to soundcloud, then placed in a zip file then made available for download
It could definitely be affecting your aim, inconsistent sensors and delays are definitely a problem with cheap mice. In my opinion the best mouse for the value, (at least for FPS games) is a Sensei Raw Pro. You can find some on eBay for like $20-$25 easily. In my opinion, the Sensei is a lot nicer to hold and use than other mice like the G Pro or the Deathadder, but as always, you can do your research on what you like and dont like.

I'm not policing his attractions at all, I'm just saying that fetishizing a race doesn't make you any better than the people who exclude dating one race or races, 

using this logic, you could argue that what the guy said to OP is acceptable because "the guy likes what he likes"

it's explained much better by comments above,

Same information. It's just the Daily Mail is calling him what he is, both articles show that he wanted also kill "blacks, Arabs and homosexuals." You could come to the same conclusion from reading the BBC article, but it's funner to argue semantics on reddit, no?
Great guide, just one question. Say your team wants to run a 2-2-2 setup; which position would you put Sombra in, DPS or support?
They do have my basic respect. Trying to equate LGBT-only spaces to discrimination is not a good comparison.
at this point, honestly nothing. the "bi" label was created when it wasnt that common to see genders outside the gender binary even in the lgbt community, and saying pan is just a way to adapt to the times.

but literally, bi = two genders, pan = all genders (everything from agender to non-binary and inbetween)
I think allies are important but I think they need to understand if people want certain spaces to be LGBT-only or something like that. You don't exactly deserve a gold star for just giving me basic respect.

1. using primer and moisturizing go a long way in making your foundation coverage amazing, also applying concealer b4 foundation to hide certain facial hair/blemishes is one of my favorite uses, i also i wish i wouldve discovered the more "indie" makeup channels because as a POC lets be honest 95% of the bigger makeup channels are just white cis women doing nearly the same boring look over and over, also also wish i knew about el.f. and colourpop way sooner

2. i was initially afraid of going into makeup stores and asking the employees for recommendations/help but there really isn't a reason to, i felt like i didn't "pass" well enough to go out but honestly they dont care if youre cis, trans, nb, whatever, they just wanna do their best to help everyone equally

3. eyeliner, man putting that on is such a struggle, also applying good but not overdone contour can be hard

4. ive just wanted a simple-ish look, just basic coverage and countour/highlight here and there, but if there is a specific look i want i can usually figure it out after watching a video

Hello, I keep hearing that even though the Sony MDR V6 are good for the price, there's better options but I never see any specific recommendations from there

Budget - Around $50 on eBay (don't care if used) 

Source - Desktop, no amp

Requirements for Isolation - Some, home use only

Will you be using these Headphones in Public? - No

Preferred Type of Headphone - Circumaural, closed-back

Preferred tonal balance - Neutral, looking for a balanced "monitoring" sound, mainly going to be used for producing/gaming

Past headphones - Gemini HSR-1000, these headphones really provided everything that I needed, and I would buy them again but the places I can find that sell them are selling them for 300+ when I originally paid like $40 on Amazon

Preferred Music - Rap, emo, lo-fi, PC music

What would you like to improve on from your set-up - Most important to me is that they have a neutral sound, and are built to be somewhat durable, it would also be a big plus to have a removable wire
also the flacko - nvrmatching vid plz???? thnx

what happened to ur instrumentals bro
Basically how this works is that there's a company you can pay $40 to put anything on Spotify for you (I believe it's called Tunecore) and they won't really check copyright especially for small artists like Bones, so people keep doing it and doing it for new Bones stuff because they know it's hot rn and they can make a couple bucks
still have hope for full version of buzz..... hopefully on next lean album with the orangina song but thats at least 2018 release lol..fuckkkkkk

You should try being mindful of trans and nb people who really appreciate when people don't jump to conclusions based on appearance, it's such a sweet reminder that people care about you.  (:

I don't get the outrage, if cis people are excluded from trans/nb topics, they whine. People try to include them and they whine. The world doesn't revolve around being cis and when people ask you stuff like this it's to be respectful, if you identify as the gender you were born as just say your pronouns, it's not a jab at you looking, god-forbid, like a trans person...
Yea, don't see the big deal. OP's friend was trying to be as respectful of OP as possible

okay? they both make "sad rap" music but you can tell a whitearmor song from a karman one, what does being in dg have to do with anything
you can be in the same genre without having the exact same fucking style lmfao

compare clipping and death grips, karman and whitearmor, or literally any artists that work in small but good music cliques and you can see that they clearly have their own personal style and arent a rip of other artists

warlord for the bangers and vibers eversince for the feelings ):
Yeah, thank you, just wanna clear up misconceptions that I'm out to bite Greaf's style effortlessly, I know how Bones and everyone else feels about people like that and I'm trying to avoid it as much as I can
I don't think we're understanding each other here, I want to learn Greaf's style not to emulate Greaf later in the future, but see how that knowledge can go into making my own style, like, if those genres influenced Greaf and that's his sound, if my influences are Greaf, drip-133, catsoup etc, how will my sound be like? you feel, i dont want to copy his sound to make similar stuff, i want to learn, i'm having a hard time making my *own* style because i don't have any experience making *any* style
ok....
what thaiboy lacks in bars he makes up for in beautiful hair
madeofglass is a fkn anthem, one of thaiboy's best tracks prob
yea op seems to be overlooking the fact that thaiboy speaks 3 languages and english is the most recent
yes,  i understand, which is why i haven't posted my music here and im not planning on it, ive produced a lot more than I've posted anywhere to avoid that exactly, I'm not trying to replicate to ride the wave, i understand how much everyone in teamsesh hates that kind of attitude 

im taking it from the perspective of say, greaf, whose inspiration are like hardcore and post punk and stuff like that,  he had to understand what went into that kind of music to make what he's making now, which is what I'm trying to do by understanding different production proccesses

if it was something broad like hardstyle or house music I'd try to branch off on my own, but the thing is that i feel each sesh producer hits a very niche genre with their individual styles, and i wanna reach that level before pushing the boundaries myself
Yeah, usually I'll start looking at other styles, see other people's fits more, and start blending ideas here and there and seeing if its what i like and what is more or less unique to me, or if all else fails, sell a good portion of my wardrobe to pursue a different style

There is other places in the world other than the U.S. believe it or not
I saw Greaf at a grocery store in Australia yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
he boot too big for he gotdamn feet

its so cute that you thought this comment was even halfway clever lol
"Fuck off goddamn retard."

good discussion you brought some great points to the table ive really changed my opinion
Of course they do, and it's a good thing they do, but for ppl into fashion and especially fashion companies it's important that cultures aren't treated like accessories and are "interacted with on more than an aesthetic level" 

"Cherry-picking cultural elements, whether dance moves or print designs, without engaging with their creators or the cultures that gave rise to them not only creates the potential for misappropriation; it also misses an opportunity for art to perpetuate real, world-changing progress."
