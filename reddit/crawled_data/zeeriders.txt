But it somewhat accounts for the pity rule Ryan informed us about.
Same, mine has begun to lag as well on iOS 11.
He’s not dead guys.
Happens in 500+ sd. They all go into the poison and all get 1st.
99 good players you won’t have to face.
Also could be the fact that most of your brawlers are maxed and you play with other people that are maxed.
This is very wrong and easily exploitable. Definitely, coordinated. However, it would be difficult for SC to fix as wait times would be even longer. After global, if this is not fixed... then it’s a bigger problem.

Damn the cap is 40. I think you get that around 7:30 mins. I got 39 from 7:19.
Happened to me since 11.0
Yeah sc probably saw this thread, they changed his name to "max brawler" lol. He said he was able to make a long name with a keyboard shortcut.
Yeah lol
Take it to a certified Apple Service Provider, if there are no Apple Stores. There are probably some nearby.

How long do you spend on Clash Royale per day? /u/B-Rad /u/CMcHugh7 /u/ahcraaaap
False.
Playing with brawlers 300+ or sometimes even 250+, it can be very common to find top 200, and even top 100 players.
Now he’s a cop that protects the streets.
So
But this is a moba, and unlike other sc games, could easily be incorporated on Apple TV.
Yeah, I agree. It's not really that important though, as it takes >1 hour to get past 70 trophies.
You can see the stats with your tag in discord. However, harmiox's bot is down.

Yes you just need to have zero store credit.
I have the same as well. 73/74 and no sparky.
You could change regions on your US Apple ID to Canada and re-download the app on that account. Switch your account back to US and you should be able to buy gems with your credit card.
Agreed, some people have a lot of brawlers and can get to 1k-1.5k easily and get into a top 200 band with out decent skill.

Source: myself, I lead a feeder to a top 50 band. (We are in the top 250)
I'll play, thanks for the tourneys!

3 spots in UpRising! Get 'em while they're hot! 🔥
I think Touchmint made an app for this
It is actually with film labour laws in countries such as US, where if you are under 16, you can only work for a few hours before a break must be given.
Which YouTuber will steal this first? Will it be TrendingOnYourPhone?
Mortar>Archers>Knight>Spirit>Rocket
I'm not even surprised. Good job /u/pompeyo4 !
4237 Current, 4462 PB
Nice clan :)
Could be a restrictions setting on iOS?
Good luck burning upwards of 3.5k pictures. 😂
Sorry my phone was lagging. 😂
It started in the middle of the night for me by the time I woke up >5 hours after it started my clan was already long done the chest.
LOL 
My clan before I woke up, which was 5 hours after it started. They probably got it a while before though. :(
I asked my clan mates and it started with a few people and then suddenly everyone got affected.
I've got 6 Inferno Dragons :(
It's because of the new matchmaking system that matches you with people with similar Personal Bests (PB) as you.
Over leveling is useless though.
Yeah I have the same situation (except with horde) it think it's necessary to push higher.
I currently use the same deck with minions instead of princess. I can often beat lavahound and lavaloon decks.
What about zap not having stun and then having 1 sec stun, now being .5 secs?
Barrel, Mirror, Skarmy, Minion Horde, Rocket, Gang, Log, Furnace

Very solid deck
I remember him as the guy who won all of Phonecats daily tournaments. And was one of the first F2P to get to legendary (as a lvl 6). Has always been the most akilled in the game, imo.

Minion horde spawns 6 minons...
There is chip as the damage occurrs every second so skeletons can hit the tower in that time.
Beat him on my first try not hard imo.
Ok I will make a basic guide.
Ok will try to post it sometime next week.
Sorry I'm on mobile and I didn't click on the link. My apologies.
Let me know if there is a certain deck that you are having trouble with. 
Yes but only if you are willing to practice.

Deck: Hog, Ice Wiz, Log, Zap, Rocket, Skarmy, Minion Horde, Inferno tower. 

Got me to 4k with 10/7/4/1

If you want I can post a guide but I am busy right now and it will probably be done in about a week. Good luck in the arena.
Can confirm. Very rare above 4k.
Who's Instagram is this on?
Yes you can. My friend did it and was able to do it without losing the Android software.
I think they will increase the cost to 3. 
Yep. It's a known glitch that happens every now and then.
You send hog with m horde or ice wiz if they have fireball and use skarmy, ice wiz for defense. You want to cycle rockets and defend for the 1-0 victory.
Do you do live streams? If so, on which platform?
If you like hog rocket try this deck:
Hog, Rocket, I tower, Skarmy, m horde, log (or fire spirits), ice wiz (or musket), zap

Got me to 4K with 10/7/4/1.5
Yep. Is pretty bad.
Nice one.
Sorry forgot inferno tower and ice wiz
Try this deck:
-Hog
-Minion Horde
-Skarmy
-Zap
-Log
-Rocket
Got me above 4K as a lvl 10.
Awhile ago, everyone above 3000 got reset down to 3000. That is why that player has legendary trophies.
Try to push in the clan chest off week. You will face less people that are overleveled and most people will go back to their original trophy range. Ex: last week (clan chest off week) I pushed from 3700 to 4100 pretty easily.
Gems are 300
I climbed from 2500 to 3691 with this deck: Hog-7, Rocket-7, Skarmy-3, M. Horde-10, Zap-10, Inferno Tower-7, Ice wiz-1, Log-1. I am currently lvl 10 but was lvl 9 when I got to legendary (about 1 month ago) and m horde and zap were lvl 9.
What trophy range have you been using this deck at on the ladder?
Crown Tower 9, Hog-7, Skarmy-3, Rocket-6, Tesla-9, Zap-9, Minion Horde-9, Ice Wiz-1, Log-1
This happened to anyone who opened the app within a few hours of the balance change. To fix this delete and reinstall the app. 
What is this?
Cool low arena tho push with em mate.

Anyone have a gift card they don't want. I'll host a tournament. I know pcats!
If u see again the. Blame away.
And don't blame could be irl friends and quick decision/ laziness.
Could be alt
Yeah I've climbed over 2800 with hog freeze it sucks I faced a lvl
11 with 7 epics! Beat the little gemmer 😒
If it's rarer than it should be a little better. It needs another buff for sure. Not sure what tho. Excellent points!

Hey guys maybe sore emote sometimes I feel bad after 20 sec 3 crown lol
Lvl 7 legend maybe? Or 8?
Very cool keep it up. Discord?
Plz do freeze, zap, hog, gobs vid. Supercell may like if u know what I mean :) 
I have lvl 6 fireball so it works sometimes when I'm low and tilted :).
Going to bed now can't watch :(.

Okay lol just quick look I was busy
One word: fireball.
I'm at 2800 is that okay?
Your face looks to big on your stream. Maybe zoom out.
Edit: Yeah it's a problem with the app works fine on from the Reddit site.
Makes me feel good, considering I'm a lvl 8 siting at 2800.
Seems kind of like the ice wizard, but I only had a quick look at the post.
Wrong link says "page not found".
It's your connection. Could be you or the server. Has happened to me before.
That also explains why you weren't able to join the clan at first.
Hey I know this isn't the recruiting sub, but my clan family has a bunch of clans at 49/50 and we request/donate a lot. We are the 420 family. Feeders are 420.5, 421, 421.5, etc all the way down to 424.5 if anyone wants.
Use bomb tower instead of baby dragon and arrows instead of barbs and you can easily get to 2500. I'm at 2756 but I'm hovering around 2600-2850. I hope to get to legends. Credit to denz11 on the deck though.
Well my clan is kept at 49/50. It can be a struggle for some to reach the limit every day.
To fix drts maybe divide the epic total by 8, the rare total 10, the common total by 12, and the legendary total by 6. I think this would be fairer.
I got baby dragon in my shop today.
I'll try it.
[deleted] double comment. My bad sorry had bad connection. :(
Wow those are the best. Free donations.
Works very well especially with my arrows and stab gobs being lvl 9. Will try to push to legends today. (Trophy count: 2655)

Edit: Thanks for the awesome deck. Sitting at 2829 now. Only lost once because of a mistake at the end.
Happens often in my clan family. We often get matched with people in other feeders.
I would suggest a tesla instead of elixir collector because it can be very useful to have at least one building in your deck.
If you look at the image, you can see that he had 2584 trophies in both battles although the first one says he lost 30. This means the battles did happen simultaneouslay. 
When is ROL 2.0?
Are you going to stream on twitch?

25 very impatient though; could have used less.
Lvl 8 F2P Trophy record: 2527

Edit: Have a F2P lvl 8 clan mate who is almost at 3000 using a mortar deck. His pb is over 2.8k.
If you look at the #1 player's profile, it says favourite card mini pekka. HKeSports is known to create "fake" decks that they don't actually use. I suspect this one is fake. However it may work.
**8PCVOQ9J**
Same here.
Send one character. Then the next 5 things you send will be big. (Unless someone sends a message in between)
Idk but whoever commented before me is shadow banned.
I found 4 today in crystal III. Btw I'm a th 9.
Yeah same here.
Yes I know one. Contact the username: "Strongdong" for info.

P.S. Strongdong is not me, just a player who came to my alliance offering all rewards for the gifting event.
Thanks for the information. However, my alliance mate is using a 3 star star lord. By the way, I have beaten the Realm so I know Jugg is annoying, but I did it with Strange so I wanted some new advice.
Yeah I saw your vid, but why do you hate Magik.
Yeah same happened to me, I thought my wifi was bad until the maintenance message too.
Daily crystals used to award 4 stars.
But I also want Star lord.
Okay, I think I will try it, I'm on quest 2 of insanity right now.
Around how much health do the opponents have in chapter 4 of coulsons quests?
Yesterday I got a 4 star daredevil and new magneto and today I beat the realm!
I do the same except I just barch. I get elixir and gold as well. Also I have never been attacked since the update (other than trophy droppers).
I agree. I get 6m gold and elixir and 20k de from 2 hours of barch (sniping) without boosting at 1100 to 1300 trophy range.
That's my theory as well.
I duped mine yesterday from a 4 star shard crystal.
Brandon is level 315 but still impressive! [His YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCttQf1sGLn5wZaaqoHam1-w)
