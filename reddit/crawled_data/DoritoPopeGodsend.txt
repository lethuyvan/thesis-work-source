Why am I getting low fps on ALL graphics settings?

About to just uninstall and give up for good.

Fresh windows install, checked oc on gpu, checked Nvidia power settings, disabled game bar, checked monitors set refresh rate, fresh league install, etc. I've done everything I can think of.

I love "Stairway to Alabama". Best song ever.
I didn't sign up to this site to be lectured by a mere non mortal. Back to your hard drive, foul beast.
I've researched them fairly alot and, at least for ge8 owners, the larger majority truly do believe that it nearly eliminates all initial turn in understeer/plow, as well as actually makes the overall road feel more comfortable.

However, it is still lowering the car rough 1.5 inch. So road feel is probably improved upon compliance on rougher highways/overall car feel, vs general "road feel" relating hitting pot holes/driving down shitty beat town roads.

If you don't live in a major heavy traffic urban area, I'd highly recommend the springs. Having said that, I haven't ordered mine yet so take everything I say with a grain of salt.

Agreed. Stacked up to cars of the same year in higher price brackets/classes, the fit isn't going to be able to trade blows in terms of comfort/refined characteristics. That's not saying anything about the car is subjectively bad at all really.

As far as ride quality, which at least is something I would even remotely be bothered enough to issues complaints on, seems to be rectified by picking up a set of Swift springs and having them installed. You'll just have to deal with the drop, which looks awesome but will make you be more cautious regarding potholes/driveway entrances.
For sure. Easy to laugh about this stuff until you realize two actual people are going to grow up and be damaged permanently by her selfish actions.

Gotta admit she's hot though.
I've surfed /b/ enough to know a troll when I see one. The edit is just too good.
Underrated comment 
I had a (what I presumed to be) schizophrenic hippie white guy with dreads that couch surfed at our place for 100% free for nearly 3 months.

When we ended up moving, the day we were loading the uhaul, he just layed on the couch and stared at the wall the entire time. We weren't sure if he had another place to go or what.

So we do all the work and get moved into our new place, and one of our roommates comes back to the new house with the same dude asking "hey do you think it's ok if he crashes with us for just a little bit more? He doesn't have anywhere else to go." So the house agrees. He lives with us for free in the new place for nearly 2 months until he asked my roommate for a cig and some weed for free at 5 am. Then he kicked him out.

He also wore down the joysticks on my PS3 controller from playing like 40 hours of Bayonetta. Still pissed about that.

But can you use your frying pan..... As a drying pan??????


If you look at guru3ds ryzen review, he explicitly mentions at the end how he feels quad cores are feeling obsolete when it comes to general windows use. It's considerably snaplier on the r5 platform.

Again. Intel will mainly get you better optimization and more fps. That is the only benefit.
He's.... A Jewphin.
Bruh I just died on the toilet at 8 in the morning.
Agreed. If gaming is literally your only concern this is the way to go.

Ryzen would offer close gaming performance but would offer much better windows/multi tasking usability. But factor in the insane cost of higher clocked ddr4 and that adds more on to the cost as well.
Lol dude your money is gone. Move past it.
Damn that sucks man. If there is some way to be found I'd be happy to help. Clean everything up and see if it's still operable. Best of luck and stay safe.
I don't know if it helps or not, but I have a spare ryzen 3, a amd 1100t CPU and matching Asus am3+ Mobo with 12 gigs of RAM, and some spare cables/pieces I could send your way if everythings a complete loss

For sure my sc 1070 can mostly do 2560x1080 at 75 fps constantly but even that's a stretch 
I feel like making the jump to 1440p would require a 1080 or more for constant 60-75 fps
Bruh I was happy with my 75hz lol. Welcome regardless!

-No point in upgrading to disks, Itd be hard for anyone to use the discs up to their potential over drums.

-the sprintex with the tune will maybe net you 140 whp. If it's a good tune.

-dont waste time on the short ram intake. The stock air box's design is the go to intake outside of doing a full cold air intake install.
Eh gonna be hard to find a set of springs at stock height. I'd just stick with OEM at that point.
General consensus on fit forums is that Swift springs are the best direct swap springs, should lower about 1.5 inches and retain (or most say improve) stock ride quality.

Be wary of cheap coilovers/springs. And be wary of dropping too far down without adjusting camber.
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OP delivers 

Currently have a R5 1600 clocked at 3.8, 8 gigs of 2933 mhz ram, and nthe EVGA SC 1070.

with the gpu oc'd by Guru 3ds recommend increments, I have gotten the following benchmarks from the last few days:

Arkham Knight (4k, high, AA on,) 60 fps with vsync (intermittent fps drop with Nvidia special fx on, but it's a broken port regardless)

Project cars 2: 1080p high/very high with SSAA on low: 55-60 fps on full online lobbies of 20+ cars

GtaV 2560x1080 (ultrawide): very high, grass on high, msaa x4, near constant 75fps minus night/day transitions

Rocket league: lol c'mon

I would say any brand new title is going to need all AA besides fxaa off, but can hit 50-60 fps on high settings, but any title not within 1-2 years of age is near ultra 4k present range.

I'm sure with a 1080 or ti you could hit all settings ultra at 4k, but I really personally at least find the graphic quality difference between high and very high is negligible.

If you can find a 1070 for MSRP is, I'd say make the jump. 

Went from Nvidia 860m>Nvidia 960>amd 480 8 gig>evga 1060 SSC> EVGA 1070 sc

For sure I used to own the blue one. Was my first serious guitar. I ended up getting rid of it when I got a bit bored and stopped playing for 2/3 years. Kind of wish I had it back. Was a super solid guitar.

The c-1 standard has the same scale length so when I picked it up and felt it out, it was crazy how my brain was like "ahhh yes I remember this" and immediately went back to business on it as if no time had passed at all.
It's a c-1 "standard" (not to be confused with the c-1 classic)

I would agree that job wise there aren't alot of long term career positions that I'd really consider at all, however as a soon to be returning college student, I do like the area for lower cost of living without a large amount of crime. It seems like the only true good career options are the Arsenal and management around here. Forget anything involving graphic design, computer science, etc.

But maybe lower cost of living goes hand in hand with people not willing to try as hard. They know it requires less so they put in less effort, which is great for families and people sick of working 60 hour work weeks, but bad for younger people that like to be lazy.

There's nothing wrong with being lazy now and then, it's when it starts to become a habit that it becomes a problem.
Yeah I feel like the QC crowd is young and hip, but they aren't coastal hipsters. You'll only find giant diverse sushi options in major metropolitan areas (LA, NY, etc.)

Having said that, the sushi place in the mall isn't bad.

Unfortunately, younger people just end up eating re-heated frozen meals like Applebee's, etc.

I always try to go to other places like Sippis, Capriottis, Charlie's Subs, Central Standard, etc.
For sure. Wish we could more shows/people like the Picador in IA city used to get.
You're telling me. Our apartment complex "fixed" the parking lot here by essentially repainting it... 

Don't even get me started on 53rd. Feel bad for anyone with any lowered sport coupe.
Dude you think that's bad? The Chick Fil A on 53rd REGULARLY has so much traffic it backs up into 53rd. They send out a cop to play traffic cop for at least an hour or two 1-2x a week.

Foods good but for the life of me I don't see the appeal worth waiting that long for.
Hell yeah, I knew it.

Idk about Blockbuster , but here we have Family Video and it's actually fucking awesome to go there. 4k Blu rays take up so much data to stream and they rent out almost every new move in 4k. Let alone renting 1 player PS4 games you wouldn't really want to buy otherwise.

Tack on decent priced candy at the end and that's how they fucking hooked me good. Apparently the company is doing really really well too.

Smh 
Not all games have a pro patch that makes them run at 4k. In the article it said that if the system notices it isn't running a 4k native res that it would use the SS option.

So having that SS option on a PS4 game with no patch that would otherwise play at 1080p would be an improvement, no?
Hmmm... So is the super sample option a choosable one or will it just be implemented automatically?

This would be good for alot of game that DONT have a pspro patch option, it would essentially allow a anti aliasing option that the standard PS4 couldn't offer. But will it not work at all if the tv is a 4k tv instead of a 1080p tv???

Lol is that it? That's the great troll response? Why even bother with making a profile to troll if you're garbage at it? Do you really think normal people get worked up over strangers on the internet?

That's why you're an incel. You're not normal. You're a societal failure. So you come on here and try to shit post and it's not even funny or successful. Just a half baked effort at being edgy. There's not one funny or successful troll in your entire post history. "Hurr Durr your husband is ugly". "Samsung is shit m8 LOL"

Riveting success, dawg.
Shit troll is shit. Go back and practice on /b/ and try not to let everyone see all your shit posting in your profile. It's a dead giveaway.

Had some guy here in the quad cities last night in a VW station wagon apologize and say "I hate to ask I really do but do you have any spare money or change I could use for gas?"

I had like $1 I gave him but when I saw him actually walk up and try to count out the change for gas, I just told the attendant to put $10 on his pump from my card.

Don't know if the guy really needed it or not, but he just seemed down on his luck. Regardless if he needed it or not, I hope it helped in some way and that he doesn't do it to tons of people.

Giving up $10 to help some guy get home doesn't seem like a big deal to me. People just get bad circumstances sometimes.

My grandpa told me when I was helping sell some stuff from our house right before we sold it after his retirement. Him and my grandma raised my sister and I, their grandkids, and my grandma passed away when I was 16. She didn't have life insurance so he had to pay her funeral costs out of pocket... On top of that before she passed away she got identity fraud from buying too many things on QVC.

My grandpa told me that to add on that, he ended up loaning a co worker who "really needed the money" nearly a $5000 co sign for something and, of course, she never paid the bill, making him do the payments so his credit wouldn't get ruined. He always does things like that for people (helps with gas, fill their tank, whatever) because he's too damn nice.

I don't know how he made it through literally all of those things happening at the same time. But damn do I love him and appreciate everything he did for us.

Nice to see him happy now snowbirding to flordia with his new girlfriend. Deserves every bit of it.
I don't know what that is but it sounds appropriately cool looking. So good one.

I'm not responding to this 50 times so I'll just copy and paste:

had asked how much it cost, and I was told $4,000, so I was kind of saving up my forced-call money, thinking, â€˜At the end of this movie Iâ€™m gonna buy that baby... And itâ€™s gonna be my memento that I give to myself.â€™ I got a few zeroes wrong --Â it was aÂ $40,000Â guitar, and it was also a museum piece, so I never would have been able to buy itâ€¦Â 

So there is no confirmed source about who, what, or where appraised that guitar at that value. But if you do any basic research about guitars, you'd find it's not hard to believe its worth considerably more than $40,000.

I am not a fucking master luthiere with a PhD in music instrument value and history. I'm a 26 year old eating leftover pie and smoking weed that happens to know a small amount about guitars.
For anyone interested, the guitar Jimi Hendrix played at wood stock was purchased by a Microsoft employee for 2 MILLION dollars and sits in a vault he owns.

I get the difference between an artist playing the guitar in terms of value vs just a guitar from history, put 100+ year old anything is hardly disposable.
I did not put a price on it, I am reposting the said price from the 500 articles posted about the incident.

Takes 2 seconds to Google it.
I believe they said it was only insured for the "purchase price" which was the amount Martin was reimbursed.

60s fenders/Les Paul's even ASSOSCIATED in ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM with Led Zeppelin/Jimi Hendrix sell for near that.

This is a 100+ year old acoustic guitar from the END ALL BE ALL KING of consumer bought acoustic guitars.

It was probably worth more than $40,000.
Lol it was a $40,000 (estimated) piece of American music and luthiere history dating back over 100 years. It's like calling the Constitution "just a piece of paper".

A century old wooden instrument that STILL WORKS is not "just a guitar". It is the literal definition of priceless.
Holy shit

What would be a good point of entry for a job like that? I have 6+ years of retail/customer service and have done a great job of incrementally moving up the ladder between jobs.

Should I seek out a degree or is there a way I can market myself without one? I don't mind getting one but I prefer avoiding debt as much as possible.

Also agree. The 1080ti is close to the highest end card you could get. No reason to buy it.
Yup.
Nothing surprises people more than sitting down in Abercrombie jeans and a supreme shirt and mentioning how Love Hina is underrated.

Great work. He did a very solid job.
What in the fuck...
Eh I'm no Trump fan by any means, but I think you're stretching things a bit...
I wouldn't say he went to the gay community as support at all.

It was a carefully worded response written by a team of PR people that knew they were probably screwed regardless and took an open gamble to garner public  support/pity. It might carry an amount of honesty about being gay, but that wasn't an unknown thing by most people.

It obviously backfired. They probably assumed this would be a Mel Gibson/Paula Deen "do-over" type of thing where he'd apologize, cry on TV, disappear for awhile, then come back in 5 years. Obviously now we know that's not the case. This will likely ruin him permanently.
100%. That part where he mentions that if something or someone could cause Martin Lawrence to run half naked through the streets basically out of his mind, that it's some crazy fucked up shit in entertainment that isn't openly talked about but is well acknowledged by everyone who works in it.

Sounds like you both had your own issues. He shouldn't have been so pathetic about his mom and your relationship was weakend enough that an argument about getting chicken caused a divorce. It sounds like you're leaving other details out that obviously led up to you being so easily frustrated with each other. 

Go get some counseling and move on with your life.
The same reason Kevin Spacey will still have a career in the future: 

You go on TV, apologize nationally, disappear for 6 years, then start working again.

Worked for Paula Deen, Mel Gibson, etc. They just bide some time while sitting on their millions.

Confirmed they are Nike Air Force 1 Hi Retro QS in Summit White and Team Red, one of the reissues of the original 6 AF1 colors. It is considered by some a "special edition" shoe but it doesn't seem that highly sought after online. Having said that I grew up here in the Midwest as a Bulls fan and having some white and red nike gear is always worth having.
On the tag it does say summit white
No I mean just keep. Are they any certain edition or is there a number on the shoe tag I can search to find out?
Uh doesn't the AWD add a good portion of weight itself? I would agree any v6 sedan would be heavier for sure.
I've owned 2 3000gts, both a base 91 and a 96 VR4, and I was always impressed how Mitsubishi made that 6g72 (?) Dohc 3.0 v6 make 222 bhp IN 1991.

Weren't most v-8 fox bodies making like 240 bhp?? And that was just the base trim 3000gt. The VR4 made 300 whp (320 by 99) in 1991. Add in AWD, AWS, active aero, active exhaust, and that sick ass A/C screen and you have why it's one of my all time favorite cars, maintenance aside.
I'm guessing they do the same that alot of DSM/3000gt guys do and just throw aftermarket boost controller/cheap intake on and crank up the boost?
Yeah and if you buy a NA Subaru engine you can basically convince yourself it's a brz/frs/86 ;) 

I mean I know I would.
Driver error. I drove a fwd del sol with better quality all seasons and no traction control/abs through 2 Iowa winters with a 35 minute backroad commute into town and never crashed.

In fact the only time I think I've ever wrecked was stupidly going into a tight left turn in neutral with cold all seasons on a cold rainy day and basically spun 180 degrees and tapped my bumped on a guard rail. Not sure why I did something so dumb.

Which brings me around to this: we all have lapses on judgement and screwup. We're human. So take that into consideration too.
Most OLDER daily cars has that amount. Newer stock v6s put out at least 300hp anymore. And by newer I mean anything from almost 8 years ago on.

And I'd say the second part is a fair argument and I'd agree with it.
I'm sorry but just because a car has 40 hp more than most vehicles and has AWD doesn't mean it's a goddamn race car. And don't basis it on Subarus past of rally racing. The REAL Subaru race cars (look up the video of Tommy M. Driving with Tsuchiya) cost near a million dollars.
Are imprezas awd and turbo as well? Wow I had no idea the entry on them was anywhere under 25k. That's not a bad price.
Timing belts are forgivable though. They aren't that uncommon.
A new Subaru is under $20,000? Which one?
Dude I drive a Honda fit. The only Evo I own is on video games.

Personally speaking I prefer the VR4 over the Evo though. Just personal bias.
Yeah I hear the auto trans (not sure if they're all cvts) on Altimas and Maximas are just prone to disaster. Was the reason I didn't end up getting an Altima Coupe .
For those of you that down voted me, I'm not here to argue or talk shit because I love everything from shitty Isuzu pickups to Zondas. 

What is the average maintenance cost of a Subaru vs a Honda or Toyota and which has the higher reliability rating?

Also yes yes I know smiles per gallon. I'm not arguing on basis of a fun car I'm arguing on basis of having ONE SINGLE CAR you rely on day in and day out 100% of the time. 

I hate coming off as an asshole because I'm new to Reddit but I have a hard time seeing how a wrx would be a good pick for that. I've never owned one but all I hear about is how much they cost to maintain. Maybe one of you can enlighten me otherwise?
At least most Mitsubishi's are super reliable as long as you do the 60k services (mostly oil pump and timing belt/pulleys).

Not that their auto transmissions are much better.
Name one other car that is Japanese and has as many reliability issues as Subaru?

Exactly. There's none. It's a Japanese car with all of the headaches of a German one. 

I'm not saying they aren't awesome. I'm saying they suck to own unless you NEED to pony up and use awd all the time in heavy snow states.
Why does it remind me of a Chrysler 300? Ugh Honda what are you doing???????
Easy there, Jay Cutler. You'll get your chance to be just as equally hated.
Unfortunate this happens. Makes it hard to play through a whole race. 
God fuck you megan
Cool thanks!
Shit I just saw this shirt today next to another one that said "tokyo burger run '86" at tj Maxx... My gf works there and always shows me random stuff like this.
I did the same thing with my doctor.

Then I remembered I'm 26 and I've had him since I was about 9, and that he has 30 years of medical experience and I have 20 minutes of panicd Google search experience.

Take my advice on this one: trust your doctor . And go find something to do so you're not sitting and worrying all the time.
Can anyone comment on needing more RAM for higher than 1080p resoultions? (Mostly 4k)
Thanks! MSRP was $125 and I got them for about $32
Yeah I never would've guessed a cold weather skate shoe would be comparable.
New to the shoe game. Didn't realize people on here took things so harshly..... Makes it seem harder to get into.
Really wasn't aware of what timbs were. Thanks for the input guys.
I'm feeling the cum white ones.
It's a fit sport that has 29,000 miles on it owned by my 2 grandparents, sold to me for $7000. For the price I got it for, I'd really like to keep it in the neat new condition it's in. Because it's barely broken in yet. I know it's not a type r or a rx7, but I bought it to be a good street car and I've never had a "new" car before.

Trust me if I had enough money I'd be dailying my VR4, but I don't have the spare funds to fix it right now.
Didn't know they're so pricey.. shit
Next day shipping
Feasible to got Vossens?
It's only one wheel... But honestly no. Was waiting to go aftermarket.
No theyre definitely alloys then.
Not sure other than knowing they're a 16 inch, 1 inch bigger than the base trim
Loved that show. Favorite scene is when Andy is arguing with Jim and he yells "what are you, high??" And Jim just blankly smiles back at him with no verbal response.

Pretty sure AS hasn't aired it in forever though. It was a 1 season 10 episode run on WB and that was it.
It's ok, Hank. Just don't burn down the dealership.
Just bought one marked down from $180 to $50. Even more excited now 
Came back surprised to see how much this blew up. I loved old school Forum and special blend gear from playing Amped 2 like 4 months before I started snowboarding. About to finally go again this season after 3 years and I bought around $600 of special blend gear super marked down for $120 from thehouse.com and I'm STOKED for it to show up.

Thanks for your input everyone

I live in upper middle class Iowa suburban area and it is literally difficult to go 3 lights without seeing an older male/retired female driving an automatic mustang/Corvette. I almost see them more than civics, crossovers, etc.

There is a guy near me that has a decent looking SRT-4 and it sits outside this vape shape every day. Not sure if he DDs it or it's just always broken but it's a bit more refreshing than the 35 blue or silver WRXs that run around here. Or the obligatory IROC/lifted pickup/Jeep Bros.

Is that a joke? Go read guru3ds Ryzen 1600 reviews. What third world country are you living in where a DUAL CORE offers a great user experience??? Quad cores are almost dated at this point!!!! Stop drinking the Kool aid. There's no shame in admitting you can't afford good hardware but don't be salty and try to make up "alternative facts". The 1300x is better in all ways and loses maybe 30-40% of the time in SPECIFIC Intel favored games AND offers a better Windows experience.
 http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/amd_ryzen_5_1600_review,24.html

"The more I test quad-core processors the less excited I am getting about them. A move to six and eight-core processors to me feels like the right thing to do as I do feel my overall desktop experience is much snappier and faster compared to any brand quad-core CPU, really go ask some users in our forums as it really feels and seems faster.Â "

Yeah they went out of business for like 4 or 5 years and then restarted.
Still super impressive. I went from 220-175 then back up to 200 and I still have some super noticeable purple stretch marks on my inner thighs/hips. Much more noticeable than you by far.

I'm most impressed how good of shape your skin is still in! I cant see any visible stretch marks or anything.

Nice genetics.
Yeah i need at least an 11. Thanks for the offer though.
For sure I hate how hard it is to find old releases. Id kill to find a clean pair of Kostons again.
This particular shoe is the 'es SLB mid in black leather.
Yeah when they went out of business forever ago I was crushed. Besides Circa the 'es were always my go to since the Bob Burnquist gold vert early x games days. Clean shoe, durable, and most of all COMFORTABLE. I distinctly remember a white pair of Koston signature 6s or 7s I had that had a plaid covering up front, one of the nicest shoes I've ever owned.

'es new shoes are SUPER versatile between the Accel Slim, OG accel, etc. Highly recommend looking into them for anyone that doesnt just wanna pick up another paid of Nike SBs.
Bluetooth is handy but I enjoy music quality and the LG V30 has the quad DAC set up with the 3.5 mm jack along with higher quality music file suppprt.
Its actually a very hard to find case. Ive only managed to find 1 on microcenter website for $300.

Not as easy as just buying it. But the inwin 303 is a close second looks wise.

Keep us updated on the damage. Could just be the mobo/psu
This advice is sketchy and terrible.....

But if you happened to run over to Best Buy and buy another same 1080 ti, and then returned the broken one in its place and claim its a defect, you could keep the new one and at least recover that.

Scumbaggy advice but its not like it goes back out on the floor and I feel super bad about your loss. Will definitely be unplugging always during storms now.
Legit looking into this now as well...

AZZA csa9 Titan tempered glass case: $60

Just gotta shop around. Segotep also makes a nice budget case, as well as ThermalTake
Youll never learn unless you just do it. The hardest part is probably attaching the pc case buttons because the pins are so small but even with that you wpuldnt be able to break anything from hooking it up wrong.

Relax, take pictures, be methodical, have fun.
My pc has a led logo on the power shroud that covers the psu. I also have a Molex extender I use to power what little Molex items I have.

Instead of plugging in the LED, I accidentally plugged a female to male molex into the extender and thus was essentially rerouting that circuit DIRECTLY back into the PSU.

Long story short, I turn pc power on, it flashes for a second, then shuts off. Because im stupid, I continue to power on the PC about 20 more times until it won't turn on at all anymore.

Casualties: MSI am3+ board: $140
8350 cpu: $130
Hue+: $60
Wifi card: $50

Best part is I kept trying to redo the pc with a new mobo/cpu and couldn't ever get it to work, only to find out 2 months of trying later that it was the fried network card making the system crash.

Fun times.
For sure!

Memory: 128 gig SanDisk ssd and 1 tb 7200 rpm WD drive
Lighting: cheap offbrand LEDs. Awaiting hue plus to show up.

As far as the setup around me:
Desk: some crazy cherry oak executive desk that was like $500 that I got for free from family

Monitors: top LG 29 inch ultrawide 2560x1080

Some cheaper Sennhesiers for audio editing as well.

I also bought a near full size Buster sword that sits to the left of me. I just tell people about it so I justify the money I spent on it.

I think that's about it.


For sure! That ryzen platform has such a low entry cost so its super easy to piece together an entry rig for not so much money (gpu mining craze aside)
Yeah I'm going to be order another mobo and then throw this cpu into a surprise build for one of my friends dad whos a huge FPS fan
Yeah its a slight annoyance, having said that I've got a Hue plus on the way and with that much lighting the rgb of the board is hardly visible.

The 3000gt vr4 also had 4 wheel steering and ran production from 1991-1999 in the United states.

Look up the concept version one they did for some random Jackie Chan movie. It was essentially a vr4 with a Targa top and a different spoiler. (Not to be confused with the spyder vr4s)

Also not sure, but both the Galant vr4 as well as certain Honda Prelude Si's were advertised as 4 wheel steering as well.
Its like a IRL Monty Python sketch

Love the 30th Ann. run. I picked up the SE version awhile ago.

http://imgur.com/fhM4giM
For sure. $30 a month isn't TERRIBLE, especially considering it means I wont be tacking on $40 extra for cable through mediacom before all sorts of little charges pop up, especially when after the 1st year the entire price sky rockets.
No kidding. Factor in the idea of 4k content (40 gigs to download a 4k movie vs using like 3x that in just random 4k streaming) and apply that to your eventual monthly data cap from your ISP and the piracy option is very attractive even outside of saving money.

Having said that I got a DCIM copyright notice literally yesterday so I need to cool it for a few werjs. 

Another option if youve got a 4k setup and don't wanna burn through your data cap is find a local movie rental place (family video in the Midwest) and RENT 4k blu rays.

Its actually kind of fun. Reminds me of when it was fun to go to blockbuster but without the higher prices.
[Gear] FINALLY GOT A PRS!!!!!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/5ryfzv/gear_finally_got_a_prs/
For sure! I was always super into PRS guitars (used to have a Schecter c1 classic) but obviously could never afford one. So last year I told myself id buy a high end SE and if I liked it id buy a USA model.

This is a 2015 release 30th anniversary SE custom 24 and I fucking love it so far. Was gonna put those SD alphea/omega pickups in it but I love the versatility so much i think I'm just gonna go buy a newer ibanez or ltd for the lower tuned stuff.

Id highly recommend those newer se custom 24s though. I think the only exclusive of the 30th Ann. SEs was the binding and the color choices.

This is so accurate and it seems the opioid epidemic people don't get this. They stare at the side of it from their point of view and don't ever think what its like from the doctors side. Thats what makes it so much more difficult then "hurr durr stop giving out pain pills to anyone."

Stop giving pain pills to a football player thats been on them for years consistently and he'll turn to something worse. You cant just cut people off out of nowhere because "opiods is bad, mmmmkay"
Or you could stop being a pussy and go live your life to the fullest. 
Just happened to me too. Severe side pain on right side. Remember hearing a weird pop a few days ago but ignore that and get anxious about appendix.

Went to doctor yesterday and he said dislocated a whole series of nerves off of cartilage that attaches to one of my lower ribs.

I wish it would have just been my appendix.
The ecu will negate and tune out any exhaust/intake/etc mods you do and tune the car for econonny. Often it seems alot of guys in the forums would actually LOSE low end tq and gain a small amount of top end power. Personally for DD or city driving, id find this detrimental.

Lol never buy a 3000gt if you think timing belts aren't important
Never go to jiffy lube. Go to local owned shops.

Oil changes every 3-5k (you should be checking pil level now and then for consumption)

Visiual inspection of suspension parts every 30k or so

Transmission flush/fluid change every 50k or so

Rotate tires every 15k

Change timing belt/spark plugs at 60 k-80k depending on car (timing chains are usually 100k) along with water and oil pump while they have it tore down to do the belt/chain

Inspect engine bay every so often to make sure battery/wires look like theyre in good shape.

I mean that's a huge chunk of just basic maintenance right there 
Miss the personality, dont miss the rattles and the chassis flex.
My sister and I were adopted by my parents when were like 3 and 4 by my grandparents because my dad couldnt handle having 2 kids at like 23 and just wanted to party more and my mom could sink back into her high school recreation drug habits. Supposedly when it got bad and we lived with my mom in a small trailer, dhs came one day and found the place stacked with trash knee high and 3 year old me wandering around with a can of raid pointed at my eyes.

My grandpa and grandma (she passed away from various illnesses when I was 16 in her 50s) raised us and gave us the best damn life they could. They knew there was a hole from them not being our "real" mom and dad but they gave it everything they had after both having just finished raising their own kids (my grandpa's daughter getting pregnant at like 15, my grandmas daughter (mom) being a constant partier/troublesome kid, and my uncle who went on to teach music at UofBoulder, Kent state, and then UMASS) so they had their handfuls already and STILL took us in.

My grandpa had a son named Matt who passed away when he was 13, about a year before I was born. He died in a jet ski accident when some immigrant lady who had no idea what she was doing rammed into the side of him at high speed. I cant imagine what that day was like.

I remember having some stupid argument with him when I was like 12 and basically overheard my grandma tell him "I know he'll never be Matt, but hes still your grandson and he's the closest you got" or something along those lines. Was like a gut check of reality punch straight to the stomach. I think I laid there and thought about it in our window for maybe an hour. It slowly started to piece together in my head what the reality of our upbringing really was.

Of course after calming down and looking out the window sulking for about an hour, heres my fucking grandpa with his Lethal Weapon era Mel Gibson hair scooting down our sidewalk on my Pokemon skateboard trying to make me laugh.

Man I love that guy. So damn much. Loved being able just to call him today and whine about my problems and say happy fathers day. He gave it all over and over and over again through his life, and when he retired recently and we were selling that house, I remember he told me "You know out of anyone I've ever lived with besides your grandma, ive been with you the longest."

Wouldnt have had it any other way.
Some of those trd 2000gts (wide mr2) were north of 500hp.... In a 2800 pound mid ship.

Bit more than cosmetic lol. But modern day trd would meet that criteria almost to a tee.
True story, having said that the TRD 2000gt (widebody mr2 with insane factory HP) is a fucking jem and one of the sweetest in the entire history of toyota.
Loved 13 alot. Honestly if they ever came out with a new nhl game on pc id play it no matter how shit it was.
A COSMIC CASTAWAY

OH YEAHHHHHH

Man nothing ever could recapture that low budget generic 2000s alternative rock" sound ever again. 

Possibly only beaten in music by Disney Channels original "Motocrossd".
Jesus, take off the tin foil hate dude....... We constantly encourage people to find used phones as a financial savvy alternative to buying newer phone from us if they cant afford it....

What the fuck are you even on about?
Uhhhh ok?
I can't speak for most but I work for US Cellular here in the USA and we offer to unlock any phone that's been paid off if it was purchased during a financed phone agreement. Most newer Samsungs or IPhones are already unlocked and available for use on whatever carrier youd like, along with the fact that our Total Plans only commitment is not a contract but only you paying off the entirety of whatever phone the customer chooses. 

I always try to explain that 3-4 times to every customer to make sure they understand that. K hate seeing people feel like they were tricked into staying with us and thats NOT how our store wants to do business. 

We try to use other carriers phones on our service but the simple fact is our towers only let us use certain providers phones (I believe were CDMA towers, dont quote me on that.)
Love your videos! Katie is my cousin and speaks of you regularly!! Hope to see you at a family meet up here eventually!!
Fuck off Lahey

For those wondering about the current setup:

AZZA titan tempered glass case,
Evga 1070 s.c.,
Amd 1100t 6 core,
Some crappy Asus m-atx board (previous 8320 and msi board died recently, get cheap spare parts in mean time),
Hp IPS led 25 es,
Older hp 16x9 monitors on sides,
Razer chroma keyboard,
Roccat cheap mouse,
Cheap insignia speakers/sub,
Behringer UM2 audio interface,
Astro a-40 mixamp,
Hyper x cloud stinger stereo headset.
Also please forgive my spelling lol
I plan to: pickup my new desk in about 4 days, purchase an ultrawide and possibly cut down on monitors to save room, receive my am4 board, 1600 cpu, second hue plus kit for new desk backlighting, reposition our 55inch 4k parallel to the new setup for added convenience, purchase a new tv stand for the tv to cut down on space, get a set of studio monitors for my prs se custom 24 as well as some kind of couch and new office chair. As always, any input/suggestions on any of these parts/items would be much appreciated!!
Great work. On a side note, I use alot of guitar amp sims and I'm looking into getting a pair of fairly low volume studio monitors for guitar as well as daily media use. Can you make any recommendations? I wont be doing much mixing so the eq balance isnt a big deal to me.
JNCO jeans and those tech deck t shirts that came with the free skateboard/bike. 

You never even cared how the shirt looked, you just bought it for the toy.
Makes me think of the "cooking with scorpion" video they added to Deadly Alliance. https://youtu.be/C-c4U6XRtvc
Will I be ok to just request a new axle nut when I get a new wheel hub bearing/alignment tomorrow?
I recently hit a exposed sewer cover /pot hole in my 95 del sol. It started to feel lately like the car would sway left/right and on the way home today it literally felt likethe wheel was going to fall off.

I recently had both lower ball joints replaced as well as all tie rods. I knew I still had to do a wheel hub bearing and get an alignment but typically with bad wheel hub bearings when theyre really bad they make a loud noise (I had none).

I get out and check my wheels today and both rims appear to be cracked like this in the front. Am I correct in assuming that these rims are destroyed and was what was causing that loose wheel feeling?
Is the middle of the rim supposed to be completely cracked like that?
Love it, OP. I got this 2015 30th anniversary se custom 24 roughly 8 months ago and have loved it ever since. Wish I could have gotten the signatured prs headstock like all the new ones though!!!

Geeeeeeet it on!!!!!!
Holy crap came back and so many upvotes! Thanks guys, I hope you can draw inspiration off this and eat as much chicken breast as you can humanly consume.
Much gracias
Thanks!!!
Awesome thanks! I'm more technically inclined but it's hard to implement the majority of metal/prog sweeps into a new genre. One step at a time!
Is it on the stock suspension? Mines on lowering springs and it rides really rough on not so nice city roads. Assumed it was just the short wheelbase.
Bullshit. My boss prmoised me it was consistent hours in my store with employment at least through the end of 2017. I now dont have a job and I wish I never would have taken it.

Some of us weren't told that it was seasonal at all. And it seemed a great offer ($16/hour, 30hours a week)
Hi there! I made a reddit post a few days ago regarding this very subject (and had since deleted it)

Let me fill in some REAL info for you: most of us were serious gamers who LOVED the product.

We got paid a MINIMUM of $16/hr, some of us more.

I almost NEVER had any issues with my personal demo station.

People of all ages loved the demos and we sold at least 3-4 a week no issue, we constantly would sell out.

I dont know why I'm defending the oculus when I was FIRED a few days ago for making a thread asking any of the other reps if they still had jobs after they basically cut ALL COMMUNICATION between each other after announcing the "changes" coming.

I keep noticing this pattern of behavior. If someone doesn't like the oculus, its like the whole sub reddit attacks someone. There was nothing wrong with my particular demo station and it was successful. I lost my job due to proper lack of communication and for that I'm unhappy at oculus, but life goes on. Some of these reps were hard working smart people. And your comment is a spit in their face.
Yeah I looked at a lot of mh-1000 ltds before the PRS. Would still like to pickup some kind of mod spec ibanez or ltd for the lower tunings.
Thanks!!! Was a bit skeptic of the "orange" color but besides this and some of the other limited run 30th Ann. (Namely the Gothic purple one), I felt like this had the most natural looking wood finish.
For suuuuuuuuuuure. Now I just stare at every other guitar and say "fucks sake I want (insert guitar name)" ;)
480 is outperforming the 1060 with current drivers. By a decent margin. Go look at current benchmarks.

Coming from a 1060->480->1070 owner

Thanks! I'm hoping after I get the x52 kraken I'll be done with flashy bullshit and actually focus on new hardware lol
for anyone that just wants to see the finished build without pouring through the un-intentionally un-organized imgur photos: http://i.imgur.com/IDCFntJ.jpg
Why? It feels very study even with everything on it.
I just simply don't have the money yet to get matching ones lol. I actually started off with a y50 laptop I traded for a used desktop and upgraded parts in it from there. Everything I have was more or less leftover bits and pieces I got here and there. So I'm hoping to upgrade with 1 more of the same HP IPS led 25 inch and possibly a 2k or 4k monitor for the middle.

I just got a really good job so I'm just waiting to reap the financial benefits ;) should be going piece by piece soon.

Thank you!
I've actually gotten used to it but I admit it's strange. Thanks for the input still got some work to do!
Its just been a cheap temporary solution until I can get some mounted studio monitors. Im.also just trying to grab 2 of the same 25 inch monitors just to round everything out.

I got the desk for like $30 on Craigslist. Maybe I'll look into another one. Thanks for the input.
