I like how they have us nothing after last season for completing every challenge 😭
Idk. Gbay99 did it
Hit lvl 70 and do all weekly challenges + daily challenges. Pretty sure that's all you need
It's pree cool imo
They just don't want to say it's a released game because they know how broken and buggy the game is
Wtf wasn't last week's challenge search chests in haunted hills?
It's so ass. When I get it as my first gun and someone comes up on me I spray them down but they 1 shot me with a tac shotty in my feet
A kid (Orange shirt kid as he is referred to) made a <hashtag> boogiedownchallenge dance, and didn't win. Everyone memed that he should've won so they did this. It still isn't his dance though, they messed it up
I feel like they had that dance from Roy purdy but just renamed it to make us happy. That isn't the orange shirt kid's dance FACT
Really? I'm pretty sure even if you didn't know something was illegal, you can't defend yourself with "I didn't know it was illegal." But I'm not a lawyer so what do I know ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Depends on the update you're running
Should've been 45 because he killed all 4 of those kids at the end
My friend is enough proof of that
Agreed but it seems you have a problem with the word 'simply' lol
I SAVED UP 1000 VBUCKS THIS SEASON TO GET THE NEXT BATTLE PASS BUT THEN THEY RELEASED THE SQUAT KICK SO NOW I HAVE TO BUY S4 BP WITH REAL MONEY AGAIN
I really hope season 5 is greek/roman mythology. That would be so cool. I imagine tier 100 being Hades with fiery dark wings
Wish I could post a pic of my ps4 and get 19k upvotes + gold
That nail is really off-putting
No console either?

Why are people like this
No, because it is much more defined. If you compare it to the quality loss on the llama, you'll see.
Using a mouse on your phone for... Discord?
These scrubs think it's an occasion but this is literally me every day
This john wick does not represent us. We have since disowned him.

-Committee of John Wicks
haHAA but I can
Greek/Roman mythology next PLEASE
If there wasn't bloom in the game I'd die a lot less
Just like playing hardpoint in COD
Can we get a follow up??? Like did you message him saying not to worry or something? UGH PLEASE
I think you're about to get hired by Epic
It's not optimized and feels really weird. I'd be surprised if a lot of people normally play with it
Most of these, to me, seem like the person themself/doctors just brush off the symptoms, I've only seen a few where they were concerned about the cost.
Zeus tier 70 and Hades tier 100 would be perfect
They didn't even release the snoop emote on 4/20...
Yeah I can't believe it myself
Large if factual
Someone else on this subreddit that uses Sync... Hmmm a rare sight indeed
I just caught a ditto yesterday, and I don't even have the challenge yet 😥
I've always turned off data whenever I'm not using my phone or I'm on wifi, it's common sense. Just never use mobile data unless you have to.
Damn, I took screenshots of this like 2 or 3 weeks ago and completely forgot! Anyway, here's mine:

Ah, I see what you mean.
Why would you reveal this
>can read at a 12th grade level in 4th grade

>becomes illiterate

???
I was tier 68/70 last season, so I didn't even get black knight... I don't think I'd consider it old school, though
Yeah like the ground for under the tiles in West side of tilted
A lot of people who juul/vape do that. That's like the go to for them
I've only done it for my first win back in january (4 days after I started playing, was very proud) but I actually know people who still post and they get like 1 kill like we know you got carried
dont remind them!!
yeah but they could get spammed and shit
It has been suggested, multiple times, but they've never implemented it
Yeah I do this but it's not an unconscious decision to do it
There should be a giant ass tunnel behind Lonely Lodge's waterfall all the way to Loot Lake's
lol who tf uses their PSN as a watermark
Square up
Was and has been snowing here for the past week here in NY. I hate this state sometimes
For me I'll just be running in the middle of no where and get caught by two squads
It disappoints me that theres always that one kid that ruins it for the rest
Why do they have to ruin everything that was fine before
When the game was released I thought it was going to be like the games where you have a party of 6 and you can capture or battle wild Pokemon and other people, but I guess not haha.
How do you play/enjoy this game on 200 ping
I've seen many of the videos too, and most of them are when the dude is wearing a uniform to buy something with a military/veteran discount, then gets called out by the camera guy who says "HOW DARE YOU WEAR THAT UNIFORM, I WORE THAT AND I'VE HAD FRIENDS DIE IN THAT UNIFORM"

Thank God I revisited my account last year then, didn't even know this was a thing.
This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

#THE CRIMSON CHIN
I really don't know how they messed this up tbh
I only hop on once a day to get my daily challenge done because I get bullshitted every single match so id rather just not play to the point of raging
Anyone else not see the cam until he stood up at the end? Or is that just me?
It's at least from 2011
For almost all of middle school and high school I walked home (it's only a mile but still)
Yess
#b o n n e r s
Why would you remove him tho
What do you mean by maps? Sorry, I just started playing again, last time I played was the release month back in July 2016
Was hoping for something cool and rustic... Disappointed
Obviously it's wailing woods, where else would it be?
...no google account?
haha lonely and depressed as well
I like how you instantly died to the splash damage, but I have 2 clips of people straight EATING rockets
Skin customization. Not weapon skins, we don't even have those (yet?).
So when they come to this subreddit to steal content and ideas, will they see this or just ignore it?
I hate when some bs like this happens and then the kid who killed you starts dancing like he's good
I looked someone directly in the face, pulled the trigger on my pump, but instead it froze and killed me instead.
If PS4: make a party and adjust chat audio bar to the left so you can still fully hear the game, but now that you're in a party you don't have to hear them/talk to them

Other than that, just take out your mic/mute your mic or mute chat audio. I wish you could mute people but as it stands you can't.
How do you even communicate for this to happen
I can still remember the areas that used to be there before tilted, shifty, snobby, haunted. Good times just chilling out running on the edge of the map looting those houses with the shed/garage
Except real albinos have a painful time seeing... well anything
Seeing that your whiscash is 15kg (it is also tagged by the game as Extra Small) compared to the other two 58kg and 59kg, I think it's scaled correctly. There are different sizes within the same species, ever seen the show?
I just want to let everyone know to save their murkrow candies for gen 4
I'm impressed the cartridge's battery didn't run dry
bitch
wait unblock me i need to tell you something
Don't you love picking this up, shooting someone in the chest, only for it to do 50 dmg to shield? Love it
Why is there so much useless water? Are they planning something? 🤔
Fr like why
Yesyesyesyesyes
Username is fitting.
I know, that's why we tried sending him a screenshot of the win but he had his messages privated, hence why I posted this.
Why does bloom even exist? The real questions here
I'll shoot someone for like 50 damage with a blue pump with 100% accuracy point blank range and they'll just 1 shot me with a white tac shotty
They also give higher-ping'd McDonald's wifi lookin ass people the advantage compared to people who spend more money to get better internet. I can think of so many times where I died by someone just lagging out so badly but they still get the kill because they'll go through a fuckin door or some shit. Pisses me off
I go to a public school and we have this entire week off... lol
F
Exactly my thought as well haha
I haven't been able to play since Wednesday.
Wtf
We need a plague doctor asap
I don't like it because everything should be uniform. What Samsung/Pixel 2XL is doing now is perfect, they have no notches, just the small top and bottom bezels.
Since they only know about these because of this subreddit, do they just ignore all the posts that shit on them?
hmmm
Wow, I never thought that post from r/teenagers yesterday could be a meme format. Genius!

https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/8860a0
They should change the tac shotties back. As soon as they made white tac a thing i instantly said "THAT'S DISGUSTING." There's something off about it 

It really doesn't look right
Do you not have any games? Watch YouTube? Any other social media?
/r/mildlyinfuriating how you didn't clean the sink before taking the picture
Gotta make sure he got that screenshot
It's funny cuz he doesn't even play ps4
Fix: random freezing. The game still runs and everything, but my character randomly freezes and I can't move forward or do anything besides look around. And now in the loading screen when returning to lobby, the game freezes sometimes as well.
If you need to keyboard on a mobile game you're probably traaaash
He's the base male character. I'm pretty sure the base female is the white brunette.
I think that's called dyslexia
This is like that shit with the kid who saves a girl from getting bullied, then they fall in love, have a kid, then the original kid (now dad) goes to the military and dies or some shit I forgot but it's really sad like this
#MAXIMUM GLOW
Supposed to deep fry it not pixelate it .-.
Didn't move like a bot. Bots just stand there and shit. This guy drove around and got out of his car, started moving side to side too
That's the spirit
It's coming out later this year, right? Idk. I've always been interested but my computer is shite for gaming so I'm waiting for mobile.
Yeah... But it's a new dance
I hate when people just don't give up and constantly shoot at you for minutes at a time
I thought that was what was going to happen
Remember that guy who dropped in shifty, and started quickscoping like 3 people? Yeah I saw that yesterday on Instagram and it has 200k+ views, and they put their own stupid ass stamp over it to watermark something they don't even own.
Depends on the phone you're using and the settings
Just saying but absolutely NO mobile game is worth $60. The highest I'd say for any mobile game is like $5 or $6.
It's called rooting, where you can literally do anything you want.
[First match of pubg I ever played.](https://i.imgur.com/kAijqie.jpg) (this is also on release day) I downloaded it because I thought it would be a nice substitute to fortnite since fortnite mobile isn't on Android yet, which I don't think I'll play much of anyway.

Edit: ok so apparently your first game is just infected with boots, that's fair. But since I've been climbing up the ranks I still do really well. I have won with my squad once or twice I think, (and yes it was against real people haha)

Edit 2: [won solo squads](https://i.imgur.com/0v7WVeH.jpg)
There is on Android, even if the game doesn't support it. But that's android. You could probably jailbreak your iPhone to use a controller but idk.
Well he doesn't because this is a stolen post.
FIRST TRYYYYYYYYYY
I can hear this gif
Probably because there's 3 of them and they all promote Spotify premium
You gave a bunny... To cats...
I was going there either way
Sorry but we've told them this a thousand times and they still don't respond or actually do it.
I know how to write cursive but I haven't used it since 4th grade (when I learned it)
Yeah but these accounts are run by idiots who usually don't own Photoshop and don't know how to do that
This subreddit is about the game, not life itself
I've grown up with my cat (he's 15, I'm 18) and he just sits there like he doesn't understand me at all.
I love this haha
Is it at 2:41 AM on a Sunday night?
My friends and I have never experienced lag like this (we all have regular PS4s besides my one friend). We've experienced hiccups (especially when getting out of the bus) but never lagging to where we don't know where we landed.
Sometimes I accidentally leave out of habit from solos but I don't leave the lobby
Should send him the link to this to make him more salty
I think he meant it doesn't happen like this. It's not as bad as xbox's problem
"did I hit something? Oh well"
Yeah true but still... like I'm pretty sure everyone has a set of earbuds or something.
They always die first and disconnect immediately. I really don't understand why people go solo w/fill in squads and just go away from the 3 other people. The only thing I've heard is that some people try to get their top 12 squads challenge done, but most of the time the randos just drop and play normally, sooo
I cannot relate because in no way did I get a 1590 SAT
Probably a thing from the school itself. My school has a series on YouTube of a school shooting simulation
If I don't know it by the end of class then I don't know it.
Are you blind?
I love this so much.
Yet I can't shoot a shotgun through a wide open window.
It's such a bandwagon. Why is everyone saying this so recently? Why not when it came out? Exactly
I'm sorry im not bashing you or anything but why do a surprising amount of people not know this? It's a button on your controller ffs
Can't he sue the school or something...? Pretty sure that's illegal
Practice landing in populated areas and killing people. Landing off and random quiet places is not the way to go when you are new to the game.
But don't you think they should account for that? With all these bugs they're treating this game as if only 10 people play it. I understand it's hard or whatever but with every update they break something else that was working fine before, which I don't think I've ever seen in other games before.
You cannot legitimately have it without buying tiers yet
This went on for longer than I thought, even though I'm pretty sure I've (sadly) seen all of these
You mean getting ready for a normal day?
If only it was real ;/
Not relatable unless I'm mowing the lawn
I just want the volkssturmgewehr. That's the one I missed out on from resistance (fortnite...)

I think you're just the best with or without editing
DROP THE BAN HAMMER!! We demand justice!!
Idk why bloom is even a mechanic in the first place. If you ask me, it makes no sense
I've always loved the plague doctor outfit. People say they would buy concept skins instantly, but this I actually would insta buy
This game is mostly bullshit and luck, and sometimes both of those.
I need the answer
Im glad they're ignoring and forgetting sbmm.
I love what you're doing but as someone who used to give my designs away for free, when I was younger, this is how you get taken advantage of. Just don't let it happen to you.
Why did you think this was a good idea
I don't think they're shitty per se, but they're overused just like the homemade shield potions
Why does that post not have as much recognition as the other skin ideas? 🤔
Ngl, I'm disappointed that this didn't end with "now we've been married for <x> years"
1mil vbucks
It's the fact that he wasn't paying attention makes it so much better you can tell how shite he is
Everytime I land at snobby the circle is always so far away and I don't have enough time to loot the entire place
1. It'll probably look like SHITE and

2. Probably gonna take up a ton of data (if using data and not on wifi, like at school or in the car or something).
Can't tell if she's in 2018 or 2011 rawr xd phase
I'm pretty sure like no one in my school knows what 9gag is anyway so we good
From /u/davidvonderhaar:

"There is no blacklist. Only parties and team balancing. When this happens to you, it's because of who is available to play against at that time. Lots of solo players who aren't good and then you.

The only true way around it is to party up.

-V"

This system is complete SHITE for a solo player (I usually play solo), and can say that with 100% certainty from my experience of grinding through all the triple plays and gram slam(s), and playing in general.
I love when I point blank people with the rpg and it does 0 damage to them but when someone shoots me and it hits like 20 feet away it still 1 shots me
I really do hate the match making system in this game. It's literally you and 5 other scrubs against 6 other people at your level. I have no idea why they did that.
Now i want a plague doctor skin. 
Found two people doing this so we tried to help but they ended up trying to fight us instead :(
HOLY...
Ah, so you're my next-door neighbor
I posted this yesterday and said it happens all the time in combat and I got downvoted instead.
Not gonna lie...

I thought I was the only one. These are my exact times, too...
100% feel
Don't you love when you headshot someone at point blank range with the pump and it does 8 damage but when someone does it to you with a tac shotty you get one shotted even tho you had 100/100
It's Gnar from League of Legends. One of his skins is dino gnar
It's not frame dropping for me, it's just glitching forward. Definitely not my connection, either. It's server lag 100%
Or COD on PS3.

So. Many. Mexicans. Worst part? They were all tryhards
Yeah probably
Or that he did this in a neighborhood instead of like rural area or something
is this frame dropping though? This seems more like server lag. It happens to me sometimes (PS4) where I just randomly glitch forward. Happens to my friends sometimes, too.
I absolutely hate this quest. I got all the other ones done yesterday, but this one is stupid af. Every time I've landed in wailing, only one or no chests spawn.

Do you think epic play tests their game? Because I don't.

I was actually thinking about this yesterday. Instead of every death, every time you rage (which can be more than the amount of times you die!), do a set of an exercise.
Yes. You will get any prime loot as long as your PSN is connected to your twitch prime account
THIS MAN CANNOT BE STOPPED


TILTED TOWER TYRANT
I have so many clips of the inconsistencies that I was thinking about making a montage of em. I just have the worst luck.
I'm still not sure how/why they haven't fixed it, but yes it happens to everyone I'm pretty sure.
I haven't experienced it until last night. I was doing good, and went from pleasant all the way to tilted, and as I was about to enter tilted, the game just randomly crashed. Nothing eventful happened in game, no 10 rpgs at once, it just crashed.

PS4.
Need new friends if they don't care about this!
Whenever I get a gold scar in the early game it's just destiny that I die by some bs
Yeah but now you can barely hear it in the game
I don't even see 20 people in a single game. Insane!!
4 hours?

that's nothing

(send help)
Omg I remember going to norsk to talk with people in master/champs lmaoo
Oh. Whenever my friend gets the chance to talk to randoms he just yells profanity and tries to get them to say it as well... Not all are like that though <3
Yeah I barely understand anything in this one
The "last online" part is the heavy hitter
what if they see this post tho
The quality of this picture says otherwise.
**Explanation**: I didn't encounter this bug before, but now when I need building the most, it doesn't work.

**Evidence**: [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvoYTQF390E)

**If replicable, how**: Not sure, sometimes building just doesn't build.

**Platform**: PS4

EDIT: getting shot through my buildings, like when I build a wooden wall, their bullet still goes through. Has happened to me once (or more) every game so far.
I'm rocking that skin on the right for sure
Probably gonna be how the Scar is to the M16. Let's just hope the gold rarity of this deagle is a golden deagle!
Doesn't matter if you have crosshairs or not when bloom is a shitty mechanic that still exists
>a l e c t r i c a l
u just like them towers

Why are you still arguing lmao. You're the biggest hypocrite I've ever seen. 

My original comment saying "...couple of WEEKS?" I don't think that was an asshole comment at all. I found it unreasonable that he didn't learn from his mistakes, but he told me the reason why. I never told him he was shit or was condescending at all.

Also, I am not an asshole. Sometimes you have to be mean to learn. I am done with this, I hope you have a good day, and I'm sorry that whatever made you mad at me hopefully you won't take out on others, I would hate for you to embarrass yourself in front of others.

Edit: also I did not try to make myself look better. You said I tried to get a win yesterday and didn't but I clearly did. That was the purpose of me saying I won solo in duos.
What are you talking about? I was by myself in the duos gamemode (my friend died within less than a minute of landing).

>you clearly didn’t win anything in elementary English 

You're still talking shit. And maybe YOU didn't "win" anything in elementary English. Example:

so·lo
ˈsōlō
noun
1.
a thing done by one person unaccompanied, in particular.
I won solo in duos yesterday (it was my third or fourth game) and then spent time with friends for the rest of the day lol. You really don't know what you're talking about. I'm not talking shit to him, he actually gave me an answer that I found very reasonable, and now YOU are the one talking shit to people over the internet.

Projection.
People get bored because there's nothing else to do because it's vanilla
I'm not projecting my insecurities over the internet... That doesn't even make sense. I'm done with this shit, I hate this site
...couple of WEEKS?
Idk why they keep making unnecessary changes that no one asked for. Like, FIX THE GAME FIRST!!!
Our school blocked it but then we got it unblocked through a school wide petition. Around 400/1000 kids signed (it mightve been more, I was an early sign).
Wow totally haven't seen this 10 other times on this sub
You know this sub went normie when this is marked as NSFW
I mean 2 days play time since the game came out isn't a lot tbh.
[press f](https://i.imgur.com/Dchm7qa.jpg)
I HATE YOU GUYS
or "Rusty Rivalry" ?
Always happens to me when I land at snobby, too.

I think it's cursed.
I still have to run a lot. A lot of times, the circle spawns the furthest place possible from me
If you're on reddit you're probably not doing any bullying.
"if we could spectate our **friend(s)**"
yes yes yes yes
All you have to say is "well I made it to the final two teams by myself while you guys were SHITE and died early on"
It's sad that you got downvoted but then the dude correcting PikachuBlu got upvoted even though he backed up what you said.

Sometimes I really just hate this site. And people.
I never trust people. The shit I see on here where two strangers meet and are friendly never happens to me.
Just keep the game the way it is, instead of trying to break it with every update!
Western NY, we have the best chicken wings and pizza.
Yeah, well you're 13. You'll get there
Then you need to either speak up or don't talk when you're in a loud environment
What does that have to do with being good lol
In BO3, confirmed by /u/davidvonderhaar, 

"There is no blacklist. Only parties and team balancing. When this happens to you, it's because of who is available to play against at that time. Lots of solo players who aren't good and then you.

The only true way around it is to party up.

-V"

In WWII it's a bit different, but if I wanted to play ranked, I'd play ranked. I just want to casually play pubs and go against randoms, not sweaty tryhards every. single. game.
That's ranked bro. I'm talking about pubs. If I wanted to constantly face people who were of equal level, I'd play ranked.
Why do they always get the neck wrong?
>on distribution of skill

Stop trying to break your game!!! Guarenteed this could end fortnite.
Yes, that's why I've been playing more fortnite than cod at the moment. Too much trying, not enough relaxing.
Just look at how SBMM screwed up COD.
They really need to change the hitbox of trees. 
This always happens to me when I go to snobby shores, or anywhere in general.
Loafers will always be one hunnid
Honestly how did people not know about this? I know iOS doesn't get the beta but the beta has been like this for over a month maybe 2.
practice and he has a high sensitivity. High sensitivity is key for this, that's why PC players can build so fast (and key binds, but that's a different story)
SOILED IT
I've gotten kicked out twice so far. And both times I was doing really good... :(
Yeah I hate it when im shooting someone and all the bullets just go AROUND them, like wtf???
Tell them your situation. I'm not sure if your dean or whoever is suspending you is an asshole, but maybe it might help them understand where you're coming from.
I've never called my dad "daddy" nor have I called my mom "mommy." Not when I was 2, not while I ever live. I think it's only acceptable if you're daddy's little princess.
Oh.
Yes because the minority 150 neo nazis in alabama are messing up our entire future.
I've only posted my first win ever and one time where i won twice in a row
No, that would be illegal >:0
Yeah but now he knows you fuck with him
Too young.
I call the phenomenon of developers not taking care of Android, "snapchat-itis"
It's not even that h a r d
Carbonmade has a sort of feed that you can see, of people's works
Why not just download it again from where you got it?
Or add a colorblind filter like almost every other game
Just like how the tactical smg is just a tec 9 with attachments on it
Happens on PS4 but can happen to any chest I'm pretty sure. It's happened to me randomly at random chests around the map.
You can just press start tho
SHG wish they could compete
Because stream sniping is cheating
What about duos/squads? It's already a thing tbh.
Bruh he said friends, not himself...
Very jealous!
How far down did you have to dig to find this ancient meme?
>put 10 bullets...into them
Whenever they put out the update patch notes I saw it and it said it didn't stack and replenishes health and armor fully
Not to be rude but, does anyone read patch notes anymore? It says it in the patch notes.
For me, I walk up behind someone, put 10 bullets of a purple scar into them, they turn around and one shot me with a white pump when I have full health/shield.
By my luck it'd be some random casual that would just blast me instantly
Yeah I also have to press square twice or three times to pick up a weapon or something.
Yeah, well 200+ ms ain't doing you any favors...
If you start to bring up the settings menu where it shows your teammates with the dog tags, if I'm not mistaken, also shows how many eliminations everyone has.
I'm sorry you got downvoted. I thought it was funny
Yeah I still shake like hell when it's down to single digits in survivors
I'm pretty sure a majority of reddit is white people as well, sooo
This is probably the most beautiful thing I've ever seen

Anyone know how he died? Suicide? Car accident? Not trying to disrespect, just curious.

They have a statement out on the mojang website that they're still reviewing issues from January 4th because of the flood of messages
Thanks, I have contacted them an hour or two ago. 

Millions of dollars... But has so many messages they have to respond to, shouldn't that be telling them something?
No, it says I must migrate to a mojang account on the launcher.

I wish I was smackin some booty for free tf
"aw yeah! I came in 98th!"

At least you admit to your mistakes

Yes I understand this, but can't he just go to Best buy or some shit and buy it himself?
Just so you know, it is not 1 in 4 girls are raped, that is a false statistic (in the U.S. at least).

Edit: phrasing
I hope the tuck does a segment on this

Because he's in college and is legally allowed to buy rated M games, but his parents say it's too violent like he's 10 years old or something. That's how it sounds to me at least. I respect my parents one hunnid percent but they couldn't give less of a shit what games I play. I think he's being downvoted because he won't go buy it himself, and is instead asking his parents to buy it, even though he's complaining about it.

What if they do it on purpose because they know there's people near you to kill you? I say it should be ricochet and if your teammate shoots you, it directly damages them instead of you, or just no damage done to teammates at all.
Or keep it plugged in or charge it when it's on low battery

You said:

>It's not fair. You can spectate them and provide a second set of eyes in a solo game.

To me, this implied you meant that if I were to spectate my friend I would be able to move his perspective for myself, looking behind him for anyone coming. Other than that, if it's what he's seeing, it's not really anything special or unfair.
That's because COD matches are insignificant and short lived, and people usually leave to join their friends (I know I do).

>if it was a good feature they would’ve added it.

doesn't mean shit. A lot of games probably don't have "good" features that you'd like them to have, so by your logic those "good" features aren't good. Again, it's just a quality-of-life thing, just because it's not their biggest priority doesn't mean it's not good.

OP means when you load up the game and see your friend playing a match then he would just like to spectate instead of starting a match by himself (which could be for various reasons).
....yeah? People already do that in duos/squads when they die and they spectate their friends. There's literally zero downsides to this being added, it's just a quality of life feature.
#SMALL TIDDY PUNK GFS 2018
It isn't a feature. OP wants it to be. Spectating your friend is common practice among games like LoL and others.
It's just a quality of life feauture. We aren't saying that spectating your friend should be their top priority.

I'm not exactly sure why you're against this idea, it's not like you have to spectate your friend, it's just a nice option.
It's just an interesting stat to see. Knowing how many times you've won, or how much time you have in the game isn't "useful," but it's nice to see.
That isn't an option for everyone
Spectating in this game means you don't have any control, you only see what the person you're spectating sees. Have you played this game at all?
I'm pretty new to this game (had it for like 5 or 6 days) but I picked up pretty quickly. I played squads with only my friend and I and the rest for fill for the first time today, and one of my teammates actually murdered me as soon as I opened a supply drop and got a legendary AR, so that was pretty sad. I'm not sure why people do that, it's pretty selfish really.

My friend and I also witnessed our squad mate killing another random squad mate so we killed that squad mate because he targeted us after.

Agreed though, they should be punished. (NA btw)

I as well am a prestige per day played. For BO3 I was a 15h per prestige, but in most other CODs it's per day. In this game at the beginning it was 15h, but now it's a day.

Not sure why it doesn't work then.
Yes. WWII's system is more consumer friendly than BO3's imo.
Gain credits slowly > get impatient > buy supply drops

That's not the problem, the problem is that they can get your information and use it for other purposes
I was thinking about this too, but I think they would've done this had it not been that this would be an easy way to get armory credits. They probably want to make it harder to earn credits fast, encouraging buying supply drops
+5 per second? How about +100 every 10 seconds, isn't that how it was in bo3?

No, they're spraying at people
I mean it's different from sitting in the back of the map, as you mentioned, because maps and gameplay are different. Idk, the playstyle of the sniper in COD hasn't really changed much since 2007, just run around quickscoping people
Sniping has been a different role altogether in cod compared to other games like battlefield.
Really? For me it's just a bunch of people standing around and others spraying in the firing range
That's me
There's no way people like that still exist
You're probably one of those kids who raised the standards from 720 suis on carrier to 1440s on carentan which is why the trickshotting and sniping community is dead
I think it's gotten like this because they were like "send us feedback" and they actually listen to us so people will complain about the smallest shit. The HQ button being there is just something we'll get used to.

Yeah but you won't get the update for 8 months

Yeah I wasn't hating on Ghosts at all, I was including it in that golden age era. I love Ghosts, but after that it was somewhat downhill. BO3 was fine tho.
At least we got that cleared up

Priorities +100
In [Birdman's video](https://youtu.be/LVBX1eT2ZA8) he suggested that Condrey makes a poll on his Twitter so that it's public, and only one vote per person. Condrey won't do it, because as a previous post has said, SHG is that person that can't accept they're wrong. Obviously +100 would win, and Condrey knows this, but would refuse to do it because he wants it at +50 for some reason.
Thank you
BO2 was great (and my favorite) except for it's awful lag compensation (same with BO3). I really hope Treyarch gets REAL 60hz servers that they deserve.
Less than 1 year at that. Remember the era before Ghosts when 3arc and IW only had 1 year? They didn't have NEARLY as many problems as this game on their releases.

Edit: yes sorry, I meant 2 years, not 1. It was 2 AM when I wrote this haha. Also not hating on Ghosts, I was including it in that era of good games (I liked it).
Where tf do you live then?
BO3 is old, I do not recommend spending $100 on supply drops, but you can choose to spend your money how you want to, that's not up to me. But 2 years to hit master prestige? It takes a little less than a month to hit MP. It really isn't that hard to hit.
IW is probably dead af now tho since WWII came out
$500mil within first 3 days and they don't even hire someone for communications
At first I didn't mind it but now it's just super annoying that they haven't bothered to fix it yet
For real though. They could actually do some funny/clever stuff with some of the names, but most of them are just the "hey" or "yes!" emote with different names.
I didn't even know they removed that! I just hadn't cared yet (too early in the game) to check how many for each medal I got. I like checking at some points and being like "wow, I have THAT many bloodthirsties/headshots/etc.?!"
"he will not divide us" yeah he won't, because you are.
Yeah that seems to make sense. Thanks! (Bad design choice on SHG's part though)
Source? Or is this off of experience? It definitely explains it, but I just want to be sure
I got a 5 man with the thompson and the play of the game was a dude getting a single kill and the slow mo was after he killed the guy, too.

Yeah no dude. Apparently it only works on Xbox from OP's edited comment. He most likely doesn't have the game on any other platform so how could he know it doesn't work on anything else?

Of course this game is slower, that's why they have XP boots in the supply drops, so they bait you to buy more supply drops. They probably won't increase the XP rate anytime.
They already do penalize you: you get a loss if you leave. No one gives a shit though. People will still leave even if it's a penalty where you can't play for 10 minutes, etc.

The reason teachers do that is because they can't teach the class anymore, they have to teach the test (more specifically, the final exam, which is a standardized test by the state).
When people say that you only lived until you were 30 years old in the middle ages. This stems from figures that are **averages** of lifespan during those times, which was in the 30s, which was because infant mortality brought that average number down. In reality, those who lived past their teens made it well past 30 years old usually.

No it is not. They are going to implement microtransactions back into the game at a later date and squeeze everyone's money out of them. A real apology would've have been honest and included them NOT putting microtransactions back into the game unless they specified "for cosmetic purposes ONLY." This is not a real apology.
It's the new choker style, duh

My theory is that they hyped the game up by supporting the community, etc. and then when they game came out and they made bank they didn't have to care about shit.

No. I don't even know why we call black people "African-American" anyway. The country and then "-American" refers to a direct immigrant. My heritage is Sicilian (and German and English) but I don't call myself Sicilian-American, I call myself American (...or white) because I was born HERE. And not all blacks are African, so really we should just be calling them black or Americans.

I assume Cyanogenmod supports Note 3 for Android 7.0 Nougat. Not sure about 8.0 Oreo tho, since that isn't even released by Samsung yet (only stock devices get it right now, Samsung takes like 6 months to release). I highly recommend doing research about rooting and what you download. Make sure your model version matches the root. For example, my S7 model number is SM-G930V, so I would get an SM-G930V root for android <insert version here>.

Edit: personally I'd recommend rooting to get stock android, rather than samsung hardware, unless you use your note capabilities. If you use your note features, I have no idea if those transfer when you root to a newer version of Samsung's Android versions, I'd research that if I were you.
Note 3 isn't supported anymore and hasn't received an official update from Google to have Google Assistant. Google Now voice command is pretty much the same tho

You can disable bloatware apps or root it toot it. Personally I never install the Facebook app. If I have to use it I go into the phone browser or go on my computer.
Honestly I don't care if someone hates Trump or not, but the people here usually have a valid argument for both sides. We make fun of the people who don't, and that's who you see hit the front page. It's not really about the politics, it's more of the radical idiots.
They didn't fit in especially since TH10's theme was red and those walls were electric blue... Too contrasting.

The CIA and FBI requested to not release certain pages, that's why.
I've seen some [removed] comments already. I'm sure they're removing things that aren't true.

Edit: tbh I have no idea. Most of the removed comments are by an automod for being against trump to prevent brigading. I'm sure if something weren't true, someone from outside the sub would call out that person for it.
I do!

Yeah but people used to sell ipods and iphones with it. Can't download an apk on an apple device (because "apk" is "android package").

I had default, but then just made everything higher quality, it doesn't matter what settings I have, it just crashes when I hit slow motion. It's a shame, the HDR+ is really nice, but I can just use the default Samsung camera app for slow motion if I ever do it (I've used slow mo only once out of a year)

My phone is more expensive than the respective iPhone. I don't see why apple users have a 2011 mentality. We have a lot better, more expensive, and well built (most better than iphones) phones, for the past couple years too.

I did, and there was (imo) a noticeable [positive] difference, but it still wasn't like 60hz. I don't think they used the 60hz for the beta, or it was just something wrong with the game that they'll fix on launch.

The servers' connection, essentially. For context, most CODs are 10-20hz servers, while most popular games are like 45+, and you definitely notice the connection difference. You don't get shot around corners in BF, Overwatch, and CSGO.

That means it'll take 100 days though, which is over 3 months.
I think it should just be like 1-3 unlock tokens that you get to choose which DLC weapons you want. Honestly I don't think they'll make much money after WWII comes out so this probably wouldn't hurt them.

Maybe 1 token per 20 wins (60 wins max for 3 tokens) or something? And if you buy it you get 3? Idk just brainstorming
D E E P
Thanks
I wasn't blaming your connection. IW and MWR have better servers than BO3. It doesn't matter how good your connection is, everyone will experience lag compensation.

Edit: and we all also experience the little lag skip every once in a while.

Edit 2: throughout today the servers have seem to get increasingly worse... hmm
I know this might seem like "futuristic bullshit" or whatever, but I really like that purple lightning pre-order camo for zombies. Maybe that could be the dark matter of this game? Idk, but I'm sure SHG has something sick for us regardless.
Why do you bold **e**v**e**ry **e**?
Your comment triggered me because you used "you're" instead of "your"
They need millions a day to feed themselves
Yeah, you lose gun fights you should 100% win because of lag compensation (which has been in COD since the first multiplayer COD), not because of your internet. What are the servers, like 10-15hz? Too many people rely on lag compensation, and I'm so glad WWII is gonna have 60hz.

EDIT: formatting
Yeah that's true. I haven't put much time into MWR but I do get dupes sometimes, but a lot of content is still to be unlocked for me.
They stop supporting after two years so they can focus on releasing/promoting their game for the entire year. Take SHG and AW for example, they stopped supporting their game after Infinite Warfare came out, right? Then focused this year on promoting and getting the beta out. That's what Treyarch will be doing (idk about beta but it's likely) in 2018.

EDIT: They also released the Grand Slam. As in, a big way to go out.
That was pretty aggressive. Also,

>I didn't say anything of the sort about the alt-right

>It's a /pol/ parroting ground for kids who like Alt-Right rhetoric
mmmmm that was kinda out there. I'm not denying it but that was a bit out of the blue. Also, that isn't science, that's a sociological study.

That was total victory, not triple played. If it was triple played you would've been guarenteed 1 ranged weapon. GS is 1 guarenteed no dupe ranged weapon, so you won't leave empty handed like you did on your mental-torture-of-a-contract total victory
BO3 was a sweatfest before the grand slam.

I wish they just gave us unlock tokens. 125 wins to end everything off is a slap in the face imo, because they want you to pay for it instead of going through that mental torture
