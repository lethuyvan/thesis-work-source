oh I was thinking of SVP 4 for the artifacting I don't know much about Kodi or DSPlayer
definitely make sure you select animation or live(whatever they call it) cause other wise you get weird artifacting 


then I would say with that high of specs turn the slider all the way up, make sure madVR is enabled in MCP and I think you should be good sorry I'm a little drunk right now, if that made no sense

I also recommend SVP 4 for that sexy frame rate bump

I'm debating using Arch with the Unity DE
Ubuntu 17.10 is kinda slow for me, compared to 16.x and I hate how they moved things that didn't need to be moved 
never mind I'm blind you have the neofetch right there
Are you running this all on Ubuntu?
as do I, except I'm lactose intolerant so I'm a fake Wiscoooonsinite
https://discord.gg/EN46EGJ

Here's a link to the Team 7 discord!
yeah I was just mentioning how many times ive had to reinstall ubuntu, I can do this part flawlessly (now that I jinxed it)
yeah Ubuntu has its own partition so I'll just have to do a fresh install, a little annoying cause I had a test install too on a whole other drive, so this will be my third time installing Ubuntu lol
I started with Ubuntu dual booted with Windows 10, then tried to add KDE later
I ran this, and then rebooted for it to take effect (hope that didnt break anything) and now some things are Kubuntu like the boot logo and the mouse cursor, and it didnt update Im still on 16.04.3
I'd like to master it and speed run it so I can get good before I enjoy it yk
I certainly will, thanks again!
Ive got it working now, thanks.
thank you so much, it was really giving me troubles and I couldnt find much on the forums either. You get all my upvotes lol.

I ran autoremove after that and that seemed to clear all the errors, now I'm not sure how to update to 17.x

alright that got rid of it, should I try updating ubuntu now, the error in the top bar went away
this took a while, the final output was

Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS x86_64
steam has a linux version you know, I play games like Hacknet, Life is Strange, and Slime Rancher, just to name a few I have, I know Tomb Raider can also run on Linux
I was stuck on partioning hard drives, fdisk didnt want to work for me 
Indirectly he has murdered 
he watches over us!
to be fair you have to be very intelligent to grasp the concept of Arch
YES YES YES YES
Yuri is third best but I'd still play
I had to fix some other issues with my install now I'm all good
yeah I know about ricing and stuff too, and that's really good to know when distro hopping but idk where to start changing desktop environments and stuff on my own. I think that's why most newer users just change distros cuz it's easier 
typo, now I'm on mobile and about to go sleep, might change it later 
Maybe I'm blind, maybe Im stupid, thank you, something that rhymes with stupid.
yeah

nvm I found the readme, well kinda of, just the install directions on their website, that I glossed over before.
all I have is the SH file and when I open that gedit crashes
I've moved onto accepting I'll start with Ubuntu but now I'm stuck on how to install tar.gz packages, I have the .sh file extracted and now I'm lost 
oh wow thanks, totally forgot about pc part picker. this is actually really helpful for finding an exact one he likes!
He can settle for another 2TB one, what could we find on those?
so I have this written down and I have no clue how to use it 

I just used

    apt-et install --fix-broken

honestly didnt expect it to work but it did and its GLORIOUS everything works now 
however still when I launch it it sits at the grey screen and doesnt appear to do anything :(
I installed the snap version
its giving me an error "The package system is broken"
the application shop thing for Ubuntu seems broken, as it crashes when I try to do anything that way, it wants to do a bunch of updates that keep failing.
Wow that looks like a cluster fuck I'm sorry I tried to format it nicely but Reddit didnt like that idea.
I wanted to feel special and be part of the meme, I use Arch btw (if I didn't suck)
would Slackware be any better?

the webm version of this with *doki doki* **BOOOOOOOOMMM** is the fucking best meme 
apple sheep are just as bad, me included 
it's triggering me IF YOU DONT STOP THAT RIGHT NOW rrrrrgh you... I could never be mad at you~ 
it is kind of odd but idk why people are so triggered, take upvotes for your troubles 
that's fair, I know some commands for Linux, enough to get around. I'm most familiar with messing with raspberry pis 
tbh half of it is from attempting the Arch install and the other half is from playing Hacknet, but I got pretty far into Arch before giving up, I was past partitioning the hard drive but then weird stuff kept happening 
yeah I can use the terminal, in fact I can barely use the windows powershell or whatever anymore cuz I know all the commands for Linux now
yeah I guess I havn't looked that deep into it, Im downloading Manjaro at the moment but I'm probably gonna end up with some version of Ubuntu
yeah I hate how ugly cinnamon is, thats my only problem
but yeah, I'll look into something a bit easier to install like Ubuntu, I dislike Mint for anything but hard drive recovery which now I use Hiren's anyways for that
I was looking at openbox and saw something about Gentoo, that's why I had the dumbass idea of installing it in the first place.
I'll try this out once I get more used to the whole using Linux thing. Keeping it bookmarked for now though.
sadly I'm not, I just kinda stared at my live CD until someone pointed out I know less than I thought
damn that was fast, I'll check out Manjaro since you said it first.
wholesome people get no where on youtube, but I still admire it.
I'd say LinuxMasterRace but I just prefer anything but Windows 8-10 honestly
I feel that, mostly you think it's the eyes, but sometimes its face shape, nose position, ect. It's hard to get faces exactly right, especially in your own eyes.

Yeah its only been like 2 or 3 years but it feels a lot longer tbh I didn't think about it much.
you have Auto-Capitolization turned off in settings? Cause that fixed it for my girlfriend. Idk it's such a weird bug, effecting iOS 10 even like how does that happen?
I'm on 11.2 and never had this bug I even went out of my way to use default settings and still didn't get this glitch, odd
just turn off auto cap not correction all together, never had this bug just know iOS inside and out
Cant find much for mac but that might just be me, really helpful though considering I just started messing with stuff like windows 98 in a virtual machine
this website is actually really fun to go through all the stuff on there. I love archives like this, thank you.

I would use Malwarebytes for virus type things and something like GlassWire (pirated) to monitor your internet usage a bit closer. Im not sure about GlassWire since it kinda annoyed me after a while but something similar to that would help.
I value love far above sex and we both love each other so I would take her over being able to have sex ever or on a regular basis. 
We actually just discussed this, how she will think about it and we can always talk about it.
at first she wanted to but now she is sort of rethinking that. Which then it feels like it falls back to me to do this. She's really uncertain about stuff usually and this isnt an exception.
old DSi I reset so it had no parental blocking. Then hid it under my bed. I was 11.
We've talked stuff over and we are going out to dinner tonight to talk it over more in person so that we can kinda come to an understanding so neither of us feel defective. 
thanks, this really means alot to me.
that is so not cool dude!

awh.. this needs so many more upvotes imo
how do I make this viral I love this so much 
fuck it, i’ll do it myself!
y’all are awesome thanks!!
Sadly its both, I worded this really poorly, I have to destroy it to move it and I was wondering if anyone else had done this and was able to rebuild it later from the Fabricator.
My man!
That's why I use a killswitch if my VPN cuts out for some reason.

I just went through it with Notepad++ and it only wanted to change stuff for the product so I let it do that, and it worked perfect. Thanks for the tip!

Thanks, you too. Another tip for getting around your ISP tracking stuff is to always delete your .torrent files. Seeding is nice if you have a kill switch on your VPN but its also a way for ISPs to catch you off guard.
with PIA its $40 a year ($3 a month) which was a pretty good deal in my mind, but if you want to pay that monthly pretty sure its 6 dollars a month.
Well don't use a free one, especially Betternet, they give your information to your isp immediately even with premium, found that out the hard way. I've been recommended many times to use PIA so I finally did, its affordable and works amazing, and perfect speeds, a little faster than I used to have with out it actually.

I've had my second warning, started using a VPN about a week ago, hope it works. Youre ahead of me man.

Yeah honestly i gave up on religion when my parents attempted to shove it down my throat every day and beat me
The Emoji Movie, need i explain more?
Thanks
Thanks this seems really helpful I'll check it out once I have time
yeah if I look for my IP when it's enabled I get a different one than my actual one. So that's strange that they sent the warning then. Unless they are really really slow because I started using this VPN about 3 weeks ago, and I've pirated before that.
Yeah I always have it running in the background 
Ive been using BetterNet should I switch to something more reliable? or would they cancel my contract if they see a new VPN up
I bet you could find a similar keygen as to preinstalled situations that you could make sure there wasn't spyware in
I just have a Windows 7 iso that has it preinstalled to work as a key gen in the background ever 45 days or so
