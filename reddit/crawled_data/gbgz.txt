It is weird, I have a message history since February 2017 (changed phones and chat was not backed up), but the graph does not seem to be plotted correctly. [Example](https://imgur.com/VKBELC8)

My text format was different than yours, so I had to use a text editor and Excel to switch it into a workable format. The total messages seem to be ok, but I wonder if I messed up with the dates in any way (even though it does not seem so by checking the file).
Then it is the same system. What makes it work is if the mods actually control manga readers.
I am a manga reader and I agree.  I don't remember some details and I want to remember them by watching the anime. It is hard when there are so many comments hyping this and that. 

It would be nice for mods to manage the subreddit as /r/shingekinokyojin, where no manga readers can comment on the anime onlies thread, or they face the ban hammer.
You shouldn't compare a non-flagship phone like the Fascinate to an iPhone, you're comparing pears and apples (heh). Besides, at that point in time I'll admit Android was not at it's strongest, 2.2 was very basic and the interface was admittedly ugly.
In Mexico we are going through tax filing season and it is exactly what you described, if the income properly generated an invoice. You access a webpage, validate the amounts shown to you and if you agree with them, click and the process is finished. Personal deductions can be easily entered and in 5 days an ETF is sent if there is any tax return.

IIRC, starting this year people with a single source of income don't even have to do their taxes, it is completely optional though. Still not the smartest thing to do, as less taxes can be paid if you do it.
Ah, the ol'... forget it, linking to the last post is hell on mobile.
This could be the pride and accomplishment EA has been talking about.
Yeah, it happened to me too, I started reading about all of them. At least in the Dahmer and Gacy cases, there was a lot of abuse throughout their childhood, so it provides some context into why they started to behave like that. It is a damn shame, as the three of them were very smart and probably could have done great things if they dedicated their energy towards good.

Anyway, here is the [link to the comment in the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/8c6xpp/_/dxcqwy9?context=1000).
I know why, yesterday there was an /r/askreddit thread about creepiest public declassified documents and one of the top comments was about the police files from the Dahmer case.

I also read the entire article and some of the statement.
Hadn't heard about the disease. Still, doing a quick read, it says you'd only get the disease if the brain was already infected. Not all brain eating leads to going insane and die, apparently.

I hope the police will be able to do something. Also, I'm not entirely sure if Microsoft will assist as well as it does in the US, customer service is usually of lower quality in Mexico.
I was about to include a rant about Xbox not having a more precise way of locating it, but then I thought that it would probably be a PR nightmare for MS due to privacy issues. Also, what would stop someone from selling a console and continue to track the buyer? I guess something can be done, but it is probably not as easy as including a GPS tracker.
Already did that, I hope they can do something with it.
Thanks! Will check around for pawn shops. I do have my Serial number, I got it before removing the device from my account. The thing is, I'm not sure pawn shops will be willing to cooperate, I guess I'll ask my brother to "shop" around.
It can only be Tatsunootoshigo or Beaver Warrior.
Thanks! I have also seen decks with only two REZ, but I'm not entirely sure why. I feel 3 allows me to pop more frequently Gozuki's effect adequately, when I tried with 2 most of the time REZ immediately went to the GY. Still, I might try using wyvern again, I got it out as in my experience it does not have a good synergy with Zombie card effects. Is there maybe something I'm doing wrong?
Thank you! Seeing I got two suggestions to drop WoD, this was the first card out. Dropped AMA and added Storm also.  

Unfortunately I am still in Platinum, so I haven't matched up a lot this season against those decks (used to play AG, trying to avoid it as skill will be nerfed). I mostly have met variants of burn  (including Bamboozle Sprite cancer) and +20 card decks that ruin my streaks. That said, I'll see how well SRH behaves, but probably won't use it a lot until I get to Legend.
I had been playing with 1 less Gozuki and another Samurai Skull until yesterday. Have been experimenting using Zombie World instead of Storm or 1 less Insight (can be bricky at times having 3). ZW was kind of situational so I dropped it.

Also played another version with Bonz and Straight to the Grave and an additional Storm, but I found most times REZDs attack was not enough, so I went back to Beatdown.
When you multitask out of the app it disappears. Close the app and open it again and it should be there.

Yeah, so much it is ridiculous. It will not attack it even if there is no zombie monster in the Graveyard. If I spot a Gozuki, I immediately turn off Auto Duel and obliterate it myself.

If Kaizaki and Hishiro told each other about being subjects, would that trigger the "virus"? Or would it be something that Relife staff have to do manually when they realize someone else knows they're a subject? Cause if they became aware they're both subjects, they could possibly come up with a solution.
Can I get it too?
Original Japanese is not Saiyan, it is Saiyajin, hence the SSJ.
In the manga it is stated that Beerus has that ability, even if he has trouble controlling it. It is not a transformation and it is not exclusive to the saiyans (in the anime it is said that it is hard to achieve even among gods)
It's really sad I just found out about the rewatch, as I started rewatching FMA03 on october 1st in order for my girlfriend to be introduced to FMA. She has liked it so far, we are almost up to episode 25 so I can't stop her now in order to go along with the rewatch.

Anyways, on to the episode. I know Al is portrayed as a character that tries his hardest to trust in people and this is taken almost to a ridiculous level with Psiren. I have mixed feelings about this, I know it is mainly done for comedic purposes and it kind of achieves it, but I feel they sacrifice the character's credibility.

Regarding Ed's boob groping, I really dislike it as I feel it does not fit FMA at all, there's no need at all for fanservice. It happens often in anime and is something that pushes away potential viewers when it is not done for a reason that enrichens the plot.  

The episode is not that fresh in my mind right now to remember any other details, but I will start to rewatch daily so I can continue posting my comments.
I don't think that was her, that user name and timestamp seems to be set by the webpage/system.

When Melascula was reduced to a snake, it was probably a homage to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and the final fate of Envy. It seems natural that 7DS would reference it, as both deal with the seven deadly sins (in a very different way, though).

Actually, that scene is way more brutal on the original FMA. The first 20 chapters or so develop characters much more in the original.

Guess in FMA:B they assumed people watched the original, as they skipped a lot.
Substep 2 of damage step, 3rd bullet. I think an applicable example would be Mystical Beast of Serket without having Temple of Kings on the field.

That was not a joke, that was just racist and not even culturally correct.
You could have researched a name first or, you know, not comment at all.
They do have planes, they made Titans rain with them.
What is really interesting to me is that Ymir's Titan teeth are different from the flashbacks. From what I have seen, those details are always intentional, but I have no idea what that means. But it probably is related to eating Marcel.
That is really interesting, how the first shifters came to be? Right now we don't know anything more about them other than their ability to shift.
I think they were. Remember Eren was a kid when Shiganshina was attacked. That would mean Bertholdt and Reiner also were kids at that time, and they turned into Titans and wrecked things up.

During this episode they were teenagers, so at least we know Reiner and Bertholdt were already shifters. The only one that is not confirmed is Annie.
We don't have any evidence Reiner's friend was a shifter, but from what we saw from this episode, 3 of 4 of that group are shifters. It may very well be a possibility that he was a shifter.

Having said that, I'm not sure eating a shifter is what makes them human (or also shifters?)
They don't mean that pod, they mean the one that appears in Broly's movie.
That's exactly it. I try to clear them every few days, but quick Google searches always pile them up again.
Thanks for the suggestion. Hadn't heard before of that app.
Thanks for the suggestion! I actually now how to circumvent this, but it does not make Facebook any less of an asshole. Why do I have to do all that work (I know it's not a lot, but it's annoying) or download a third party app for them? I usually just check messages on my laptop.
You can deny permissions, but not at the granularity shown by /u/RaymondLawrence. It allows you to block camera, contacts, location, etc. to the app.
Don't want or like the app. Also, the design is very assholish, so it fits this sub. If I'm using their site, why do I also have to use their app?
I just recently cleared them, sorry I have so few open.
Yes, and both of them are crap. I deleted them because they were sucking up all my battery. Messenger specially is an offender as it wanted to know all my SMS info and be my default app.
Yes.
For a moment I was really confused, I misread AT as the Attack Titan haha.
That is the way I think and also why I started to watch anime. Usually not more than 12 episodes of 20 minutes. Also, Stranger Things had a pretty neat story and an interesting production.
Such a shame.
I'd say, at least with these pictures, that you look great. Maybe you can provide clearer pictures. By the way, check out /r/skincareaddiction, it could help you continue looking great.
He doesn't open the door of time. Ganondorf obtains the triforce of power during [his execution during Twilight Princess](https://youtu.be/ksHrg_tSGqw?t=1m30s). The sages describe it as a divine prank.
> But Gorons aren't on the same intellectual level. I mean, they eat rocks.

Laughed very audibly at this. You get my upvote.
Not saying this is or isn't gaslighting, but minimizing your reactions is essentially the same, it's trying to invalidate what you're saying.
Then what will the movie be about without the clown terrorizing kids?
I used 11KC38NFTQJ3GDEMB41B31R, but I got a message that the purchase failed. Any time I press the remove ads button, I get the same message.
The way to verify that claim would be to take the SIM out, turn the phone off with a full battery and monitor your network traffic. No SIM means no way to communicate using mobile data, so the only remaining option would be WiFi.
One Punch Man releases manga episodes whenever they are ready. The author takes his time, sometimes taking months to release a chapter. Besides he usually does redraws, in order to improve previous chapters while working on new ones.

Attack on Titan has a monthly schedule, being released roughly on the 6th of every month. Also, chapters tend to be about 40 pages long.

In both cases, they take enough time to produce a superior product.
Mexican here too. Of course not, flautas are always made with corn tortillas. Have been to most states and I have never seen flautas with flour tortilla. 

Haven't been to Tijuana though. Maybe they are done that way there, but from what I heard its culture is more similar to the Mexican culture in the US.
Looks like Kristen Bell.
Hey Taylor! Lately your videos have become my ASMR favorites, I hope you will continue for a long time. Keep up the good work.

I'd like to ask you, how do you explain what you do to other people? What are the reactions you get to it? I mean, in real life. I imagine it must get interesting.
You're right, he is correct. I went from his 36,500 and took it as hours, not days. Did not read the part of his assumption being 36500 for 100 days. It was instantly clear for me once you put it that way haha, sorry OP.
And you are welcome to believe it. Any proof of it?
But you are dividing hours/(days/year)which does not yield any intelligible unit of time (hours*days/year). You could divide hours/(hours/day), which would give you days (25.35). 

Or if you really want it in years, it should be hours/(hours/year), which is 306.33/8,760 and the result is 0.035 years.
Why did you divide 608.33 by 365? What does that result mean? I would have divided by 24 so you would get the number of real days Link was asleep, which is 25.34.
I'm not sure if they used math magic or it was found out by magic historians.
Used to not think a lot of her acting, but after seeing her in [Between Two Ferns](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=Hhj9B2hymBw&t=3m41s) as a guest, I just couldn't stand her
 She tries so hard to be funny acting like she is drunk and the whole thing is really cringy. Maybe it is a stupid reason, but I can't stand her acting at all after watching that. I always see her trying so hard.

That being said, hate would be a strong word. I just feel uncomfortable with her acting lol.
Huh, seems I misread what you wrote. I read "I am not dumb", not "Am I not dumb".  All I can say now is, am I not dumb lol.
If you know it is a tweet then what is your question to OP? Seems you already know the answer.
Says the homeless hobo.
Except gods are also mortals. Remember Zamasu had to wish for immortality.
Each universe does not have different timelines, but each timeline has several universes. It is not entirely clear in the anime, but in the manga Zamasu travelled from timeline to timeline to find one where he could carry on his plan. 

He lands into Trunks' timeline as Supreme Kai was killed there in the "Buu saga" (the equivalent in that timeline), so Beerus also disappeared. Whis is dormant without a god of destruction, so didn't do anything after Beerus disappeared. Then, Black Goku proceeds to go into every universe of that timeline and kill every Supreme Kai.

Edit: Found it, it is [chapter 16](http://www3.mangafreak.net/Read1_Dragon_Ball_Super_16_1). In case you do not read mangas, it is read from top to bottom, right to left.

Also, in case you do not care to read the entire chapter, here is the particular page that would explain the point.[Death of Supreme Kai (Trunks' Timeline)](http://i.imgur.com/tBdvNqJ.jpg)
For a moment it reminded me of a [goal by Dueñas](https://youtu.be/UrBACca36fE?t=2m48s), though it is not quite the same when rewatching it. Still great though.
I'd say #14 and #15 suit you the best.
Knowing the US government, they probably don't trust you and are testing if you'll tell the truth. I mean, owing money there to the IRS is a bigger crime than murder.
That way it makes more sense. Even though you are changing the rules, as the reason for failure in each of the other frames is the lack of communication. In the 6th frame, the lack of communication is the result, not the root cause.
I was joking with that comment, but I'd challenge that idea. Lack of documentation is usually due to lack of time, not considering it important, laziness but not lack of communication. One could argue that not considering it important may come from not communicating the value of it, but that is almost never the case. People just don't like documentation lol.
Except the 6th frame, which documents nothing at all
I was really hopeful I was going to be able to play with Japanese VA, but I guess that just ends the dream. I could switch my console to Japanese, but I'm not so sure I would be able to get past the first instructions.

1. My favorite character is Ganondorf by far, and also happens to be my main. I think I'd have no issue at all.

3. My favorite Pokemon is Dragonite, but Charizard comes pretty close. Every time I have played with Charizard I have sucked, so I'd have to get some practice.
How did she find out?  That must have been a real problem haha.
Yeah, that was my first thought as I watched the episode. I thought he was going to cut Wraith's throat, for pushing the idea of ABI going into porn.
Em, by asking nicely to whitelist the website? 
I'm not saying he doesn't, but if he states he uses the money for the site to be paid by itself he's kind of shooting himself in the foot. I would have gladly turned off my adblocker if I determined the site was safe. This is more about a "you had a chance and blew it away" attitude.
It is very valuable to know what people search for, how they search for it, how many sites will they visit before giving up on a search and starting a new one and more. This allows a website to optimize its position in a search engine and drive more traffic to them.
I could, but I'm not really that desperate for his solution.
Actually that's the first thing I did after seeing that message, whitelist them. Then I realized they really meant banning me. Oh well, there are other tools available.
It seems to be an IP ban. Once I accessed the website my co-workers were no longer able to use it, regardless of browser. 
Oh, then it seems I'm not the first to out them (him?) on reddit. Sounds salty as fuck.
What he did to you is awful and you should not feel ashamed or responsible in any way. You flirting with him does not give him the right to do what he did. It is a sexual assault, there is no other way to call it. You should be careful around this person, he could try you go even further without your consent (he has already proven so).

Also, for future reference, I'd recommend you to be careful when sending nudes through Snapchat. There are ways to save the pictures without the sender knowing.
I'd say that Milk has no place being derived from Basket. Basket can have an add method and it should receive an object to add.

Curious thing, it doesn't happen all the time. First time I clicked it blinked, then it was random (as far as I could observe).
I think the best Android feature isn't the ability to modify it, but the app sharing capabilities and notification handling.  Mainly the share feature, I can use any app I like for any file/web page, instead of being forced into a single app. If it has not changed, iOS only sharing features are to Facebook, Twitter, email and printer, which are not really useful if I want to share from Reddit to Pushbullet, for example.

I also love the app drawer, having only what I use frequently on screen.

The use of the back button is also invaluable to me, but I can live without it.
¿Dónde está mi perrito? 

Sí, ahí estudié. Curiosamente estaba mucho más fresa el ambiente que en el Tec, porque cerca del 90% veníamos de colegios. Ahorita creo que ya se balanceó, dado que dan oportunidad de entrar a estudiantes que no saben previamente inglés, pero que son excelentes académicamente.

Dejando de lado esa parte, dado que no es académico, tuve excelentes profesores en el CIDEB. El detalle es que la administración, sistema y la exigencia esperada de la escuela complican el aprovechamiento. Algunos de mis maestros de ahí también dan clases en el Tec, y sin falta comentan que los alumnos terminan mucho mejor preparados de su clase en el Tec, a pesar de ser material similar y el mismo profesor.
Yo diría que vale bastante la pena. Aunque es cierto que puedes salir adelante en donde sea, en el Tec puedes explotar tu potencial más eficientemente. Yo estudié la preparatoria en la UANL y mi carrera en el Tec y de verdad no hay comparación (a pesar de que estudié en la mejor prepa de de la UANL). Si te lo tomas en serio, te dará una excelente formación. 
Works for me in latest public version.

He is an industrial designer, he did mention the video card is the one he used for CAD and 3D modeling. I can probably get a lower price from him. The issue I have buying online, are the increased prices for international shipping and the import taxes unfortunately.

Considering the video card is for a workstation, is it not suitable at all for gaming?

Thank you for your reply. I read the whole thread, and someone said that the frame is different for each model. Some of the sites I'm browsing don't specify the model, just that it is for a Galaxy S4 (those are ~$80, and the ones that state specifically the one I need are ~$100). How can I know if the ones without a model will fit my i9500?

Good advice. I'm actually looking to do very subtle things that may make him question whether he did them or not. Not something as obvious as changing a wallpaper, which we did discuss haha. Also, we're more of a team and there would be no repercussions as someone getting fired or in trouble.

¿De cuáles elecciones a Presidente hablas? Porque si es de las últimas estarías contradiciendo lo que mencionas, ya que la candidata del PAN vagamente se acercó con un 22% en las del 2012, quedando como primero el PRI con 37% y el PRD en segundo con 33% me parece.

Y en el 2006 fue algo parecido, ganó el PAN con 36, el PRD tuvo 35% y el PRI 22%.
I don't really care about reselling them, I like using them. I do it in order to keep them preserved. Holding them? I don't use them as an action figure that I would need to hold them. Until I have time to build a stand, they will stay in their boxes.
I just cut through the bottom of the box and removed the sticker that blocks the NFC. I am able to use them while keeping them in their boxes.
I just clicked it and it went away.
It would be cool, but I doubt it would happen. All characters come from the timeline where Link went back to the past in OoT (MM will appear, TP), and also from SS as it is common to all timelines. WW is part of the adult timeline, and the art style also makes it difficult. But one can hope.
