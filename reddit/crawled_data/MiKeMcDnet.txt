It used to be that the FDA would certify a piece of equipment once completely configured as a certified medical device.  Then hackers found all these unpatched Windows XP boxes with medical peripherals attached and popped them boxes.  FDA changed their stance, but support from some manufacturers keep claiming that you will lose support if you patch.  (damned if you do damned if you dont for expensive equipment)

Most hospitals are slow to update because they fear reprisal from their physicians who cannot deal with change.  Anything that slows down how a physician works, is seen as a detriment to the organisation. 
You listen to your vendors a bit too eagerly.  Don't believe the "FDA certified" smoke they are blowing up your ass.  Patch your shit regularly, or enjoy OIG after your breach.

We are trying to get a good mix of West Palm and Miami / Dade.  Aventura = no West Palm, Boca = No Miami/Dade. 


It's OK.  It's close enough to my mother's house to where I visit often, but it's too damn big, and it's expanding!  Service usually sucks there, unless you have a reserved table.  I go to @MackHouseDavie, recently awarded best cheap craft beer hangout in South Florida:  http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/best-of/2015/food-and-drink/best-cheap-craft-beer-hangout-7045316
http://twitter.com/BelfastSec is the closest ... but it doesn't mean you can't start one yourself... I'm sure London could use one!

+1 for Primanti Bros... it's a late night necessity if you are on the beach and hungry at any hour.  Recommend a Pittsburger and a slice of pizza = FULL
and over-priced Mai Tai's!
+1 for Butterfly World - cant miss.  If you Segway, try a beach tour.
Buddha does tours... but its so big that service usually sucks.  I like The Mack House (if you are headed West on 595 - http://themackhouse.com ) 
I've never been to Wine Watch, but the craft beer bar in that same plaza (901 Progresso) has The Laser Wolf (hipster beer bar - http://laserwolf.com - ZAGAT rated top 10 bars in FTL)
They don't ... still showing my SB4200 from my OLD HOUSE as inactive on my account... but still showing on my account.  Gave it to a friend on another local / municipal cable provide.

FireEye / Mandiant is still using MD5 hashes.  Hopefully an exploitable theory will cause a patch.  They seemed pretty quick on #VENOM virtualization vuln.  Hopefully will moved software to use SHA256.

Yup...  the original brewer and the current owner started the Mack House, but the brewer (Robert Gordash - http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/restaurants/bobby-gordash-leaves-holy-mackerel-signs-on-with-florida-beer-co-6891517 )sold his stake and moved on to work at Florida Beer Co.

They have a new brewer though, and are trying new and unique brews.  Old school Nintendo's, Netflix on XBOX one, and usually soccer are on the tubes!
Stage 84 got 86'd a couple years ago... there is an awesome craft beer place there now called The Mack House.

MKX + Kombat Pack + Blue Steel Sub-Zero = $92

The only way I'm spending any more cash is for more characters.
I hate assholes on this board who down vote people who are critical of Netherrealm.  
<In best stereotypical type-casted Italian mobster voice>  

"Look at this shiny new retail title you just bought for $60... it would be a shame if something were to happen and sully the pristine nature of this game, like advertisement for content you'll probably never buy..."
I'm guessing we are going to get ass (err, wallet) raped for both Klassic Fatalities... because I don't remember seeing them in the Kombat Pack DLC description.  


My guess (not included in Kombat Pack):

•Skin Pack - Kold War @ $3.99 + 

•Skin Pack - Brazil @ $3.99 + 

•Klassic Fatalities 1 @ $3.99 + 

•Klassic Fatalities 2 (354413) @ $3.99

MKX = $60 + 

Kombat Pack (thought it would get me everything) = $30 + 

Blue Steel Sub Zero (didn't mind paying extra) = $2 

SPENT SO FAR:  $92 


Additional (unexpected) costs = $16

Total DLC cost (expected thus far) = $48 (80% of original game)

Grand TOTAL = $108

I feel bad for the players who didn't at least buy the Kombat Pack, cause they are going to have to look at those FOUR EMPTY SPACES on their character select screen forever.  If they press it, they get moved to the store.  Buy a $60 game, get advertised to for the life of your game, unless you fork over an additional 50% for DLC... seems like racketeering (mob tactics) to me!

They need to make a Mortal Kombat where all characters say smart ass shit all the time!
Probably for the same reason that I don't play Street Fighter.
That's why I would like videos of this... data for the experiment!

While all cable companies suck... Advanced is no where near as bad as Comcrap.
Can't help you there.  Things don't move fast in HR; took me almost 3 months, from application to hire.  But... at least when they do make a decision, either way, you will get a call!  (silver lining).
Come on, #Reddit...

I appreciate the attempt.
From what I understand they are designing a secondary interface for sub-8 inch tablets.  Seems to me like a bit of a waste.

Even though your comment has been downvoted to hell, I agree about the craptastic Game of Thrones inspired ending.   I can smell the horrible from here.
No... just that they are getting these calls.  It happens like this sometimes, where a developer will only release in certain areas.

Learn Linux... Backtrack / Kali ... Metasploit (if you wanna do pen testing).  CISSP is the gold standard for security... use that as a primer.
Specialization in IT is Key... shit is moving way too fast to be a generalist. Before it was just M$ and Cisco... and you could just support those two things and be OK.  Now people have wised to Linux (cost), and mobile platforms are taking over (and constantly changing).

A jack of all trade is good if you are with a company a long time and respects your expertise/ experience. I was a generalist who moved to Security, and that move is paying in dividends.  

Get your shut together ASAP, though... time is running out.

I loved the fact that the creator of said app is from Doral. #SouthFlorida people will understand why that's funny.

#I will SUCK YO DICK for some spoilers!
Same here ... I never played MK:Special Forces, but have pretty much done everything else.  Started playing MK1 in the 7-11 next to my bus stop, Freshman year in high school - MK3 in Senior Year.  I became a fanboy when MK: Trilogy was one of the few titles available for the N64 Freshman year in college.  Became OCD when MK4 and MK:Annihilation came out within months of each other.

I could go on for days!

[Sub-Zero has already gone grey in Deadly Alliance.](http://a3.ec-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/149/950a39f9e11f41c2b7cec40284f5224f/l.jpg)

Sub-Zero was an MKX hipster... he went grey before it was considered cool!

This site looks sketchy as fuck.
They had an MK1 machine in the Bay Pines 7-11 after high school (9th  or 10th grade)... getting my ass handed to me by Larry Kent.  Played MK2 a lot at the ice skating rink I hung out at sophmore or junior year in Clearwater.
I'm soooo pissed, spent $10 on the digital download for AC4:BF and still haven't played it #FUCK!
Possibly an announcement for Mortal Kombat X OST (official sound track)
ALL I NEEDED TO READ:
"The majority of suspects brandished a weapon"
A good effort

MK: Special Forces is easily the worst.
MKM: Sub-Zero has a clunky interface, but a good story... MK4 was an experiment into 3D tech, and like MKM: Sub-Zero, split the Midway team in two.
MK: Armageddon had a story that killed the franchise requiring a reboot (a effect of MK: Deadly Alliance & MK: Deception).
MK3 was so meh (after MK2 total domination), it had to have an upgrade to Ultimate to make it tolerable.

If anyone has anything bad to say about MK: Shaolin Monks, we'll have words out back.  
#Thanks

1)  Go into the control panel;  
2)  Disable the Wireless Ethernet adapter;  
3)  Wait 15 seconds;  
4)  Enable the wireless Ethernet adapter.

We had a good showing (about 3 dozen) until someone came and held an American Flag upside down.  Changed the entire vibe of the protest in 15 minutes.  The original protest relocated down the street, many left.
