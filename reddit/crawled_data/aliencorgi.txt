like 95% of it was korean haha
leaky dick
korea? im pretty sure the first ever tornado happened like 3 years ago in korea
the first couple shots made it look as big as a great white and then when it cut to the wide.... that was anti climatic 
that was pretty sik
i would love one!! iphone 8 plus :) my silicone case is wearing off and i was just looking for a new case
im a pretty heavy user and dang 97 is pretty good considering ive had it for like 7 months

yeahh haha thanks for the suggestion tho!
my current 50mm setup is the OLD ef 50mm 1.8 II from canon with 5 blades. The focusing is actually not that bad but I want something faster in terms of AF and better quality
How is rokinon as a brand? af speed and build quality wise?

I have my eyes on the Zeiss 50 1.4 but oh my it‚Äôs expensive.. definitely more of a end game 50 lens
Im looking for a 50mm with nice round bokeh (9 aperture blades?) with good image quality and minimal distortion. anyone recommend one that is hopefully sub $1000?

atm I am resorting to my canon 50mm 1.8 with the metabones adapter but would prefer to stick with sonys mount.

I havent heard the best things about sony‚Äôs nifty fifty so Im looking at all my options :)
i have that same 3 bulb light! sooo nice
so pressure washing should be ok right

i always thought that yuru camp was sponsered by the government or some sort of tourism/outdoor education organization to promote going outdoors and enjoying mt fuji.

its not some crazy conspiracy theory and i can totally see it being a thing. a kdrama i watched a one or two years ago that was pretty popular, Goblin, was sponsored by the Canadian government and Air Canada to promote going to Montreal (which totally worked)
yoo hmu! :)) i would love one
ive been watching the first couple of episodes on crucnhyroll, its great and really fun, but the animation and art style has always seemed like fan art to me, almost.. plastic-y? I guess im just really used to the dbz era art style 

that being said i checked out 130 and some of the newer episodes and they look much better than the first couple
im not sure if this is a unpopular opinion or not


but i wish dbs had that animation style/aesthetic
ok unidan
would love to see hourly forecasts, sunset/rise hours, and weather source switchers!
russianbadger oh my

i miss bf3
Canon's rebel lineup is pretty good with magic lantern, its what I started with and still recommend. I've also heard good things about panasonic's g7, even shoots 4k, but I don't know about their stills qualty. 
you could find one for around $2000 for used. a 50mm 1.8 runs for around $150 
difference is that she doesnt sell them
i wear cropped trousers


and i tuck my sweats sometimes :(
oh ym fking god that makes me so hyped

gotta rewatch gl again
idk but its fairly common among younger churches and with the youth/young adult demographics

a lot of them have like an slp-ish look going on with leather jackets, skinny biker jeans, and chelsea boots. and dont forget the sweep back hair with short sides haha

i dont see it too much in my church since i come from a second gen korean church but i do see it around other churches for sure
holy same here

pls lmk if u find any im dying here
worship leaders still be wearing them
and that tactile feeling you have on real calculators feel soo much better than typing it out on your phone

really good drama, u should check it out! you ahould also check out reply 1988 for them authentic 80s fashion (andif you want to cry every episode)
all the fits in goblin were super dope

which also kind of bothered me because the main character was supposed to be kinda poor but she has more outfits than my family combined
im so happy this is a thing
i have an iphone 8+ now, but use my nexus 6 as a media player

either way one of edgar wrights best skills as a director is making an experience out of a film and baby driver is just that. I still highly recommend you giving it a watch

miyukgook is realllly good even if it looks like it isnt LOL. its very hearty and amazing with rice

i can totally sympathize with you tho. if i wasnt korean a lot of our food would look a little gross to me too
you should try korean fried chicken and some REAL kbbq
yeah a lot of korean food doesnt really translate well into english... ddukbokki is like spicy rice cakes with fish cakes, and miyukgook is like seaweed soup with beef LOL
what is the special called? its one of my favorite instruments

there are a lot of overlap and its a pretty vague category, but think kirk franklin for gospel, and hillsong for contemporary christian. Contemporary christian usually is more "modern" in that it has rock or pop elements whereas gospel is more vocal/choir centered and soul gospel rooted
theyre the new old skools i guess, i was talking to the sales ppl there and they said they usually sont hold a lot of stock since its winter but they sold out like crazy

great sense of nostalgia rn

do you have a link to this press release?
where does she live? she'll probably have better luck finding it online than in korea
this sub does the opposite of worshipping virgil though...
why would you go to seoul and buy ripndip LOL 

also seoul is a *huge* city, you might find it in like in myeongdong or hongdae since theyre more touristy places and might have more import clothes. i wouldn't hold my breath on it tho, it's probably not big there at all. If you want that kind of aesthetic, go to small stores in hongdae or dongdaemeun and browse around the more edgy or skater stores

idk if this is my case or what but my black iphone 8plus silicon case has been wearing out in less than two weeks.

The front rim has had its soft rubber worn down, and the corners of the phone have also worn down from going in and out of my pocket. It‚Äôs only had regular use and constant cleaning so idk of its just my case or if it‚Äôs that fragile..
i miss this roster :(
not on its own ud need something over it

or wear some thermal underneath but dont expect to wear in -20 degrees imo
a what?
hmm i see

i decided that i was going to do a clean install and reorganize stuff anyways so i guess it works out

what conditions can you replace earpods?
that coat is beautiful
it was an exaggeration on my end, but for instance, going back to the cpu throttling, you would have needed to change the kernal or something to prevent that.

furthermore, even if this isnt rooting, if you wanted the fastest software updates from google it would be faster sideloading it via adb. That whole process is a pain the ass for people who arent familiar with that area. Otherwise to get software updates over the air, (for me at least) you would have to wait up to an additional week or two which to me is kind of ridiculous. 
i was a diehard android person just a couple of monthes ago, but im so tired of rooting, digging through settings, just to make things WORK. iphones just *work* for me I dont really know how to explain it.

Also i‚Äôm coming from a nexus 6 (2014) and that phone was great at first but became pretty unusable after two years. Major screen burn in because of the crappy oled panel, the nexus logo was peeling off, back looked disgusting because of the scratches and weird plastic deformities, the built in daq was pretty meh, and the biggest issue was battery life and cpu throttling below 50% which was mind blowing LOL it cut down to 2 cores below that threshold.

i wanted a phone that worked well effortlessly, lasted the whole day without a problem, would last me for the years to come, and had a great camera, so as soon as my contract ended I bought the iphone 8 plus
its literally going to come out as lava

definitely his verge work. that was the verge‚Äôs golden age tbh, i miss josh
or dont wear ripped jeans in the cold
hey i love this song
black ones sold out :(
anyone have any beanie recommendations?? looking to wear it like a fisherman's beanie ([like this](https://i.imgur.com/ENYSLXO.png))
i love this so much dude
no longer the case for these ones

source: i have one and it fits tts compared to other tees in the same size
thats pretty awesome
furthermore no one here is actually making fun of him, were all supporting the dude
nahh towards ur face looking dark with white shirts? 
oh wait i meant to reply to the white shirt comment not this LOL but thanks for the explanation anyways! 
i've never heard that sentiment before, what do you mean by that?

and love the button up, where from?
this guys like a character straight out of atlanta or something
>"Realistic"
yeah, it was like 15ish degrees highest so it was way to warm to wear anything else underneath than a tshirt
wait


guys i messed up
maybe ill post it next time i wear it :) didnt take any pics cus the weather was so crappy :(
that sounds amazing i hope thats true! I don't mind using it until it starts showing some real wear but if they agree to replace it for free then it truly earns that $50 price tag haha
do ssense sales start ON black friday? some stores do their sales prior to the actual day and I don't want to miss out!
tkl master race
wore one today

-black oversized camel/over coat

-asap/guess shirt

-cropped white pants

-all white sneakers

my church fit
one thing i noticed though is after using it for a couple of days the front rim begins to wear out pretty quickly :( i just bring mine to school and it stays in my pocket/top of my desk. another thing is that it picks up dust more than other cases i use, particularly on the front, so i have to clean it often

other than that i really am loving this case :) not totally sure if its worth the $50 but that microfibre lining definitely makes up for the minor inconveniences it comes with
yup! if i wanted great manual controls i would use a different app, but for the stock camera app i want to be able to take a great photo as soon as possible. 
weathers been so crazy these past couple of days :( Like friday was warm, saturday was freezing and windy and today is rainy and cold and humid ugh
the flesh was fake im guessing cus thats nastyy

literally what i thought of when i saw the name rainbow rocket and all the other bosses teaming up together
i know herschel often gets a bad rap about being ‚Äúbasic‚Äù but i cannot recommend the settlement backpack more. I have one in caramel and its sooo nice. im super pissed cus i accidentally hit my pen on my bag and now have two streaks of black ink on the top of my bag

anyways yeah herschel is dope
not where i expected a twice reference
just how tshirts should be :)
AND THE QUALITY ITS SO COMFY
fr, kpop stans are on a different level ;;
they ARE ur beaters now :)
yeah i felt them in store l, they look nice but theyre hella thin :( moves around too much when u walk
yes
how did it drop? im assuming screen up right?
the fufu bogos are mostly for tourists haha

but yah hongdae and myeongdong has some nice small stores :)

if you look around some department stores (like hyundai department stores) they also tend to have some nice pieces
i heard that mcdonalds bought their previous coffee supplier or something of that sort, mcdonalds coffee tastes much better than timmies imo
what? that might have not even happened at all LOL my hair tie leaves an imprint in my arm but it moves around a lot so you could see where it was last.
they have gh5s which is arguably better than the mkIV which i THINK sp7 has

either way the gh5 is one of the best mirrorless cameras on the market rn :)
ran into her in a mcd‚Äôs earlier this week (she goes to a close highschool to our school) didnt recognize her until my friend mentioned that she was the girl from [NAME OF HIGHSCHOOL] thats instafamous

best reddit app on ios! Ive been hurting for a good ios app since my transition to an iphone but all of them had its major design differences i couldnt get used to. Thanks for the hard work!!

also, is there any way you could add the option to handle links differently? for example, instead to using the built in player for youtube, opening straight to the youtube app?
I went from grunge to full on jerryboi back to a lower key grunge to skater to cozy skater

 now im in grey area between skater and japanese baggywear thing? still super inspired by skater brands and people like tyler though
I either got suuuper lucky or these arent as hyped as i thought. was walking around a large mall in toronto (yorkdale) a couple days ago and 3 racks of the tees and a couple of denim jackets were sitting out right in front of the door. ended up copping the blue/yellow striped tee and couldnt be happier
id say the phone industry has bigger things to worry about honestly... like exploding batteries and better screens im general LOL
unless they can make a glass thats durable enough that wont be for a very long time :(
same setup as you! yeah i agree the constant dust and lint specks building up in the case makes me want to clean it every day... planning to pick up apples silicon case to at least protect the glass back so sand or other materials wont scratch it up
ikr as soon as i saw the dsm logo i was pretty taken aback LOL
this is dope love the striped tee

also ay toronto boiz
they dont i believe :(
ass to ass
yup its happening on my iphone 8+ space gray
shined it right under a lamp and examined for a bit, maybe ill pull out a magnifying glass but i think at that point ill be LOOKING for imperfections that at that scale are most likely inevitable
i guess im really lucky then... black  64gb no dust specks at all
was on nexus 6 and switched to 8+ 64

i couldn't be happier. There are some inconveniences I have to get used to tho, like notifications. I think android handles notifications SO well and it's a little weird to get used to iOS' take on it. Another thing is the headphone jack i guess but I'm not that bothered by it. Battery life is SO amazing especially compared to my nexus, so is the performance.
both made by the same company - could be either way but judging from the camera cutouts its probably more likely the actual case
how much does the shoulder drop?
what is on that rig? It's a dji osmos right?
hey man i love ur tees how heavy/thick are they? if anything this situation is giving u some publicity :) don't let them win fam
ive had my since september 2015, runs ok now that i dont have any apps on it other than some media apps like netflix. I only use it as a media device now that I switched to ~~an iphone~~ a different phone. battery still drains like crazy when used )(stand by is respectable still), still lags under 50% though.

love the bag :) really want a shoulder bag but they seem hard to find for a reasonable price
Living in toronto rn and it's 31 degrees please kill me I want to wear pants


in the winter it gets pretty cold depending on the year though. It can get downwards to -30C in some extreme cases so bundle up boi, you'll need a winter jacket either way. If you're strapping for cash uniqlo has amazing down jackets for a reasonable price :)

btw are you going to Queens?


Idk if this is because im new to i0s 11 (coming from android) but i feel like there are a lot of bugs im encountering

Will be doing my first pre-order, will I be able to preorder through Rogers?
its a great start! i know its supposed to be super minimal but would suggest adding some more distinguishing features like an eye/whiskers/nose/etc. also the shape of cat could also maybe be a little wider/rounder

i discovered him when that youtube competition thing was going on (like 2011 or something?), and then a couple months ago i stumbled upon his channel and the first video i saw was a fidget spinner video LOL i didnt kmow what to think
they probably docked points on color/contrast and uniqueness for the nike logo

the meme however... uhhh
I literally just refinished community for the fourth time and I totally agree. It really felt like community at times for sure. Especially the pep talks Arin or Dan gives to the team and how Jeff in Community does to the group. I actually quite liked this, much more than I expected
i love worldbuilding like this. halo and SW are my favorite sci-fi universes.
there are some websites that you can design the cutouts and they cut them out for you. its super overkill though LOL

and if you do get foam inserts without cutouts u can always get an xacto knife and do them yourself
buy a pelican suit case with exact cuttouts for shoes :)
impact has good hair imo. pretty popular in korea, his blonde hair he had in TIP was dope too
how is the sizing? :) love the colors
mcdonalds vibe
how do their tshirts fit? want oversized luk
das all fear of god stuff
i just want them cooking specials ;(
i got all white leather stan smiths, theyre really nice and I prefer them to the og green colorway, much cleaner/quieter looking sneaker. The only problem with them is that they crease easier than any other stan smiths that I know of. I think they use a different type of leather or something, its much easier to scuff/crease for some reason. But honestly I actually prefer them to be a little beat up anyways so I'm not mad.

I'm also looking to buy a pair of af1s, I think they're super clean and nice looking - bot new and beat up. Yeah sure they're basic (as is the SS) but its not what you get, but how you pull them off in fits. Besides af1s and stans are staples, you can never truly play them out. :)

You should also consider reeboks clubs and classics. Both very clean and nice silhouette. Old skools all white canvas are pretty noice too
i love those guys but i miss their older content
we need to go deeper
i grew UP with chocopies theyre the besttt
and imagine the price of that in canada holy moly
ill trade u my n6 for that iphone
im so firRIKIN excited
she has more confidence that all of yall combined
and i really like that about them honestly, theyre becoming one of my favorite brands. love how they rep new york
only sold as excel in canada :) i was confused too
theyre still pissed about famous LOL
have to watch your macros obv
:) i like that
favorite food in korea? enjoy it there man :) (korea can be a bitch in summer tho as you probably know by now)

I was super excited to hear you randomly on broadcast, had idea no idea you were going to cast LCK. super cool to see you exceed in this industry. Keep it up and hope to see you succeed!
that fender oh my godDD
yeah prices r rape and its not worth it imo. i like some pieces but its pretty much hypebeast trap
GOOD point
did u cop anything from the supreme x louis?
This is the everest signature pack right? looks good :)

[doesnt really sound like dong in english context though?](https://translate.google.com/#auto/ko/%EB%8F%99)
the trick is not telling them my korean name in the first place ;)
my korean name has dong in it and thats why i always hate using it in a non-korean context cus for koreans, dong (Îèô) is pronounced more like "d-OH-ng" but the romanization sounds more like dong
thats a very specific category of sneakers

algonquin park is such an amazing place. Went canoe tripping there for five days and every view was picture worthy.

portaging is a bitch tho
Looks great! the soundtrack fits really well and adds to the atmosphere, but one thing i would say is to cut down on the rack focus shots, one or two is fine but you have a couple too many :) other than that its well done

Hmm maybe the hanes t-shirts will last longer if you hang dry it? I've had a gildan thrasher tee for over a year now, and its done pretty well, only small cracks in the graphic, and a little bit of discoloration, no pilling or anything. I'm hoping hanes beefy tees will do the same as well.
whats your wash cycle for tshirts? hang dry?
cus he a cutie
why all them so salty tho


who hurt them doc
second dean post here LOL deans got some nice frames man..
how do american appearal fit? similar to hanes beefy/ gildan 5000?

do you have a sizing chart on your tees? really digging the yellow tee

also how long is estimated shipping to TO, Canada?
just got all white stans and i love them

air force 1, SS, and old skools are all great choices for everyday fits

converse with the padding are really comfy too
BRO SAME

it was my first shirt i bought that was over $100(CAD) LOL
yo that metallica boxy shirt is actually one of my favorite shirts

its so damn comfy
love the tshirt and pullovers

btw how thick is this striped tshirt? on like a scale of 1/10
i know how you feel

it just feels.. awkward? i dunno. but im sure itll get better over time
Have you tried halo online?
damn if i hadnt just gotten a new pair of shoes i would have made a bee-line for these :(

If your friend bought them for you, you should keep them :) they seem like pretty good portable headphones. 
those pants look amzing
do gildan and hanes fit similarly?

like does a gildan xl fit like a hanes xl?
uniqlo has oversized tshirts! they're a little more expensive than regular tees but they have a very nice fit and quality to them.

yeah, just go to a local h&m and try them on

those pants are everythingggg
which muji pants are those?
pinroll is no bueno here imo! either cuff them or let them sit with ur shoes (roshes are also no bueno here)
damn those are skinnies??
ÏïàÎÖï Ìòï!! ÎØ∏Íµ≠ Í∞ÄÎãàÍπå Ïñ¥ÎïåÏöî?? Ïñ¥ÎîîÍ∞Ä Îçî Î≥¥Í≥† Ïã∂Ïñ¥Ïöî? Î∏åÎùºÏßà ÏïÑÎãàÎ©¥ ÌïúÍµ≠?
i wish they made a 4.7" 5s
i go to winners and get these tommy socks, super comfy and super long, so they dont show skin
i would recommend never going up to f/1.8 unless its really that dark. you can get good bokeh and blurred backgrounds even with like f/2-3.2. its all about composition. having your aperture set to 1.8 can make your subject out of focus. keep in mind:

bigger the aperture = more light and shallower DOP = harder to get subject in focus


smaller the aperture = less light and sharper DOP = more things in focus


This can be explained if you wear glasses or something. take off your glasses and make a small hole with your hand, then look through it. you can see that everything will be in focus! this is also how pinhole cameras work.

watch some videos on youtube to help you with these kinds of things :) photography can be super fun, but there simple basic fundamentals you should learn to will help you take even better photos.
i think a cuff would be ok here, but yeah pinroll looks out of place here tho
who hurt u
looks good!! tbh im lowkey thinking of shaving my legs LOL my asian leg hair is so damn weird and patchy
what nmd color way?
do they stretch at all?
how are they around ur crotch? i heard theyre a bit uncomfortable
aw :) i like dis

happy resurrection sunday!
toast
i dont know what else they would look like tbh LOL like maybe trousers but not a lot of trousers have a different color interior
honestly they just look like slim-skinny black jeans thats rolled up.

search for black denim
7 comments but none about the shirt haha

where did you find the photo? could be like a thrift find from the looks of it. looks hella dope tho
try everlane, they just released some new shorts for this season
theyre not testing sadly.. its here to stay :(
used to live in ulsan as well! i actually laughed when i saw this lol

to be fair tho its not really our *flag* more like our banner and slogan. [this is closer i think](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/18/Symbol_of_Ulsan.svg)
man these are AWESOME! love the messages next to them too
this is TOO MUCH FOR ME
Hi bby
hope he didnt get any ketchup on that shirt :(
idk it just doesnt work for me LOL i think maybe theyre too "smart"? I think its the colour, honestly
not feeling those pants. cropped black trousers without the front crease might have done better here

also this photo does *not* do justice to this fit LOOL
i was gonna get these for a photoshoot, but personally wouldnt wear these in public haha
WORD!! korean fanbases are bruuttall... i mean did u hear how ÍπÄÍ≥†ÏùÄ from ÎèÑÍπ®ÎπÑ was bombarded with hate messages cus she didnt wear makeup in an ig post? ffs LOL
Not totally related, but holy crap, as someone who was born in korea, and have a alot of first gen family, that whole Tiffany scandal was the stupidest shit ever. It might have been insensitive because it happened on the same day as Korea's independence day, but it was for one, on her *snapchat*, and she was just using a japanese geofilter letting people know she's in Japan for a show LOL (albeit the geofilter was the rising sun, which snapchat removed afterwards). People took that WAY too far and overreacted over something completely unintentional smh netizens
oh..
np man! always good vibes :)

and ic!! do u have a link?
hair is wavy, i like it (could never pull it off myself :( )

also where did u get your glasses?
u rdy for -12 tmr? ;)
damn my thin asian hair
do you need thicker hair to achieve this look?
i can see how people find it tacky or whatever.. but hell is it comfortable on lazy days woo
hows the quality and sizing?
oh my god i want to hug him
if it isnt a dessert, what is it?
ah~
those are nice, i love my pair :)

i think round frames would like nice in you too. also where did you get that teeee
BANGER ALERT BANGER ALERT
white socks might have been better (if you didnt want black socks), im not *completely* sold on the matchy socks. sick fit and photo though!! love the jacket
just like TT
peep that pocari sweat candy
yeah, esp for the quality.. idk if its just my pair but the outer sole is sort of peeling off :/ kinda upset about that
üá∞üá∑üá∏üá¨üá∞üá∑üá∏üá¨üá∞üá∑üá∏üá¨

@avanope on ig

hmm... this might be worth the $80cad ü§î
is it printed on gildan?
ahh i figured
where is the tshirt from?
kinda random question, but are the red tags on your old skools in tact? mine are ripping off slowly :(
WUCK FESTERN
yup, those shoes are not meant for slipping on and off :(
do you tumble with dryer sheets after hang drying?
do you untire your shoes when you put them on/take them off?
LMAO he's not that bad! lhe can type fine iirc and he can speak at like a 5th grade level so for a second-gen korean american he's ok
word im more of an old spice fiji dude
of course.. how could I be so blind!
i need money
i miss cody :( he gifted me a ward skin once for drawing his legs
when you eat healthier your skin gets cleared up too
good dick can do that
or you live in an area with dry winter air
i personally cuff them an inch or two above the shoe

that being said i like how the jeans stack on this specific photo, usually it looks kinda meh
josh fu!!! totally didnt expect him to be in here haha

thought the cinematography and lighting was super great. loved the tone in this. as for audio i have to agree with everyone here, it felt really empty and at times inconsistent. The room cleaning scene was a tiny bit confusing, i couldn't tell if the father was dead or not until the last scene. Overall it was an entertaining and touching short film! great job man
hang on wooden hangers, just make sure when your putting and taking off the garmet, its thru the bottom hole, instead of the neck hole. prolonged folding can potentially crack the graphic
lol what isnt a meme üôÑ
retro brands are coming back. theyre also cheap, accessible, and for a blank theyre very good quality.
i was so sad i wasn't able to get any of the dva skins or the korean icon so im praying that i get this one

i think thats the point of it, super vintage esque. the back is sort of ugly though
yeah if you have the funds you can never go back to those cheap ass gildan blanks
oo i see, the longer hand cuffs, side details, slightly fatter waistband all sorta made them look similar
wait a sec is this a champion blank
can you get a xl levis jacket and get the same look?

UO just has those exclusive colors and the chest patch

so i mean if you get a chest patch from etsy, or from a cheaper champion tee or whatever by all means
yeah op just skip leg day for a bit
lmao look up champion s700 on amazon my friendd
kiinda regret getting clubmasters tbh

you can get more basic colors on amazon for like $30, theyre the same material and quality, UO just has these exclusive colorways and the front patch to my belief.

how is the waistband compared to gildan? also how is the size compared to gildan? looks doope
u alreaayy knooo PTL
would superglue be enough LOL
did you use the customizer?
ur gildan flair says otherwise ü§î

/s


by the way, is the sizing similar to gildan hoodies? so gildan L is similar to champion L?
theyre like over $100 in canada :(
those screens just break so easily:(

dang i really really like these.. how rare are these and how much did they go for?
ohhh TIL! thanks:)
which is the most accurate?
id love to see these in a different colorway
it was sold out by the time the coupons were handed out so people who expected tees got screwed over pf any chance
whats wrong with *YOUR* lips?
wth that coat looks jazzzy i love it. It fits in your aesthetic rock it man. 
i usedthe wrong pen and it smudged out right quick :( looks real ugly now
w2c?

hit up thrifts, look around some [bigcartels](https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/529ob8/favorite_startup_brandsonline_stores/), go to your local street markets. You just gotta look around.
site sells fakes :(
dang i didn tthink marlham would be mentioned in somewhere like this

but fr real estate is nuts here
i cant wait for their comeback üòç
theyre just knee socks bunched up

try uniqlo
a lot of people say theyre "played out" because they see a lot of people wearing them in the sub, but ive only maybe ever seen one or two people wearing them in real life, and i live in toronto. I personally love these shoes and wouldnt stop wearing them just because some guy on reddit said theyre "played out". Besides, theyre a pair of converse, you can't really play out converse
hows the build quality on the stabilizer? Didn't hear the best things for Neewer
literally woke up to a notification telling me its ready and i thought i was actually still sleeping
those pastel sk8 his look cool but thats about it tbh
possibly nav buttons? unless theyre strictly for pixel phones which dont REALLY make sense
my 3/4 boxy sweater and my cdg cons get a lot of love
yeah thats true, maybe im being a little harsh on the city, but im still super hyped about ns and uniqlo
eugene park looking beautiful as ever
ohh that would make more sense

but yeah dont match feetsies with topsies
toronto is FINALLY getting some nicer stores. Uniqlo opening was also a HUGE success, couldn't go myself, but the lines were crazy
if i cover the yeezys with my hand, its a good fit, but if you wanted to incorporate them, I'd say keep the top neutral and dark, like a black sweater. This way it keeps the attention on the shoes and not elsewhere.
what is that bento box? it looks so compact!
yeah for sure, i wasnt expecting such nice quality on the tees,
not the BEST things in the world but its better than the gildan hoodies most people have id say

no crazy waistband

nice colors

(assuming) nicer quality cotton
lookin like a superhero in a disguise fam
ohh, that makes things easier! thanks
hey how does the shirt fit? i was thinking about buying it awhile ago, but was unsure about sizing
ayy is that the hm camo shirt

my collar on that stretched like a mofo after a couple washes, inly wear it at home now :(
hmm that makes sense! I gonna try to hit up the one opening up downtown toronto soon, actually so happy its finally here
if you have instructions on how to use it, you know youre doing something wrong
yeah, i dont know if sizes vary in different countries, but when i was in korea, i tried on a large and my broad ass shoulders made them looks like kids wear LOL
i hope hes safe :(
dude why do clothes look so weird on asos models

is this just me, cus like any "boxy" tee on asos models look like straight up muscle tees 
transparency hoodie would be amazing, thank you for the giveaway!
his actual reddit user is u/realmarkhamill
are those sleeves raglan?
its his 'brand' or name it looks like, to show that its his pictures and not grabbed from google images. kinda creative way of doing it
nah sorry :( im a tts large 
gonna call some h&ms around me soon, hope canada gets a bunch too 
excited for my metallica tee to come in
aw i really liked his work on the verge, sad to see things ended this way :(
hm.. alright! thanks :)
how can you tell?
side details on that are nice, totally perfect for layering
i like how much effort u put into the outline :) no way i could have the patience to do this on paint
H&M, PacSun, Elwood, UO, Zara, ASOS all should have them
can we have fitpics? i wanna see how it fits
OMG JJANGUU that was my jam as a kid
would have been sick if they were actual bibles

a pastor i know definitely would have rocked this to church every sunday
tote bags and shoulder fanny packs (if thats what they're called) are super popular in korea too. I carry one around in toronto, you just gotta b confident about it.
yeah its pretty sick lighting at a concert lol. im just imaging how awesome it would have been for the people there in person, id say pretty chill-worthy
i do appreciate their work, i like their music and stuff. the only reason i was reconsidering getting the Metallica tee was because i felt that band tees were getting played out, and id like to have something last.

my final decision is to (eventually) get them both, im going to get the metallica tee first, and then a couple months later ill get the striped tee. its sort of expensive to buy both at the same time because im getting it from grailed, and shipping to canada is no joke LOL
holy crap i got chills looking at that damn

ye knows how to put on a show
sunday costco is literally the worst :(
ahhh i miss home :(
lol nahh i live in toronto :(
fk i gave up right at 5:30, nothing was working,couldnt check out :/
chelseas, i like the versatility of them over the quasas 
how does everyone have coke jackets


did they give them to parents in the 80-90s and whisper in their ear "give this to your son one day itll b lit faam"
yeah wtf man its so brainless

like how does supreme do it so well
man pacsun absolutely dropped the goddamn ball on this drop lol i dont think i'll ever buy something from them again im so salty.

whats the point of having a line if youre not going to use it 30 minutes later and then kill the whole website 
looks sweet! :)
Hi
ahh ok! thanks:)
yeah :( only got "confirmation" of S-L
yup lol the bandanna is $14 and shipping is $12 (for canada) lol
lol if my mom saw a travis scott condom in the mail she'll literally cut my penis off
imma try to put mine up on grailed see what i can salvage LOL so disappointed :/ you have to pay for shipping and that and a $10 album i didn't end up listening to that much is not worth
man i got a bandanna

better then a condom but
it like whenever i wear white we always go out to eat something messy af

its unfair :'(
yeah fr

i came in the first day and saw at least 6 other people wearing flame tees. not that thrasher is anything special to begin with, but it made me want to wear it significantly less ngl

made me kinda mad cus it fit really well and its such a comfort/lazy day tee
you don't go to timmies expecting amazing food lol. thats like going to mcdonalds and expecting some five star gourmet burgers

sometimes you need something cheap and processed :)
right now one of my favorite and most worn outfits are


-Black white logo thrasher tee


-h&m black sweatshorts


-cdg cons high

just really simple in terms of complexity, great for the weather we've been having, and for school
honestly one the best art thats come out of this sub, keep it going man 
sweet list :) been looking for something like this
you dont go to op's grandma's house?
what model levis did you get?
I LOVE YOUR DOG
Tron
got the album and hoping i got the free giveaway but hella disappointed with the merch :(

^(maybe theres a reason theyre giving it away ^^dont ^^hurt ^^me)
i think he means a small inspo album
its super hot in nyc rn and these models are wearing full on winter jackets :/

maybe next time they should run the show inside
really like those caps, keep it up! :)
i saw it a couple days ago, and until then i never heard of this movie - no trailers no nothing (i even thought the main character was a girl until my friend told me). i went in with almost no expectations and came out speechless on how great it was, easily one of my favorite movies so far this year. 
red maple and high tech :)
toronto, ON
i was at an h&m and one dude came up to me and asked where i got my sweater tee from, it sucked when i told him i got it from korea :(
shoot sorry i left but if i stop by again and these are still there i would love to :)
Red Maple and High Tech
yeah im super hyped for that!

except we have to wait two years :(
their newer tees are cut and sew, don't know too much about their older ones tho
[here u go](http://www.stromoctober.com/)
ur hair is so nice omg
theyd probably make good running shoes!
fkk i want a nordstrom rack so badly in toronto :(

theres an actual nordstrom coming downtown next month but the rack is coming 2018 ughh
dont take a doo doo when your shirt is drying or itll smell ;)
keep it simple, make the sweater your staple piece. That means less loud of a tee, and maybe some black jeans. Even some lighter jeans would work well. Vans is fine here imo, though :)
do you ship internationally? (Canada) :)
shipping from where?
i miss being able to order it straight to your house


i miss korea ;(
its from h&m
im on the opposite end of the spectrum, need to lose my love handles :(
i like to imagine this guy always has that side of the jacket open to casually let everyone know hes flexin LOL

^but ^for ^real ^i ^like ^this
i could see these looking good in some gothic techwear fits, but the whole sock fit on the ankle on the uncaged boosts look so odd to me. i wish they kept the tongue from the caged boosts
i knew i recognized the model
may take long to do it by hand tbh!
got so many pieces i liked from uni when i was in korea, so glad its finally coming to canada
hey now

sudden isnt SO bad ;\^)
man i love the content this channels been putting out
yeah, from the website layout i could tell they were related to zara LOL

yup theyre all over korea! they sell them in places like festivals, tourist hotspots, and markets, really tasty stuff
if you dont [live in the countries](http://i.imgur.com/pPAxxlp.png) with a shopping bag icon, you can't order it :( . they're based in europe, i've actually never heard of this brand until recently
http://www.bershka.com/kr/man/new-collection/jackets/kimono-c1010046173p100536514.html?colorId=505 here u goo
https://imgur.com/a/hqQFZ one of my favorites, not super hypebeasty, but its still really nice :)
creme or white
i can get teavana for free/discounted so im not complaining
yeah i used to use a rack in korea too, clothes dried in like 2 hours and it was sweet (but if you left it out for too long it started to smell) LOL but im back in canada and just hang dry in my room
wait how do you hang dry without a hanger

do you use a[ rack](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplusautomation/vendorimages/dd870738-ef3e-49d9-ad57-6a6befdb32c1.jpg._CB329120743_.jpg)?
frigg i want a coogi sweater so bad
same here in toronto lol its timbs and canada goose
not op but from this photo i'd say you treat it like an overcoat, and make it the flex piece - dont overdo it elsewhere.
there was actually b99 on a flight i took recently, i was so excited
only reddit would turn a cute gif of a dog reacting to its reflection to whether god exists or not
oversized basics that i can buy locally... maybe im not looking hard enough lol
how thick is the 'crust' can we see pictures? im interested..
i audibly "aww'd" :')
tracer pants
timberlands are a classic
york region bois
oh my god i actually have that hat but in blue
korean genes

im on the other end of korean genes tho, im the only one in my family with hair on my legs :(
i think theyre finally realizing these sell well
ohh thats awesome! must have been a hell of a work out! and here i thought you were playing tekken lol
what game? also what was your figure like, if you dont mind me asking
how can you tell? not saying youre wrong, just wondering
[uniqlo](https://m.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-ma-1-bomber-jacket-178772.html?color=57) bombers are great!
theyre a really neat silhouette but how are they wearing that in rio it looks warm af
i bet it does hurt your seoul :(
bad granny
Personally i wouldnt really use a fit battle app. Rather than an app, a well designed website focused on fit battles that also works well on mobile would be a better choice.

As for wdywt, i think stickied reddit posts are fine for discussion, feedback, etc.
cant wait man :)
i would love the black wavelength tee shirt!

also do you have new sizing measurements for the new cut&sew tees?
i mean they have two silver and two bronze medals, if thats not *something* i dont know what is
hell i mght go to seaworld just to cop this and ive never been to seaworld

^no ^homo
thank you! this is the closest i can find, but it looks like it requires quite a bit of practice and skill.

thanks again!
we need a sub for them ‚ù§
i think he means like when it becomes worn by more people, it makes it "less exclusive" in a way
maybe bring it to a tailor and replace the brim with a different one off a different hat
they only come in full sizes so if your feet arent too wide a 7 will do

http://nomadshop.net/collections/footwear/products/cdgplay-converse-high-wht these guys downtown have a size 7

since its canada you probably wont get cheaper than $190
holy crap i just realized all the kanto starters are reptiles

if youre looking for cheap stuff check out ÌôçÎç∞ and Î™ÖÎèô, places like that hav a lot of small shops that hold some quality clothes for the low (these are places to look out for fakes and reps, so just watch out for that)

hit up Shinsaegae in busan, its the largest shopping complex in the world, also has a cdg mini store!

make sure your hangers are thick enough so it doesnt leave hanger marks on the shoulder. wooden hangers from ikea are the best, they even have separate, wider attachments for the hanger to prevent further creasing

How would you go about achieving this look? I have fairly thin and light hair
sorry for the bad picture, i can't find any more pictures of it, but it looks like some sort of undercut with a 3:7 part, with long hair. How would you achieve this look?
