Honda has had 12 extra months of development , what they do this year is not indicative of last year.  Last year Honda was abysmal . Multiple Japanese articles available in which Honda themselves say that they made major mistakes and missed deadlines and were 7_8 months late on some upgrades 
I will quote Fernando Alonso here : Please,no.
>  Alonso couldn't beat Lewis with equal machinery.

9-6 in Alonso's favor.
>You could add turning down Red Bull as a poor decision. Could have gone there after McLaren for 2008 and when he didn't, they promoted Seb. Reportedly was offered a seat there a few times in the V8 era.

He signed Ferrari contract late 2008. At that time RedBull was a midfield team with no history. Ferrari had won 2007-2008 championships. In the hindsight it's a bad move but at that time, it was the best thing he could do with the information he had.
Hindsight is 2020. None of his decisions apart from McLaren Honda were a gamble.  Renault McLaren and Ferrari all were good moves.
They do. Atleast three other teams are use McLaren's nose pillar design. Ferrari even tested a front wing similar in concept to their front wing. There is always some level of "copying" going on as all teams try hundreds of different stuff before putting one on the car.
> Alonso was a whopping 1.7s slower in qualifying than the Red Bulls and slower than both Renaults

Alonso lost 0.5-0.6 seconds in the sector 1 of his Q2 lap, locked up and flat spotted the tire and then backed off so he doesnt have to start the  race with a flatspotted tire. Without that,he would have been P7-P8 and the gap would have been much smaller. 
>Red Bull are arguably the best team at developing the car through a season so I doubt it really that they’ll be close to them.

That's because in last years RedBull has started with cars that are underdeveloped so that low lying fruit helps them a lot. 
i also remembered spa 2016 and malaysia 2016. They were pretty good in second half of 2016. The car was more or less best of the rest.

And then again they picked up in last 1/2 half of 2017!
> When was the last time McLaren was that high? I remember they were frequently last in 2017

often. Hungary 2017, Hungary 2015,Hungary 2016, I think Austin 2016 and 2015 as well.
lol. enough with the ESPN bullshit.
McLaren 2.5 seconds faster. STR 0.5s slower. That settles it.
Let's go guys!! :D
For fuck's sake.  
Nopes. No way to .stream a race for someone who doesnt know how to use the search option. This is a billionth post asking this in last few days. For fuck's sake.
tbh posting such links here will almost certainly cause such sites to be taken down. PM is where it's at.
> and Haas outsourced the aero to Dallara.

That's factually wrong. Dallara just builds the chassis. It's like Apple and  FoxConn.  Apple designs it, but the manufacturing contract is given to FoxConn.
They didnt say anything. The article is clickbait. Read it, no quote whatsoever from anyone in McLaren saying they will be on redbull level.
Clickbait. No where does anyone from McLaren in that article says we will be around redbull level.
>  but her face is quite mediocre!

Not really, it just that she looks better on video and real life than in photos as in she is not very photogenic.  She looks insanely good in Jumanji.
why do some idiots have to bring up McLaren in everything remotely related to Honda. Lol there is just so much butthurt.
>Ideal scenario:

>Verstappen overtakes Vettel

>Magnussen overtakes Verstappen and Vettel

>Grosjean overtakes Magnussen, Verstappen and Vettel

WHAT A MENTAL GUY.
> Right now the battle for "best of the rest" seems really close with Macca, Haas, and Renault. But McLaren should be way ahead imo considering the constant bragging from them and Alonso that they think they are the quickest in the corners. 

You really dont see that they are on pace of the works teams despite having so much less experience with the Renault PU? 

Are you really forgetting that they finalized their PU change in mid september and the car they are running right is basically the last year's car with newer suspension,floor and the drive train?
why dont you spell it out for us .
> They hide stuff and make it difficult to downgrade or cancel.

Buy a $1 H2O sim and port it out. Done.
I just posted the best sector times, you can look at my comment in the thread.
Had the pace to be in Q3 easily.

Best sector times :

Nando 27.489 22.647 33.206

sainz   27.641 22.695 33.241

hulk    27.544 22.653 33.335

gro     27.546 22.684 33.109

mag    27.490 22.632 33.065

--------------------------------
Not bad considering the other 4 drivers put in their laps on a much more rubbered track. Regardless, Haas seems really good in sector 3. Probably better ERS deployment from Ferrari engine? Remember Ferrari engine is also alteast 2-3ths better than Renault's.

Also I am honestly impressed that McLaren is on works team's pace and more or less 4th fastest despite clearly having a compromised chassis.  The car is essentially a MCL32B right now with Renault engine put in it.   I can see why Nando is so optimistic. I also expect them to get much better once they understand the integration better. Being on Renault's pace after the preseason testing they had is very encouraging.
>Well, maybe it's not better than Renault yet, but McLaren is in the pretty same place they were at the end of last season, so it doesn't look like the best deal in the world.

McLaren had the pace to be in Q3 and were more or less as fast as Renault, Alonso botched his Q2 lap badly. Locked up his tires in S1 and then backed out.

Best Sector times:

sainz 	27.641	22.695	33.241

hulk	       27.544	22.653	33.335

gro		27.546	22.684	33.109

mag	       27.490	22.632	33.065

alo		27.489	22.647	33.206

He lost 6/10ths in his Q2 lap in the sector 1. Made a mistake and had traffic.  Had the pace to be in Q3 easily.  Did a >28 second S1, his best was 27.4xx. Could have been atleast 6/10ths faster than his Q1 lap if not more.
They both got to run on a more rubbered track. Apparently looking at the F1 app, ALO was compromised on his outlap and radioed in that the team put him out at a wrong time and that the out lap is not going to be ideal and tires wont be working properly. 

Overall they had the pace, the team botched it up by sending out ALO at the wrong time and then ALO made a mistake in turn 1.
Holy fuck. ALO's best sector 1 was 0.6 seconds faster than his Q2's sector one. That would have put him P7. What a shame . Huge mistake, could have easily started P5 with Daniel's penalty and Bottas' being out.
Lol it's not even that. Fernando clearly made a mistake and lost 5/10ths or so. McLaren on raw pace were a Q3 contender. 
Dude it's on the front page FFS.
>When people refer to the Honda "new concept" which did set them back a ton. They mean an entirely new concept as in changing the location of the turbo/compresser (which Honda did) the MGU-H (which Honda also did) these changes were reported on in detail.


Honda's fundamental concept was of split turbo/compressor,they went completely with the Mercedes style layout. It is not an excuse tbh. Honda's issue was not the layout, it was their MGU-H design and the oil tank design. It was also the combustion process that was so bad that the vibrations fucked them up when mated with the gearbox which was not McLaren's fault. 

This new concept talk is bullshit and nothing more than an excuse. Honda massively screwed up and even now they expect to match Renault by the end of the year as if Renault/Ferrari/Mercedes are going to stand still.
I see them being in top 10 barring any issues. 
Spinning out in rain is not always a driver error. A spin in dry conditions is almost always  a driver error but it's not true for rain.

everytime I hear this, I roll my eyes because it makes no sense. Are they really trying to  tell us that McLaren didn't want to give Honda little extra space  but were completely okay with going to Renault who has a much bigger and heavier PU and losing $100mil? I mean c'mon,.

>So Stoffel was the only one of the Renault powered teams who wasn't fuel saving...?

Lol I said "massive fuel saving", at this point I don't think you understand what I am trying to say here. Also I would like a source which says Renault powered cars were fuel saving. 
>, if Stoffel had more fuel left at the end he would have been able to go faster but that still doesn't tell us anything about how fast they're going to be over a full race distance.

If he had more fuel, he would be slower because of the higher fuel load unless he was doing massive fuel saving which I dont think he was. It seems as simple as him just being on a tire that wasn't working well on that day.
>We will see and know within a week if they really are at the front of the field.

They would be 4th fastest at best.

>I however find it rather strange the other analysis not even mentioning such an important detail.

So do I, but McLaren being ranked p7 makes news and clicks and drama but McLaren being ranked p4 doesnt do anything so you get the idea.

Here is the race sim numbers for everyone, see how his pace picks up significantly on mediums and sucks on softs and super softs. 

https://twitter.com/f1debrief/status/972147403393552384
>And about who was that, because as was told, Red Bull was sandbagging big time?

Lol, again, as I said, you need to learn to differentiate between a factual statement and an opinion. Numbers = facts. What you think and what I think = opinion. From the only race sim dad Stoffel did, the moment he put on medium tires , Stoffel was ALMOST on pace of a redbull/ferrari. ALMOST, not similar. Pace on softs sucked. Guys on F1tech/autosport speculated that it might be coz Softs were not working properly or McLaren miscalculated fuel loads but something changed when they put on the medium tires. 


>So you think McLaren is a genuine title contender while Force India and Haas were faster as them...?

Lol, did you even read what I said? I am not giving an "opinion" here. I am stating a fact. The fact is that during the last stint in their race simulation, Stoffel was almost on the pace of RBR/Ferrari on medium tires, it was a race sim so fuel loads would be same, the tires were similar. 

This is not an opinion, it's about numbers, numbers are there for you to see and numbers show that in their last stint, MCL33 was almost as fast as RBR/Ferrari in that particular race sim. I am pretty sure RedBull/Ferrari were holding back but yeah again I am not giving an "OPINION" , I am merely stating what happened, it's on you on what to deduce . Now If you are going to give an opinion to counter a factual statement, go ahead.
>Renault and McLaren about equally as fast in the long runs, but the one lap pace of the McLaren was better (possibly because Renault still didn't get their set up right enough). Toro Rosso fast enough compared to the others on one lap pace, however on the long runs they were lacking 0.5s to Renault and McLaren, but they did a 2 two stop against the others a 3 stop (which might be faster).

Actually it's the average lap time but when Stoffel changed to mediums, his pace was as good as RBR/Ferrari in the last stint, McLaren probably got the tires wrong.
>Pouhon, Spa: Alonso apparentely managed to take Pouhon flat-out in 2017 in practice, but I think he was the only one. 

I think it happened in Quali and it confused the power unit because it didnt know what to do lol. 


EDIT: Yup it was quali. https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alonso-qualifying-spa-honda-mclaren-945396/

You dont know how stubborn those people can be. We get at least 5 posts of these guys posting on /r/pf buying cars they shouldnt be buying and then any advice is ignored. It's a pattern.
THey went from doing less than 40 laps a day in preseason testing last year to being P7 in Spain. They will be fine.
You really must be smoking some really good shit if you think McLaren is going to be slower than STR or Haas. McLaren had a 1 second pace advantage by the end of the season last year , now they have an even more powerful engine.
> RBR’s PR sure was on point, never knew that he was involved right from the start! Would be interesting to find out why RBR tried to downplay Newey’s involvement before the improvements, only for him to ‘retire’ a year later!

I mentioned this  a couple of weeks back and got downvoted because apparently Newey can never be wrong lol.
>  Horner was literally just saying how the new regulations got his “creative juices flowing” yesterday.

He said that exact thing last year before the season started and then the car turned out to be not as expected.
Is he quitting? 

Is he going somewhere else?

Did Ferrari finally manage to get him? 

Probably going to work with Aston Martin more I guess.


That's what I said. McLaren and Renault will finish the top 5. I am not yet sure who will finish P4 though. I'd put my money on McLaren if I had to.
> Maybe they finish 7th, but certainly up into the midfield.

They are not finishing 7th. They will be in the top 5. 

>For me, it's going to be something like this: *4th - McLaren *5th - Toro Rosso *6th - Renault *7th - Hass

Renault McLaren will be in top 5 ie  4th or 5th. I dont see anyone being able to match McLaren's rate of development in that group, not even Renault, last year their development rate was one of the best and they brought new parts in almost every single race and then they have arguably the best driver on the grid, certainly the best driver among McLaren/Renault/Williams/Haas/Force India STR group
"decent upgrade" that's what they said. Not substantial, not significant, not big but decent is the word peter prod used
It's kind of hard to say yet tbh. We do have a general idea about which groups the teams belong in but then McLaren's last stint in race sim yesterday was a surprise for me. I think we are not going to get a solid idea of till Melbourne or maybe today might tell us sometshing.
>well his "shitty ass rumor" was at least half true, they still don't explain all the work the night shift do on the car.

It was a speculation on his part. Teams work at night , all of them do. We don't know how much work is being done on the car in the night shift. It's not like they are working all night on the car and even if Ted was right, I couldn't care less. We need 4 stable manufacturers in f1, however butthurt I am that Honda fucked Alonso/McLaren in 2015-2017, I still want Honda to come good because it's good for the sport or else we would have Lewis winning everything for years to come.
I guess he was talking about debunking Ted's shitty ass rumor.
>Didn't Albert Fabrega debunk this issue?

What "issue" . This is James Key we are talking about. Look up who he is lol.
Probably forgot to hook those sandbags up. lol.  

But to be serious, they were probably on the long tire. Yesterday the mediums clearly worked better or maybe they finally turned up the engine to what Renault and RedBull have been using. Remember, yesterday their speed traps were much lower than RBR and Renault and so basically turning up the engine to the normal levels that other Renault teams are using is possibly the most "layman" explanation. Another being as I said the car just works better on lower fuel levels and medium tires. 

But their pace on that last stint did seem very encouraging. 
>It won’t be they would’ve run low fuel I bet

Jeez, the upvotes to this comment tells me people dont really understand what a "last stint of the race sim means". All cars in their last stint of the race would be low fuel. Sigh.
 [You mean the trick suspension](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/7u2bmk/the_suspension_war_continues_fia_bans_ferraris/) which helped them understand the tires very well and [they also could lower ride height and squat the car like redbull](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/7bwlva/according_to_amus_mclaren_like_red_bull_is_able/), I think it was in Malaysia that Stoffel on cold harder tires pulled a gap of 1 second on Lance Stroll in just sector 2 because of how quickly he could get heat in those tires and In Hungary,the difference in ability to turn on the tires became apparent too when Fernando and Sainz pitted on the same lap and Fernando had like 2 laps to make the move.

According to an early AMuS article last year, McLaren and Ferrari were the only teams who understood tires at the start of the season. Mercedes struggled too and Red Bull suffered the most when their version of trick suspension got banned.


Yup shitty ass trick suspensions, right? 
>I stand corrected, although it seems like the MGU-K was just fine it but was getting killed by being supplied engine oil due to the problem with the oil tank. Still a Honda issue of course but it seems like less of a headache than a fundamental issue with the MGU-K.

No it was the MGU-H that was getting damaged. MGU-K is no where near those components. MGU-K is the energy they regain from braking. It's Kinetic energy.

MGU-H did have fundamental issues with the bearing design and the oil getting into it fucked it  up more.
McLaren supplied energy store and helped with MGU-k. they never failed. It's the MGU-H that was the worst and that was an Honda designed part*
It was of a joint decision tbh. Not just McLaren's or Honda's. Honda fans like to say Honda failed because of McLaren. McLaren fans like to say Honda are just incompetent after so many failures. 

Honda massively underestimated the challenges but I think 2018/2019 might be the year they finally perform the way they should have in 2016/2017.
>The protruding compressor now invaded the space for the oil tank, distorting it’s shape. “Because of that, we faced issues at acc/de-acc and cornering where oil wasn’t properly delivered.

>When a lot of oil was put in to ensure that it was delivered properly, it would flow into the intake duct under certain conditions. The compressor than took in that air resulting in MGU-H. The oil damaged the bearings, scrubbed off the lubricants, thus increasing the temp.
 We predicted these symptoms so we attempted to test them on the bench. They simulated the  G forcesfrom driving and measuring the lubrication of the  oil.”Partly because the sensror was new, we were unable to use it when we wanted to: we ran out of time and testing started. Issues rose at testing which damaged McLaren’s trust in us.

This sums it up and seeing how many MGU-Hs failed in 2017. I have a feeling that issue was never really  completely solved till very late in the season.

On prechamber,

>“Ideally this was something we must have completed before the season started. But McLaren wasn’t willing to wait that long”. Kakuta says with some regret. However a breakthrough is in sight for 2018. 

So Honda were 7-8 months late on their target and when it was introduced, I remember Marumasa posting interviews from Sportiva from Hasegawa saying it didnt perform as expected on the dyno.

It's just a tale of missed target and loss of one partner's trust in another. I wish McLaren had stayed with Honda. It would have been glorious to see Alonso win in the McLaren Honda partnership he grew up idolizing, following his footsteps of his idol ie Ayrton Senna.

They  work often. [Last year McLaren apparently had a trick suspension](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/7u2bmk/the_suspension_war_continues_fia_bans_ferraris/) which helped them understand the tires very well and [they also could lower ride height](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/7bwlva/according_to_amus_mclaren_like_red_bull_is_able/), I think it was in Malaysia that Stoffel on cold harder tires pulled a gap of 1 second on Lance Stroll in just sector 2 because of how quickly he could get heat in those tires and In Hungary,the difference in ability to turn on the tires became apparent too when Fernando and Sainz pitted on the same lap and Fernando had like 2 laps to make the move.

According to an early AMuS article last year, McLaren and Ferrari were the only teams who understood tires at the start of the season. Mercedes struggled too and Red Bull suffered the most when their version of trick suspension got banned.

And a lot of times the tricks get banned .
I really hope it's not a repeat of 2014 butterfly suspension lol but, the more I read on McLaren's car, the more it makes me feel that car is deceptively simple as in it might look bare and underdeveloped (as Scarbs calls it LOL) but it has the most complex rear wing of any team, their front wing is an evolution of their 2017 wing which apparently took a direction that hasn't been taken before ,the barge board area is one of the most complex too.  

I really hope they surprise us come Melbourne (and not in a bad way). 
> I'd argue that McLaren themselves haven't actually been that vocal about their chassis but pundits and commentators have done it for them.
> 
> 

McLaren's director ie Jonathan Neale specifically refused to admit that they had the "best" chassis when Ted asked him on live TV. Yesterday Eric B. did the same thing, he said I cant answer that question and you will have to wait till Australia to see it but you can back and ask me that again next week.

It's the media and everyone else who has basically mis-quoted Alonso 
(who has admittedly said ONCE they were fastest in corner but he did say that they still had some work to do in low speed corners to be up tthere with top guys) and McLaren personnel.

> Alonso said, regardless of how much they run, all the data is shared by renualt from Red Bull & themselves to McLaren and vice versa. Customer engine perk I suppose.

Engine data is shared not chassis data. I would like a source though. The data shared by teams wont have any effect on chassis performance.
> The only truth right now really is McLaren will have nowhere to hide this year. The must aim to match both Red Bull & Renualt and then beat them. Let's wait and see.

I honestly dont understand how anyone could rationally expect McLaren to match RedBull. RedBull has been a pseudo-works team for Renault since years, they have the most experience with Renault PUs in the hybrid era. McLaren on the other hand hasn't even gone through one full race weekend. Hell, it was even confirmed by Tim Goss that McLaren is going to run a conservative cooling packaging recommended by Renault this year and won't do anything aggressive/crazy till next year.

I have seen touring go for 30k+TTL. It's not a bad idea to pay $2000 more right now vs buying the cars you are looking at. Accords have much lower depreciation than Hyundais or Chevrolet so it kinda makes up for high price.
>honestly, price. I'm looking at $35k MSRP.. which is way too steep

Accord 1.5T EX-L and Accord 2.0T Sport (which is basically same as 1.5T EX-L  but more powerful and has better transmission) both will be under 30k OTD. Accords go for 10-12% off MSRP. 

I have seen 18 Accord EX go for ~$24k+TTL and EX-L go for high 26s low 27s.


Even Civic Touring trim will have almost everything you want and they go for 8-10% off and even more.
>Just above your budget but a 2018 Honda Accord 2.0T

2018 Honda Accord Sport 2.0T is under his budget. Accords are going for 10-12%+ off on MSRP. 
>oil-leak

It was a fuel leak.
>  they have stated that they have the best chassis iirc

You recall wrong. J.Neale said they have a chassis that is much better than results show. Then Ted asked him on live if that meant their chassis was the best or with a non Honda engine it would be fighting for wins and J.Neale said that's a trick question and I am not going to answer that .

I do not  think you should buy it. Financially it's not a good decision. When I became an attending (>$250k a year), the first car I bought was a loaded Accord which cost less than the car you are planning to buy and I had no debt and already had a decent amount of savings from my residency years.  You have both, debt and a very small savings, you lack an emergency fund too.

Do you NEED a Wrangler? Why are you not looking at something more economical? You make more or less equal to America's median household income, buying a new Jeep, brand new with no downpayment means you will be underwater as soon as you drive out of the lot and then the "amazing" reliability that these cars are known for. Well good luck ,I guess.

Why not buy something like this,

>Wouldn't mind a 2014 or 2015 Corolla, seeing as there have been very few changes made compared to the 2016 model.

Yeah, that's why I mentioned 2014+. Keep lookin for one, you will be able to get that low mileage , they come up very often.
I feel it's a bit high. I have seen 2014-2015 Corollas with half the number of miles go for that much often.
>considering the anchor as an engine last year and still get to points, I'd say better.

That's a far cry. We dont know if it was better.  But we do know it wasn't a bad chassis, it was most certainly the best chassis to come out of Woking since 2012. Alonso was very fast in Hungary, as Sainz said he was on the pace of front runners.
How is it your dad's fault? It's your fault, not his. You spent the money, he didn't.

Call Recon.  
I would get a very low mileage 2015+ Corolla if I was netting 4k a month. They can be had for 12-13k for <20-25k miles and will last you a long time.
I agree. But tbh, LX trim sucks anyway. EX is the lowest I would go for.
17k Civic LX 30k miles is a very shitty deal. New Civic LX are selling for ~18k nowadays.

Corolla is a better deal.
Depends on the trim level.

No. Not a chance. Lenders need income. They wont give you money unless you have the income and you can prove you will pay it back.Having said that NC is cheap, you can get pretty big houses there with a relatively smaller budget.
> In my first comment, i did tell you "since 2015" i am aware this pic is from 2015, thats why i said that.
> 
> 

My point is Ferrari, Honda and Renault have had a huge change in their PU after 2015 so by saying  "since 2015" and implying that the diagram you showed is still accurate is factually wrong in itself. That diagram was right for 2015. Not for 2016 and certainly not for 2017. Ferrari revamped their PU greatly for 2017 if you remember. Honda basically went ahead and copied Mercedes as much as they could. 

"Since 2015" and "In 2015" are two different things.  


That's an older pic, from 2015.It's not accurate right now. Neither Honda looks like that, nor does the 2017 Ferrari PU look like that. Renault has been revamped too. You just proved my point on why this is a wrong place for 

Now here is my question to you,  Are you telling me Tim Goss, who is the technical director of McLaren is wrong in saying that Honda/Mercedes are similar architecture and Renault/Ferrari are similar?

I mean a technical director of a team that has used 3 out of 4 PUs in the hybrid era would know more than you and me, no?
>Ferrari uses a split layout aswell since 2015..

>while Ferrari's split is simply has the MGU-h between the compressor and the turbine while keeping both parts on the same side of the engine. Renault is the one with the traditional setup.

Not completely true.  The way you are saying, all of them will be "split" which is not what's being discussed here. The entire "split turbo" thing comes from Turbo and Compressor being on two different sides of the engine and that only Honda and Mercedes has. Both Renault/Ferrari are traditional ie turbo and compressor on same side of the engine.

Here is what McLaren's Technical Director said,

>"The Renault architecture is very different," Goss told Autosport.

>"You have two fundamental engine architectures out there. You have the Mercedes/Honda approach, and you have got the Ferrari/Renault approach.

>"Essentially the difference comes down to where the turbocharger sits.

>"The Mercedes/Honda approach is you have the compressor on the front of the engine, the turbine on the back of the engine and the MGU-H sat in the middle of the V.

>"The Ferrari/Renault approach is that you have got the compressor sat at the back of the engine, the MGU-H behind it and the turbine behind that.

[Shows me -4](https://imgur.com/a/W9xm0). Well. Anyway this is not that comment, I said I made two comments and both of them were downvoted, the other one was at -7 or so, I just cant find it right now. It was also longer than this one.

About not being specific, I was responding to a guy saying Mercedes uses similar set up as Ferrari. I was specific enough to debunk that comment  and also anyone who follows F1 relatively closely knows Mercedes uses a split layout, it has been spoken of atleast once per weekend or two since 2014. 


I made two comments on this layout topic that I remember. Both of them were downvoted, [Here is one of them](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/6z5yd8/whats_the_main_reason_honda_started_a_new_concept/dmsurhy/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=formula1)  You know it's not edited because you dont see that "*" besides the time stamp.
>but there's more exposure here,

Lol, you will still have more educated responses on f1tech vs here. This is a place full of arm chair idiots. I remember posting something about PU layouts for Mercedes/Honda and Renault/Ferrari being similar that was discussed to death on F1tech and recently even by Tim Goss (McLaren's TD) and I was DOWNVOTED into oblivion. 

Go to F1tech and you will get less total responses but there will be more educated responses than here.

You don't have to wait. I just moved to AAA and now I pay ~60% less than anyone else offered me. IL State laws mandate insurance companies to issue prorated refund if you cancel and they are not allowed to charge any early cancellation fees.

It's not considered a taboo, it's just that over past one week, we have had SO MANY of these threads that it kinda starts bordering on spam level!
Where have you been for past 5 days?
> I think there is no doubt Renault engine is not a handicap anymore.

And you are basing this on a rumor?
>I'm hoping all the talk about having one of the best chasis' on the grid were legit 

They never explicitly even once said "best chassis". Not even once. Jonathan Neale said It's good enough to be much higher than their results show and then when Ted asked so if you had Mercedes PU you would be winning? And he said that's a trick question and I am not going to answer that.
Please be true + Somehow MCL33 is a very good car + Alonso in top form = Profit?
Kimoa Fernando Alonso McLaren Racing. 


Fernando's ultimate revenge on Ron Dennis ie conquer McLaren.
He never said he'd win in a McLaren. He said He would win in 2018. I see that happening with Toyota.
>Unless Renault builds a killer chassis that's what's gonna happen.

Remember who Renault signed this year?
>"Coming off of ninth in the championship last year, it doesn't make selling partners any easier, so if we can quickly demonstrate we are no longer a ninth-placed team, that will just build on itself."

3 sponsors (4 tbh) with McLaren being P9 in 2017. If 2018 is good enough, I can easily a lot more new sponsors.
clickbait bruh. clickbait. Did it's job.

Look into Fidelity. They offer funds which are comparable to Vanguard on a lot of levels and Fidelity is open for Non-Resident Aliens.
>True but just as a rule of thumb, on a yearly basis nothing can match 100% employer contribution right? 30% return is hard to beat right? Apart from it being illiquid what are the downsides?

The match is not vested immediately. Different companies have different vesting schedules and you need to be with them for a considerable amount of time for the entire amount to vest, which is often longer than 5 years.
>Honestly, why not? The website just says something along the lines of "start investing with as little as $1000"

You are a non-resident alien. Vanguard afaik doesn't allow non resident aliens to open account with them. 
>So Vanguard has a minimum of $1000 needed to invest right. Is this an optimal plan for the next ~3 years? 1. Match 401k 2. Keep ~4k in savings 3. Aggressively pay off loans 4. Invest the remained in a vanguard ETF


You wont be able to open a Vanguard account afaik. Look into fidelity.
>He only had a few more laps to go when he abandoned the car.

He didnt. Drive shaft broke while he was P9/P10. Hasegawa said it himself to Japanese media. You can go to autosport forums in the mcl32 thread and look up posts and translations by "Marumasa" . This Alonso retired the car bullshit is nothing more than bullshit. 
Yup this.
I dont know man, I love Honda Sensing on my accord and this is coming from a guy who owns a Model S with Autopilot. It's amazing how good affordable cars have gotten now. 
> but instead he drove into the accident.

Not really. More like the accident drove into him, a split second later and he would have been P2 in the race.
But don't you think that even if McLaren forced Honda to do something, Honda would have said no if they found demands to be unreasonable? 

Dont you think that if small size of the PU was an issue, they wouldn't make it even more smaller a year later?
That podium he missed in Singapore or atleast a P4 frustrates me even today.
Google home + Smartthings is what I use.
I am doing this!

You can try selling yours on /r/hardwareswap or Swappa.
> You can change the layout of an engine and still make it lighter and better packaged, it's a completely different engine design. They didn't just take all the existing parts and move them around, what nonsense is this?
> 
> 

You missed his point. He said, the PU became smaller so this whole forced on Honda size zero concept that you and a lot of people claim was aborted was never aborted into it's true sense per se because the PU got smaller from 2016 to 2017 and Honda's failure had nothing to do with the so called "size-zero"especially when Honda decided to build a whole new PU that was ever smaller in size than their older concept which you claim failed because McLaren forced Honda to make it small.
Dude, Wazari claims a lot of shit. I post on F1tech once in a while. Over last 3 years, I have tried trusting him a lot of times but then he says something and then it gets proven wrong and that happens a lot of times . He has always bashed McLaren and are you really trusting an anonymous poster on internet over Arai who was the head of Honda's F1 program back in 2015? 
I think that’s what It is.
I have the iPhone X! 

I have been an iOS user since 2008. Tried Android when S2 was released, kept that phone as my secondary phone for 7-8 months. Android was "behind" at that time and then I got the Nexus 5 for my mom, it improved but I prefered iOS because Android felt less refined! 

In december I got the Pixel 2 XL and I was pleasantly surprised and while I prefer iOS app quality and Safari over Android app quality and browsers on Android and miss iMessage, I feel like Android is a better OS than iOS right now and I really wanna use something else for a change, iOS feels so stangnant!


>ps. How much would you sell your XL 2 for ?

IDK! I am not sure if I would sell it yet but if I can get a decently priced like new Pixel 2, I might let it go.
What price are you lookin at for this?
Credit card are perfect if you are responsible. You get a free loan for 30 days, you get cashback, you get benefits like extended warranty, purchase protection and you dont put your bank account in a position to be compromised. I would never use a debit card anywhere unless I need cash from an ATM. 

Credit cards with autopay full balance ftw.
You can easily get a nice low mileage car for 10-12k as someone else posted. It will have everything including a touch screen, 6 speakers, climate control and all that and it will cost you less than $150/mo. It's a no brainer. 

Even the banks, who are very leniant these days with giving out loans dont want you to buy that car, it's kinda telling,no?
You cant afford that car.  But looking at your responses, I don't think you are going to like that answer.
>Yeah it's pending. It's kind of a long wait but I think he's for sure buying.

I mean, I would pay you the $$ right now!   You dont have to wait or anything, you get the $ instantly. ;)
"we" didn't send a Tesla to Mars. Elon Musk did.
>I don't have the metrics but i'd disagree (excluding reliability and maybe driveability) in that the Honda unit was worse than any 2014 power unit.

You missed the point. The point is OVERALL, no other PU was as bad as the Honda PU was in 2017 comparatively. This is not a straight up comparision of 2017 and 2014 PUs.  

What I am saying is no other PU, not even the 2014 Renault PU was as bad compared to Mercedes 2014 PU as Honda was in their 3rd year . Even the unreliable 2014 Renault in it's first year was more reliable than Honda was in it's 3rd year. I hope that makes things better.
>  How you can be over 1 year behind and expect to ever catch up is beyond me. That extra pressure probably led to Honda constantly doubting their work and re-evaluating designs that just needed further development.

There is a difference between catching up and not being shit. You need to realize that no other PU was that bad in 2014 as Honda was in 2017. By 2017 Honda had more experience than everyone else had in 2014. Honda could have had a reliable competitive PU which while not being world beater could actually perform well and not break down every other race.
> I found a 2012 Prius for 12k with 71k miles on it. How much is insurance for a used vehicle in (probably) good condition?

Why do you wanna get a 2012 Prius with 71k miles on it which is a generation old model when you can get a newer generation 2014+ Corolla with <30k mile for that similar price? [here](https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/inventorylisting/viewDetailsFilterViewInventoryListing.action?sourceContext=carGurusHomePage_false_0&entitySelectingHelper.selectedEntity=d295&zip=55057#listing=197492498)

Insurance depends on your age,history, location and a million other things.
What I figured from it that McLaren actually thought Honda was going to produce a winner this year and it dawned to them during the first fireup and then the tests that this would be even worse than 2015,2016.  There was clearly a gap in communication and that was evidenced by the fact that Honda didnt have the correct pins to install the PU with the gearbox and the young Japanese guy's reaction to that particular incident spoke volumes. 

You can very clearly see the mood in McLaren camp go from "We are going to win or be competitive this year" to "We are fucked".
>I hadn’t thought of 7yr financing on a Lamborghini...time to hit up that luxury imports dealership!

I have seen some exotic car lending companies offer 144 month loans ie 12 years and there are some idiots who actually do it.
>Oh I might add my current interest rate is 2.6% and the truck would be 0.99%

Still. If you cant afford that truck on a shorter term, you shouldnt be buying it. I can afford a Lamborghini on a 7 year loan, doesnt mean I am going to go and get it lol.
>I thiiiiink my credit is good or at least average. Truth be told, I haven't checked, but I've had and used a credit card consistently since age 17 (22 now), and haven't missed or paid late ever.

Make an account on creditkarma and report back!
>Because I know that I'd be paying significantly more than whatever monthly payment plan they have, would the potentially higher interest rate be an issue?

If you credit is in 700s, you will most likely get the best rates. ~2.5%, with 2.5% interest, there is no point in aggressively paying down the loan.

What's your zip?

>Can I still put money into Roth for 2017? Is Schwab a good choice?

Yes you can. Schwab/Fidelity/Vanguard all are good choices.
>Is this a smart move?

no. 7 years finance on a car lol. Talk about getting ripped off.
>Find a used car in the 10-13k range, and do some sort of financing, but aggressively pay off the loan so its basically paid off by fall of 2018.

Thats not a bad idea, but that depends on your credit. 

For you, a low mileage 2014+ Corolla is what I would recommend. Very easy to get one with lessa than 25-30k miles on it in your price range.
Depends on your car loan interest and your income

Lenders like low DTI. So a car payment of $300/mo on a $10k wont make a big difference. But a car payment of $300/mo on $2500/mo income will.
I already  gave you the options!

Set aside 6-9  months of expenses.Put it in a high yield savings account.

For the rest of the money invest it in Vanguard LifeStrategy Conservative Growth Fund. With $300k you can basically have more than enough downpayment buy a gas station that will have six figures profit.
Why do you have $300k in savings and not invested?

Dont change your budget at all.

What you need to do is increase your 401k contribution.

You need to set aside  6 months of expenses in a  HY savings account and invest rest of the money in something like Vanguard LifeStrategy funds. 
You are spending too much.

I made $55k in my first year residency in NYC and I had similar expenses.

Where are you located?

If you dont have 401k plan, you can put money in Trad IRA. But seeing your income now and because it's low and you are most likely to have a higher income in your retirement, roth might be a better idea till you complete residency.
Look on Cargurus for slightly used ones and you will get your answer.

I don’t think you can. Why is she not here with you?


Still pending? 

I would pay $$ right now ;)
>4) Are these cards for the general public? Haha. What are good cards with annual fees?

Chase Sapphire Reserve. Hands down for me. $450 annual fee. $300 travel credit. $100 Global Entry/TSA Pre Credit, Lounge Access via Priority Pass and combined with Chase Freedom, it's the card to have.

Maxima is a $35000 car. But yeah your money.

>Do you have any advice about where I should put my cash? If not, please give the car argument a rest.


First you ask for advice and then you kinda uhmm.. get a bit jumpy when we point out what's wrong.


>Do you have any advice about where I should put my cash?

HY savings/bonds.
I did. I bought a million dollar condo and I took my Honda Accord to the closing. 
It's their loss if they dont take you seriously.

As I said, you dont NEED a $600/mo car. You can get something cheaper and it's not going to make much difference.

[Something like this](https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/inventorylisting/viewDetailsFilterViewInventoryListing.action?sourceContext=&newSearchFromOverviewPage=true&inventorySearchWidgetType=AUTO&entitySelectingHelper.selectedEntity=d242&entitySelectingHelper.selectedEntity2=&zip=80294&distance=50&searchChanged=true&modelChanged=true&filtersModified=true#listing=198286845) is cheaper and you get that nice car feeling.

Anyway you have done a good job.Make sure you dont fall back into bad habits and run up a debt!

> Still looking at buying the second car mid-year (no more than a $600/month payment). 

Too much. You can get new cars for 350/mo.

If you need to have something nicer , very low mileage Maximas cost 23-25k. Slap on a nissan  extended warranty for 1500 or so and you are set for a long time.
Alliant is good. You cant go wrong with it.
I remember posting this last year and I was downvoted by the experts here. 
>The fusion was actually only 19k after rebates. I was underwater 7k with my previous vehicle. The decision to purchase new was really the mistake there.

Now you are underwater again.  See why you are trapped in a shitty place?
>Before my current vehicle I had two other older, high milage vehicles, One over 120k and the other almost 200k. 

You dont have to get a car with $120k miles on it.

A 2014+ Corolla with low miles(<25k) costs $12k or so and your payments will be less than $200/mo. 


It's more reliable than a ford that you drive right now.  
>Can I ask what you industry/job title is?

I am a doctor.
You still have this?
Still got this?
Emergency fund ie 6 months expenses in high yield savings account with Discover/Ally.

Rest of the money in a Roth IRA for 2017 and 2018 with Vanguard. If I were you I would put that $8700 in Roth ASAP.
>are there any legit, nonscam ways to get a working car with bad credit?

Yeah, pay cash. 
>Rent your flat to geeks/nerds. They never do such shit. Trust me, as I am one! and I rent lol.

You dont . This buy on cash is over-simplified advice. If you qualify for top rate,  just finance it.
> A crv isn’t some grandiose choice but a brand new car will lose so much money.

2017 CR-Vs go for ~2k less than new ones. They dont depreciate much at All, it's bizarre what newer Hondas are priced at.

For eg [this](https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/inventorylisting/viewDetailsFilterViewInventoryListing.action?sourceContext=carGurusHomePage_false_0&newSearchFromOverviewPage=true&inventorySearchWidgetType=AUTO&entitySelectingHelper.selectedEntity=c26423&entitySelectingHelper.selectedEntity2=&zip=60606&distance=50&searchChanged=true&modelChanged=false&filtersModified=true#listing=198450090) This is more or less a new 2018 price.

or [this](https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/inventorylisting/viewDetailsFilterViewInventoryListing.action?sourceContext=carGurusHomePage_false_0&newSearchFromOverviewPage=true&inventorySearchWidgetType=AUTO&entitySelectingHelper.selectedEntity=c26423&entitySelectingHelper.selectedEntity2=&zip=60606&distance=50&searchChanged=true&modelChanged=false&filtersModified=true#listing=198319007) which again is basically 300-500 off a new 2018 EX. 
>>2018 Accord 2.0T!!!

That's going to cost ~$30k OTD. OP wants something in $20k.
>6-7% is not a guaranteed return, it's a long-term average. I'd expect someone making 300k/yr and boasting of investing savvy to know that.

I know that lol and that's why I said Invest in low risk funds or if you are risk averse then just get municipal bonds or CDs. Nothing wrong in taking out a 1.99% car loan for 5 years and then investing that cash in 2.5-2.6% CD.   



>, I'm going to assume you have purchased new cars. Can I ask, how do you factor depreciation into this?

Only the Accord was new. Model S was used with 1900 miles on it lol but I got a really good rate with my local CU @ 1.99% and car was priced 6500 lower than MSRP. Lexus is a CPO and financed with Lexus Financial Services. 

CPOs can be had for good rates. eg. Mercedes is running a 1.99% APR  on their CPOs right now. BMW is running 1.49% on 3 series and 5 series CPOs and 0.9% on i3s.
>And keep an eye out for the occasional 0-2% sale on certified pre-owned (otherwise known as shinier newer used cars). Then you get free financing, keep your investments earning, and avoid the drive-it-off-the-lot-depreciation hit you’d get on a new car.


Yup. Mercedes has this going on right now @ 1.99%. For Luxury cars especially buying the CPOs save you a lot of money. My Lexus was a CPO and is financed at 1.9% haha!
>Got some extra money, where should it go?

Depends on how long you want your money invested.
The answer is no.

Having said that, put more on it. You will get more points. Put it on autopay.
>You are not making a profit! You would still have been better off NOT buying $150k of cars and buying one or two $6k cars.

Why would I drive a $6k car when my total compensation with bonuses and benefits exceed $300k a year? I save >$100k a year and max out my 403b and 457b accounts. I also max out my back door roth and I am on track to retire before I am 40 live the rest of my life making six figures from my investments without having to worry about anything. I dont see a point in saving any more than I already do. I have worked hard to be able to afford the life I live and I didnt do that to drive cars with 100k miles on them. 
>I have a 03 1500. Paid 2800 for it. Had alot of dents and rust, for 1100 had it repainted and fixed to help with temptation but it comes and goes...

That's not the question! I am not against buying a nicer/newer car. My question is Do you NEED a truck? A lot of people who drive trucks dont really need one.  Does it have to be a truck? If yes , why?
Did you talk to them over the email about this.

Send them an email so you have the proof.
>And if your Investments lost money would you be bragging about your car loans today?

If and buts, the matter of fact is I am $36k up on a balanced fund. You can invest in a much more conservative fund and you would almost always come out ahead. My most expensive loan is 1.99% , over 5 years even CDs give you 2.5%, tax free municipal bonds would give you 3-5.5%. It's a matter of having the know how to invest. 

I know I wont lose money on a 0.9%-1.99% loan .
0.9-1.99 on 3 cars. I still make a decent profit.
 
I would never finance a car at 4%, I have a 800+ credit score, I anyway qualify for top rates .
>I didn't submit anything in writing. I might try putting everything in writing and going in again.

You get it in writing FROM them. 
Ally,discover,Amex,Marcus by GS,synchrony or a credit union like Alliant. 

All of these have HY savings accounts where you put the emergency fund.
Did you take anything in writing?  You might want to get a bit assertive and take things in writing and go in to the dealership.

This might be a /r/legal question.
Prius @ $20k will get you a low mileage CPO. Get a CPO.

[here is one] (https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/inventorylisting/viewDetailsFilterViewInventoryListing.action?sourceContext=&newSearchFromOverviewPage=true&inventorySearchWidgetType=AUTO&entitySelectingHelper.selectedEntity=d15&entitySelectingHelper.selectedEntity2=&zip=90210&distance=75&searchChanged=true&modelChanged=false&filtersModified=true#listing=197231546)

>Is leasing a smart financial decision? 

Depends but usually not. Leasing makes sense only if you can get crazy high residuals with very low MF which takes a lot of work and luck. 

>And finally, how can I get the best deal for my insurance?

Shop around. AAA,nationwide,geico,metlife,Progressive,liberty mutual,statefarm and others.



What's your budget?

How is your credit?
Okay I am in the "paying for car in full is a dumb decision" camp with a conditions apply ie your income and credit.

Paying for car is a dumb decision if you have the credit to qualify for a car loan that will give you top tier rates. New car loans are as low as 0-1.99%, used car loans can be as low as 2.29% or even lower. In those cases you are leaving money on the table by paying in cash.
> What kind of doctor are you, if you don't mind me asking?

I am an internist :)

> I've read a lot about choosing high-quality surgeons, but am always open to tips.


The thing with that is it's easy for someone like me or another doctors who have actually worked or seen these surgeons work and because of that me giving you a tip on how to chose a doctor is going to be useless because you dont have access to the "behind the scenes" stuff like I do lol.
Do you NEED a truck or do you WANT a truck?


> Promise yourself you will only buy a vehicle with cash. 

Why would you pay cash for a vehicle if you qualify for the top credit tier rates? You are throwing money away by paying cash on a new vehicle if you have stellar credit. New car loans are 0-1.99% which is basically free money, even CDs make more money than that, bonds will make even more.

Paying cash makes sense only when the credit sucks .
2014+ Corollas can be had for 11-12k for low mileage ones. Go for that.

Used for CPO/Used cars on cars.com and cargurus.com.
Your plan looks good. Doctor here btw, make sure you go to a good surgeon for your nose. A bad rhinoplasty would look bad. You need skilled hands! 

Also you can reduce that phone budget to to $35/mo by using Cricket which AT&T's prepaid service.. That's another $1000/yr.
>  I lose only when I pull out if the market is at a low, correct?

Yes. Over 2-3 decades, there is a very low chance of losing anything though unless there is an unprecedented catastrophic financial crash. If you risk-averse, you can put the money in bonds.
18 Accord Sport fits your budget and tbh is the car I would get. Accord Sport can be had for ~22.5k-22.8k. Where are you located?  Accord Sport has much better features than the LX especially the Infotainment system.
RAV4. CPO Rav4s with low mileage can be had for less than 20k easily. CR-Vs have inflated resale values just like every Honda out there.
I know this is not /r/pf but buying $30k car on a $52k income is not a good decision . You are spending over 70% of your take home pay on a car. 

Also if you want a car to last you that long without any major issues, get a non-performance oriented commuter car. WRX is the best fit. Civic Si is another option.

Manual transmissions can be a pain in the ass while commuting especially if the route consists of stop and go traffic.
Get liability only!

Make sure you get quotes from everyone including AAA. I just switched from nationwide to AAA and my insurance has dropped by 40%.
 The all new 10th generation Accord in EX-L trim(2.0t 10 speed or 1.5t CVT) is a better car than the 2015 TLX. Ofcourse you dont get AWD but it has much more bells and whistles and is very comfortable. It also has Android Auto and Apple Carplay and when I test drove it, I really liked the infotainment system. 
So you would be spending 36% of your take home pay in rent which tbh is high and you havent even considered the utility expenses yet.

Get a 2bd apartment with someone. It would be cheaper, you would get a bigger nicer place. A shared 2bd apartment is always going to be cheaper than 1bd apartment by yourself.
> You stated above you don't have credit so how do you have top tier credit? Honestly, if you can't pay cash for the car you probably shouldn't buy it. The rule of thumb is the value of everything you own with a motor in it shouldn't exceed half of your income.

You are replying to the wrong person. I have a 816 Credit score and I am a physician making >$250k a year , I am not the OP.
> Buy a car for cash and save yourself 66 months of regret. Those $400 payments could be applied to any debts you have, a 3-6 month emergency fund and finally your next nicer cash car.
> 
> 

As someone who has >$150k worth of cars, I would never ever pay cash for my cars. Credit is still cheap for people with top tier credit, take that loan, invest your cash and you will come out ahead over 5 years in 9/10 cases. My $152k invested has generated $37k in returns over 3 years, enough to pay for my next car. If i had paid cash, I would have lost on $37k.
then pay $25k cash. Get a secured car and build credit. You dont have to pay the shitty interest on autoloan to build credit.
It's more than I would want at that income. If I was making $160k, the most I would spend is $400k.

The problem here is your DTI will be so high that you will be living paycheck to paycheck for a veyr long time.
You would be paying $3000+26400 = $29400. Shitty deal but that has to do with your credit. You cant afford that car.
What's your monthly take home?
Amex 

Ally

Discover

CapitalOne MoneyMarket Account.

All of these will give you very good rates.
I just mentioned this in another thread. I used to live in Brooklyn @ $55k during my residency years.

>but I do not want to live with other people any more/in are

I know you said this but what I would do is get a 2bd with a friend or someone living with you. A 2bd with a roommate is always cheaper than a 1bd or a studio by yourself. That would cut your expense greatly.

You already get a metrocard so that wont be an issue.

Dont buy a car, you dont really need one.

Food, learn to cook. Eating out can get expensive.

Apart from that there is not much you can do. If you insist on living alone, your expenses will be higher

I am not sure how anyone would be able to help you make a decision here but I was in your place, I would get another car (not a Fiesta ST though lol) but then I am not the most frugal person out there.

It's your decision at the end of the day.
Secured card. 

YOU SHOULD NEVER EVER CARRY A BALANCE ON YOUR CARD, have an emergency fund for the hard times.

Both Capitalone and Discover secured cards are good.
The problem with that is 3k/mo would get you a mansion in 80% of America. A decent house in almost everywhere else but you are going to SF and that is where it's not going to be enough.

Do you HAVE to move to SF? 
>I think you'd be happy with that decision, especially if you enjoy the 2015

I mean dont really "enjoy"  it. I enjoy the Tesla a lot more, it's a good car nonetheless. Does it's job well but as I said since I got the model S, it has been kinda ignored lol.  I am gonna test drive the touring trim soon. I have heard good things about it and the 2.0t is a fast car, as I have grown up, I have realized that driving $100k cars is a waste of money and you can be completely content with a $30-35k car.
I make that much. I would be comfortable with ~$3k-3.5k/mo at the most.  Now the problem here is you are moving to Bay Area which kinda skews things.

Also you dont need $170k in cash unless you are saving up for downpayment. Make sure you max out your Backdoor Roth IRAs and not tradition IRA.
>The 2018 Accord is awesome. Bought one myself a month ago and I love it.

I am looking into one. I have a 2015 Accord EX-L that I got when I finished residency. I dont use it much these days after I got a Model S , was thinking of selling them both off and leasing a Accord Touring 2.0t. Just waiting for Honda to come up with a decent lease deal.
>Genuine curiosity here...but when you see cases like this, one could assume the majority of the time the person is already ill correct?

True.

>Not that I don't expect some people to abandon the elderly who are still healthy as well.

People are shitty in general and they get shittier during adverse times.

>What's the procedure like on something like this? Normally I'd assume obviously have a next of kin contact or something, but that's not really applicable here.


Look into something called elder abandonment. 
>If I had to buy something now, I'd look at Honda Civic or Nissan Altima - nissans tend to be a bit less than toyotas and hondas, but I love mine


2018 Accord is a much nicer car. Look into it!
As a doctor, I am all for it. I have seen old people abandoned by their families who suffer a lot. It should be made legal and made as humane as possible.
> A lot of questions here boil down to "I make 50K/year, and spend $500/month on eating out, $500/month on student loans, $1400/month on my apartment, and have $10,000 in credit card debt. Can I afford a new Subaru WRX?"

Most. 8 out of 10 questions are like that tbh.
>That's an OLED thing.

Use an iPhone X for a day and tell me it's an OLED thing. :)
>it was deposited the 19th

So you got like 10 days of interest from the day the funds became available.
You should have been more specific.
>Source: lived frugally for 10 years from 31-41. Retired at 41 because of returns on investments in just those 10 years.


Broad statement. You can make 1mil/yr for 10 years, live frugally and retire within 3-4 years. 

You can make 50k a year, live frugally and you maybe able to retire in your 50s.
During my residency years, I used to live in Brooklyn on 57k. It's not that hard.  

Right now I make 5 times as much and my monthly expense still doesn't go over 5-5.5k a month and I don't even bother to budget or
live frugally and eat out a LOT. 

$55k is not a bare minimum for a single person but it is "bare minimum" for a single person to live a decently comfortable life in almost anywhere in USA apart from West Coast.

> Buying a new car has just always seemed so taboo when you're trying to be responsible.

It's the sub that makes it a taboo. People here will recommend $5k car to someone making $200k a year if they could. 

You should buy whatever you like as long as you are not getting ripped or overpaying for it. You should also not finance a car unless you qualify for best interest rates ie <2.5-3%.

I would recommend you look into RAV4 though. I have seen very low mileage RAV4s go for 16-18k and they mechanically superior to Fords and has consistently topped reliability ratings are generally much better vehicles.

Fords also depreciate a lot. I am sure you would be able to find a cheap low mileage escape but for non-luxury consumer car I prefer to stick to Toyota/Honda or Subaru. I tend to avoid almost everything else.
Utilities should be on autopay. Tell your roommate to remove your name if he refuses to pay them on autopay.
On some cars, buying new makes sense. On some it doesnt.

Used Hondas especially are priced so close to new ones to new ones that paying a 1000-1500 makes complete sense because a new one will also have 0.9% APR for top tier credit and it ends up being very close. for eg. I just saw a CPO 2017 Civic Touring at 24750, I got a quote for new 2018 Civic Touring at $25k + 0.9% APR, the new one ends up being cheaper even if I negotiate on the CPO price.

40k miles on a ford vs $4k for a brand new car and 0% APR, for me I would go with a new one.
1)6 months of emergency fund if you dont have one and have no debts. If you have high interest debt, attack that first.

2)IRA or Roth IRA depending on whether you are eligible for trad IRA deduction.
>I saw some Dell Latitudes being sold as refurbs on eBay. Where else can I buy Dell refurbs?


I have no idea about India. But outside of India, Dell officially sells refurbs on their dell outlet store front.

http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/22/campaigns/outlet
The only two COMPANIES I would buy Refurbs are Apple and Dell. Both provide same warranties as they provide on new computers with ability to purchase an extended warranty.

No one else sells good refurbs, eBay sellers definitely dont. Refurbs on eBay = Used.
Look into nationwide. I have always had lower rates with them. I pay $200/mo for Tesla Model S whereas everyone quoted me over 300.

 You should be able to get a good rate with them.

But your age matters a lot here.
MetroPCS is owned by Tmobile so uses Tmobile network. $50 for unlimited data,talk text.

Cricket is owned by AT&T and use AT&T network. 5GB high speed and then unlimited data at slower speed and UL talk text @ $35/mo. $55/mo for a truly unlimited high speed data plan.

Straight-talk is a Verizon MVNO. 

You wont need to give up your iPhone 6. iPhones on Verizon are anyway unlocked. Go with any of the above mentioned  and you wont go wrong with them.
I had credit card protection. I got $75 back from them. Google also gave me $75+tax back ie $80 or so lol.
Yup. I contacted them on chat. Took 3 tries.  ThenI got money back using my card too.
I dont see why Google would help you out here.

If you bought your phone using a decent credit card and if it's still within 90 days, look into your card's purchase protection. 

Did you pay in full using a credit card?
The screen broke because the phone fell screen first. You need a screen protector to protect the screen. A case wont protect your screen when the screen has a direct impact.
>That's just not true. HTC made the smaller one, and HTC is incapable of making a small bezeled phone


Google tells HTC what to make. It's a google branded phone. HTC is the one who Google has contracted to manufacture the phone they "designed".  They are a glorified foxconn to Google.
> Genuine question, why are you trying so hard to like and switch to Android if the iPhone was working fine for your needs?

I buy a new iPhone every year. I have been using the same form factor since iPhone 6,that changed with iPhone X but the iOS still feels the same as it did with iOS 7. The notification system has been a blunder since they removed group by app option last year. 

Basically because iOS has been stagnant.

For me the perfect phone right now is the iPhone X with stock android and iOS quality apps + Safari. LOL.

> my Pixel 2 is ridiculously overpriced for what it offers next to the competition,

I feel the Pixel 2 XL is not worth $900(with tax). That phone doesnt look like a $900 phone. I personally paid a ridiculously low price for the phone via some serious hustling. Bought it full price, ported in to sprint , received ~$500 in rebates lol, then Google dropped the price and I got them to refund me the $75, then Citibank refunded me the $75 as price rewind and then finally I got the $100 credit and free google home. Sprint's 3 month service cost me ~$200. So my final price on the phone has been $450(minus $100 Store credit and google home)  so basically $350 bucks haha and for $350 it's a good phone .
>The Accord Sport is more nicer to ride in 

Accord Sport is stiff. Low profile tires and a stiffer suspension setup. ILX has much softer ride and generally more comfortable.

Oh it is good BUT very spicy. I am a brown guy and I still find it pretty hot. 

>I should comment that my company will be reimbursing me for all commute expenses including the L

Shouldnt be hard then. Have you decided where you will be staying? Chicago has a lot of bad areas, stay away from them, stay near the L so you wont need a car.
>It’s in Chicago. I have found roommates.

Setup a budget. See how much you will take home, how much you will be spending. 

I live in Chicago. It's possible to make $3000/mo work. It will be tight.
Is it Chicago or the suburbs?

$39k in chicago is not hard but it's gonna be a bit tight. You will absolutely need a roommate. 
> Looking at a 3 year old car with 15,000 miles on it. It's a reliable car that I plan on keeping for at least 10 years. 

What car is this? 
No point in paying cash with a 750+ credit, he will qualify for a 2.49% loan. Can easily get more return on the money by investing it.
>I won't ever see that money for at least another 37 years unless I want a penalty. Also, there is risk involved if there is a market crash. Then I am screwed.

Over 37 years you are not going to get screwed.  There is next to no risk over 37 years.
>So did he bring back the black money? And if not 15 lakhs, how much are we going to get?

No one ever talked about you getting anything.  Stop with your bullshit.
Depends on where you are located.
>Tied for most F1 wdcs, current most poles, as well as a few other records, beating legends like Senna and Schumacher.

That has more to do with the most dominant car in f1 history that he has had the fortune of driving since 2014. Stats =/= technical prowess. Between 2014-2016, he had more wins,more poles, more podiums than first 6 years of his career. 

You can't use a driver's statistics to say he is "technically" the best. Nico tied with Lewis between 2014-2016 in dry races(28-28) excluding mechanical issues on both sides, does that make Nico "technically" as good as Lewis? 

Stats dont equal the how good a driver is "technically". It makes a driver more successful not technically better especially when those stats are in a constructor series like F1/LMP1 and not in a spec series like F2 or Indycar.

I am not saying Lewis is good or bad, I am saying you cant use stats to define a driver.
> Technically (like him or not) isn't the best driver in the world Lewis Hamilton?

How is "technically" Lewis the best driver? Genuine question.
>I am making about 300k/year 

Is that your revenue or your profit?
> I have a wife and 3 kids, so our friggin health insurance is stupid expensive.

Does your wife work? 

Get rid of that truck. You dont need a truck. You are a dentist, not a handyman.
>I'm guessing you don't really need a truck

A staggering amount people who own a truck dont need one tbh. I have doctors in my hospital who come to work in a truck while I wonder why the fuck does this guy even need a truck.
>My finances are just kind of intimidating because there is so much at play. Anyone have any general advice?

Cut down expenses. Save more. Apart from that there is no advice here.  A dentist doesnt need a truck. $750/mo that you spend on cars is probably over $1100 with insurance and gas. 

> I’m going to pay off our car loans,

That depends on your rate. If you car loan rates are 0-2.5/3%, there is no point in paying them off. Better to pay off the student loans because those rates are almost always higher.

You have made $160k in 6 months but you have just $14k saved which is not enough at all.

>health insurance is 2100


Get a cheaper plan. You are spending $25200/yr in health insurance. You are young, get a high deductible plan that is cheaper and save the money up in a HSA or a normal savings account. 
/r/churning
>Why would you not get a $35k Tesla?


The only Tesla for sale  at <$40k within 50 miless of chicago is a 4 year old Model S with 85000 miles on it.

Nationwide the inventory of a $35k Model S doesnt exist, the ones that cost in that range all have over 80k miless on them. 

By getting a car that is not known for it's reliability, retails for 80k-100k+ new and has 80k+miles on it, you are setting yourself up for disappointment, might as well burn that 35k up.


The only Luxury car you buy is one that you can afford new. If you cant afford a new Tesla, you shouldnt be buying one.

>I'm just extremely conservative on this stuff. I understand your math. But if I lose my job or ability to work tomorrow then I owe no one even one red cent.

Oh I get that that's what you keep the cash for. My point is save up the cash to buy a new car and once you can afford a car on cash THEN finance it so in an event you cant pay for it using your income, you still have that cash! 

So right now if something happened that rendered me unable to work, I still have the cash to pay it all off whenever I wanted to. 

That's all! But to each his own,yes.
>The better question is why take a loan at all? Your expenses are 3k on 10k net according to your other posts here. Take that 7k per month and save it 4 months then pay cash for the car. Or buy it now outright with your savings and pay yourself back with whatever terms you would have otherwise gotten with a loan?

>Why in the world go in debt if you don't have to?

Because OP will most likely qualify for the top tier of credit. By investing the cash he would use up buying the car, he would in almost all probability come out ahead at the end of 60 months even if he invests in a bond fund. By paying for cash you are throwing money away. I will give you my example, 

I have $150k in car loans, I have the cash to buy those cars on cash but I decided to invest it in VWELX. Over last 3 years, I have got 9% return.$37k in $$ value, it has already paid for my next car. If I had paid for all 3 of my cars on cash, I would have lost out on that $37k. 


> Just for some perspective, I think the average person your age making 160k is probably having the same debate but with a $100k tesla.
> 
> I make noticeably less than you, support a family of 5 and am probably going to buy my wife a used Tesla for 35k this year. And I have less than half your net worth. Yet I still feel relatively frugal.

I own a Tesla. Dont get a $35k Tesla. I get the attraction of one but yea the  way you would be able to get a Tesla in that price range is if it's Tesla with 70-80k+miles on it. LOL NO.
How much do you make right now? Buying a car on cash might be your only option.
You cant afford a car for $170/mo when you make $400. It's going to cost you insurance,gas,maintenance. 
> and cold, cold as fuck. no thank you.

So is a huge portion of USA. I mean we have cold for 5 or so months here in Chicago.
>Overall the Total Cost of Ownership comes out to $12,202.74. SO with 30532 miles, that makes a $.39/mi Total Cost of Ownership.

>So if you compare this data to /u/points4trying data you will see that we end up with a similar Total Cost of Ownership! Yay!

The difference is he drove a better car and this is exactly why I am of the opinion that cheaper cars are not always a better deal.

OP with an older car >110k miles has had similar TCO as someone who bought a brand new car.  

/u/points4trying also drove more miles, paid more interest and still ended up with same TCO as OP . Makes me think that if  /u/points4trying had a more reliable vehicle like a Honda and paid 0-1.9% interest, his TCO would have been even lower.


Kind of goes against this subs narrative of buying 5-7k cars.
>The Rav4 XLE comes with power trunk and roof rails.

RAV4 is also at the EOL for current generation. CR-V is all new. So it's a toss up for OP.
>I've thought about school a long time. It's not for me and it's not something I'll do. Despite the retardation of my post, I will never take out a loan. There's no job that I want to do that will involve a degree or any sort of study


So how do you ever plan on improving your life or evne think of being able to afford a BRZ? 

You need education, not having education makes you stagnant. You cant live the rest of your life making $15000 a year.
> I also won't be going to school because I can't afford it.

That's what loans are for. You go to school, you take students loans if you cant afford them, file for FAFSA and then when you start making money you pay them back. Not going to school is one of the worst decisions you can make for yourself.
> Damn how do you people make so much money...

We study our ass of in high school and college so we can live a comfortable life for the rest of our lives.
>What?

>Yeah I'm not making 100k this is a hypothetical. I'm asking why the hell you need to make doctors wage to afford a 30k vehicle??


Coz your hypothetical numbers are off. 

Someone making $100k takes home ~$60k after taxes. That is around $5k/mo. Then you have to pay rent/mortgage, you have student loans,loads of bills , savings and then you have insurance, you have to pay gas  money and before you know it , you are making $100k a year and  you are living paycheck to paycheck.

Also $100k is not doctor's wage. Source : I am a doctor.
Who is gonna pay taxes?
 

And you are not making $100k 

>Greater than 100k?? Holy hell why?

I am not sure how to answer that question. How do you reckon you can afford a car that expensive if you don't make enough money for it?
>Even if my car is slowly deteriorating?

If your car is deteriorating, get something that you can afford not a $30000 car you cant afford. You need to be making >$100k and have no debts to afford that car.
> Welcome to primary care. I work my ass off and get paid squat. I don't get a day off paid maternity leave either... But that's off topic.

It still shouldnt be this low. I know coz I work primary care and my gross is around $240k with 4 weeks of paid leave and very signficant health benefits! 

You need to look for a better job. You are being ripped off!!

>And no stubs because it's all direct deposit.

Doesnt matter. You still should get paystubs. Look into your employee portal. I get paid direct deposit too and my employee portal has pay stubs and everything. 

>I do think I'll contact payroll though. At least they should be able to show me how everything adds up, right?

Yup.
You dont  get pay stubs for the money you receive?

I know this is off topic but $150k without any major benefits is a very low pay for a physician. 

On topic unless you have significant pre-tax deducations, You might want to contact the payroll department. Something doesn't add up. Dont make a fuss though, just ask them for your pay statements and then see how it is.


>Thanks for this, I'll be looking into it!


Just saw you already have a credit in form of autoloan. Make an account on CreditKarma and post your score.
>Not if OP already has a credit score and accounts on the report, as OP stated he (or she) does.

Not sure how I missed it but yeaa.
> If you end up having to get a secured card it doesn't really matter where you get it from.

It does actually. Banks like Bofa often charge annual fee on their secured card.  Some companies like CapitalOne, give you more credit line than the $$ you put in. $300 might get you $500-600 worth of CL.
> All this time you spent arguing on Reddit could have been spent earning income.

I max out my 403b,457b,Backdoor roth IRA. That's >$40k in retirement accounts every year plus almost a $100k that I put in my mutual funds account and properties to generate rental income.

 I already make enough to retire when I am 40 and live the rest of my life off my investments without ever touching my contributions.

So yea, I am at the "I dont give a fuck about saving more than I already do" phase. 

But yeah good job comparing a electronic item with food. No one asked OP to sacrifice on food , you on the other hand, yup, good job.
No.
You have only one option for first credit card. It's called a secured credit card.

> Yeah, but at $10/1GB over, $80 for unlimited is a nice deal

You get unlimited high speed data on Cricket for $55/mo.  All cricket plans are unlimited anyway even the $35/mo one, it's just that  the speed decreases after 5gb but the $55/mo plan is truely unlimited @ high speed.

On MetroPCS (Tmobile's low price service) unlimited is @ $50/mo. 4 lines @ $100.

On Straighttalk unlimited is $54/mo and they use Verizon's network.


$80/unlimited isn't a good deal at all especially coz you can use the same network and pay $26/mo less + the taxes which are not included in Verizon prices.
>And personally I’d go with Verizon, but whatever carrier is available in OPs area would be ok.

TBH, Verizon or Verizon MVNO, the end user's experience is the same 9 out of 10 times. Straight Talk is a Verizon MVNO. You get access to Verizon's network and you get $35/mo, 2gb unlimited talk text or $44 and 10gb unlimited talk text.

Cricket which is owned by ATT gives 5GB data @ $35 with unlimited talk text.

MVNOs are the way to go for people looking for value!

>Depends on the interest rate on the car loan vs. the rate of return on a bond fund or a CD. If he can reliably beat the spread, your idea would work. But if he can't, then it isn't worth it.


I think that's implied. It wont work unless OP/anyone else trying it has top credit tier.
> I think spending $20k cash is fine.

Why spend cash when the credit is so cheap? You can invest that cash into a bond fund or even CD and you will still make money while having a loan. By paying cash, you losing out on free money.
>I guess relatively speaking. Is your Citi significantly lower than your AMEX?

Citi is the lowest limit on any of the cards I have @ $8800. For Amex I have the everyday card coz I needed to save the MR points when I cancelled my plat and they gave me a $11000 limit and then I asked for an increase and they made it $19000. I haven't asked since then coz I don't see the point. 
Citi Double Cash is a good card so Is the Amex  blue cash everyday. Personally AMEX has been good with credit limit for me.

High as in how high?
>And out of curiosity, what cars do you have?

A Model S, NX200t and An Accord. :)

>Very interesting. So, are you suggesting I should just buy it, or follow these guidelines if I did?

You can't buy the car you want though. At your income, you shouldn't be spending $20k on a car. You need to make 70-80k for that. Look into a '14+ Corolla/Camry or '13+ Civic but that means you won't get rates below 2%. But if you have top credit, getting 2.49% won't be a big ask.

>Being in any form of debt doesn't seem like a good thing to me, but you do have quite a solid argument.

The interest on debt matters.If it cost you $$ on that debt, than yeah it's bad. But if it's an interest free debt or if that debt is making you money to simply put it, then it's not a bad idea. You have the cash to pay off that debt whenever you want but it's just that you that cash to make you more money. 

I have seen CUs offer as low on 1.99% on used cars. If you can get anything below 3%, you should be good, invest the cash into a Cd if you are risk averse or just put it in a very conservative Vanguard fund that will get you 3-5% return like VASIX or if you don't wanna go that conservative, something like VWINX.  


>Finally, and most importantly, you are in a thread asking about IRA funding and resort to giving budgeting advice. I'll quit arguing when you get back on topic...

Lol. $100/mo at 8% over 30 years is like $140k before taxes, over 35 years it's over $200k. Enough to last OP 3-4 years when he retires.

My point still remains because here is what OP asked for,

>I want to invest as much as I can so I can become a millionaire and retire early. What's the best way to do this with vanguard? I'm not really sure how much to contribute.

So yeah, I am on topic. OP needs to cut that expense so over next 3 decades, by the time he retires, he will have that money swell up to a big number. 

Keep downvoting me all you want, I know what I am talking about.

>Right. And he could also only eat beans and rice and save another $100 per month...

Irrelevant and your argument is vague. So I am pretty sure you dont know how an Apple watch with cellular works and why it's a want vs need.OP could get a regular Apple Watch (without the capability to make phone calls) and change to Cricket by AT&T and he would save $100/mo without his quality of life changing at all. Living on rice and beans on other hand? LOL. I get that everyone has a right to his/her opinion, but stop arguing for the sake of arguing. 

>My point is, just arbitrarily saying something is too high because you wouldn't spend it is pointless.


My point is that you dont need a watch that can make phone calls when you have your smart phone in your pocket. If you want a smart watch, Apple has Apple Watch with the exact same features apart from the ability to make phone calls. That saves OP $1200/yr.  


>Things like “no one needs an Apple cellular plan watch” aren’t really good comments. Doesn’t help.

Well, it does because that wasn't the only thing I said. You implied $100 savings dont matter. I said it does because it's extra $1200 a year.
> Does the phone plan really matter? It's an extra $100 for OP if they switched to your plans. They are making 56 times that per month.
> 
> 

The problem here is not Apple Watch. OP has Series 3 Apple Watch with Cellular. No one needs a cellular watch when they have an iPhone. It's more of a want vs need. A non cellular Apple Watch would have same functions apart from the ability to use it as a phone.

>It's an extra $100 for OP if they switched to your plans. They are making 56 times that per month.

And it's extra $1200 a year. That's enough money for OP for 6 months worth of insurance.  A $ saved is a $ earned. Regardless how much you make. I am a physician but even then for me$100/mo savings while not substantial is still savings.
>Apple watch? Doesn't your phone give the time? Sorry, but that's a lot of money for a watch.


He has a series 3 Apple Watch which has Cellular. It's unnecessary regardless. 

>I think I'm at like $35 a month with Cricket, w/ unlimited texts and more data than I use.

Cricket is really good. I agree.
> So you think a five year loan would be best?

Yes.

> Investing that money is an interesting approach I hadn't thought of

I have ~$150k worth of cars. All of them were bought on 0-2.49% loans. I could have bought them on cash. Over last 3 years that 150k has performed at ~9% in a balanced fund. Had I done what everyone here does, I wouldn't have had extra ~37k that I have now righ now. It will automatically pay for my next car. Now I am not saying you will get 9% return over next 5 years but 3-5% is not a bad expectation.

> I'm just not sure how I'd feel about the obligation of constantly making monthly payments for five years? 

You put it on autopay via your bank's bill pay service for $xxx for next 60 months and forget about it.

> I've always bought my cars cash, so it's never something I've dealt with.

You leave money on the table by doing that. Remember, even a CD gets you 2.6% over five years . New car loans can be easily had for 0-1.99% from manufacturer deals, that's free money.
I don’t know man, it felt incomplete .
Credit unions offer 2-2.5% if the dealer doesn’t.  What car is this? 

All manufacturers have special financing rates, it’s all year round for non luxury cars. Once in a while for luxury cars, even my Tesla is financed at that rate . 

I am not sure why you opted for a 40 year mortgage but uhmm.. it might be a good to throw some money at it.
>Because that doesn't make sense to me and sounds like a common misconception. Please clarify if I'm mistaken: Are you describing it as a checking account because you're running all your bills through the card, or are you actually depositing $10k+ to the credit card and keeping the balance highly positive?


It's basically overpaying your credit card account. Your limit is $5000, one day you go crazy and pay the card for $10000, now you have a positive of $10000+ a credit limit of $5000. It's very frowned upon by banks and if OP is saying he needs to do $10k-$100k worth of this multiple times, it is more or less something less than legal.
I would have thought of the same thing and said the same thing, can you tell I am a "fuckin FOB".
> I've also seen a crazy obsession with American Eagle and Aeropostale Polos 

FWIW, AEO and Aeropostale are not in the same league. Aeropostale is like the shittiest crap ever, AEO not so much and costs 2-3x too.
I was given a decent chunk of money by grandparents once I finished my education so I can kinda tell you what to do,

$1.3mi @ 4% draw rate would get you $52k/yr for the rest of your life  without touching the 1.3mil. The key is to get a portfolio that lets you do that.

Dont tell anyone about this. It's best to keep it a secret.

Live below your means. Don't go ahead and splurge on a $50k car and big ass house you dont need.


Remember, banks and credit unions only insure you upto $250k via FDIC/NCUA. 

So the best course of action is to park the money in multiple accounts in multiple banks,preferably the ones that earn you any kind of interest while you figure out what to do. 

My choice would be the money spread out over 6 HY savings/MMA accounts. Then you can decide what you want to do with it.

You can also invest your money into education as you mentioned and its the best thing to do. Not everyone gets the chance you have!

Apart from that the usual, 6-9 months of emergency fund and all that applies.

Just edited my post coz of a huge typo. But yea, see what funds your current employer has to offer. I would just roll it into a Vanguard IRA and then put it all in a target date fund.

>We are currently saving to buy a new car with cash later this year. (I know PF is not generally a fan of this idea. Its a combination of want and need.) That should be fully funded this summer.

Dont pay with cash if your credit score is in the top tier. Top tier credit on autoloans is 0-2% on new cars. It makes no sense to pay cash, even if you invest that cash in CD over 5 years and you will get more return, even more if you put it in a conservative fund, that's free money you are  throwing away because you are listening to this sub's advice which is tailored towards people with shitty credit.


> The next goal is getting to 20% on our existing mortgage so we can ReFi with no PMI and a potentially better interest rate.

What's your rate right now? How much do you pay in interest every month? Your next step should depend on that but because it's 4 years, dumping a big chunk of the money in the mortgage might be a good bet.


>For the old 401k, I am not sure what would be the best route: rolling it over to my current employer's 401k or rolling it over into a Roth IRA (probably with Vanguard). I expect my tax rate will be higher when I retire than it is now, so I know a Roth is the suggested IRA in that situation.

It's tax rate AFTER you retire. So basically, you are saying  your retirement income will be more than 84k?  If yes, than it might make sense.
  
Unless you are sure you will make more than $84k when you retire, rolling over in a traditional IRA is your only income. I am not sure if you can roll over old 401k into your current 401k.

The only way you can remotely afford this is if you rent a room in the house to a roommate but despite that this is too much house for that income. 

At 65k with no other debt, most I would spend is $150k  and 20% is the minimum I would be comfortable with. PMI is a bitch.

DOnt touch it. When I finished my residency, I kept my Roth account as it was. Remember you can still do a backdoor Roth.

Your income would be too much for a tradition IRA deduction too. Keep the Roth, max out the 401k/403b that you will get from your work.

> So why would you even suggest that?

> 

I didnt. You said 9.94%, I said financing a car loan makes sense if you qualify for the top tier of credit or it doesnt and you asked me where to get it and I replied. I never said look for 0-3%, I said it makes sense only if you qualify for top tier.
>Just wanted to make sure, otherwise I would be caught under that :)


Haha! Yeah, if you are above $10k, you will be under FBAR, for FATCA, It was $100k last year IIRC. I have to file FATCA every year, it's a pain in the ass. 
>Where are these magical 3% interest loans and how do I apply?

Most people with 720-740+ credit will qualify for a new car loan at 0-1.9% depending on your manufacturer and CPO car loans from manufacturer at 0.99%+ and used car loans at 2.49% or more. 

My Tesla is financed at 0.99%, CPO Lexus at 1.9% and Honda at 0.9%. 

With a less than ideal credit, those rates are a dream.


>Do you have any dissenting feelings about a 60mo loan for $13000 at 9.97apr? Haven't been able to secure anything better.


You should never finance a car unless you rate is ~3% or less.
> BTW I cannot figure out how to do even a simple operation like changing oil without an elevator.

You dont need anything to change cabin and engine filters and the wipers. Those are like the most basic DIYs and saves you loads of $$.

>I know this sub hates "luxury" cars and think they are money pits but I need it for work.

I dont understand. 


As someone who owns luxury cars, I would never keep them once they are out of warranty.

>My main questions if anyone have any advice is how much DIY maintenance can save?

From my experience on changing filters(cabin and engine) on Lexus and Mercedes, It saves me over $120-130. Mercedes stealership charges $150 to change the cabin filter, costs me $20 to buy from amazon. Same goes for wipers and engine filters.

I am not into changing oil myself BUT if you can go ahead with that, it would save you 70-80%. 
> Bills are 160-170 a month for cable, 57$ phone.

That's too much money for cable. I pay $40 to comcast for internet, $15 for 4k netflix, $5 (via my sister's student account) for  Hulu+Spotify. 

But yeah you are spending a bit too much on lunch. Take lunch from home.
>Income of $35k/yr, driving a $20k car is not a good investment

Even with a $500k  income, any car is not a good "investment". Car is never ever an investment. It's a depreciating asset.  

>If you made at least $50k/yr, then I think it's okay if you bought a $20k car in cash.

Credit is too cheap nowadays, you are throwing money away by paying cash if your credit is good. Car loans are 0-3% these days. You will always make more than that investing that cash over 5 years. 
FATCA states ~~$5k~~$50k or more if you live in united states.

FINCEN says FBAR for $10k or more.  

So I guess you should be exempt.

>big incident

Tell that to the parents of the kid who died. 
Two more things,

go to 

https://www.kbb.com/

Go there and tell us what the value of the car is.

See if you can move into a smaller place for a year or so. How big is your current home? 

Are your kids in college? Can they take care of the toddler?


What are the loan repayments for?

Do you have credit card debt?

How much back taxes do you have?
Get the kids to work too. Whatever extra they can bring in, helps you. Or sign up for Uber and drive till you get the extra money to get out of the mess.
>My rent is so high because I live in Denver. The 1200 food is actually all household items and expenses not listed. I have 5 phones on my plan. I have 4 kids total 22, 19, 18 and 4 I will try to fins a way to dial back

What do the adult kids do?  Can they find a part time job? Even with 4 kids, food should not be $1200. At the most with home cooking it would be $500.


> I have 5 phones on my plan.

I pay $100 for 5 lines. You need to look into /r/nocontract .


>The V6 Accords do not.

Yeah but they dont make V6 Accords anymore but the new 2.0 comes with 10 speed transmission.

THe point was those most (not all) Hondas have CVTs.
> You should make sure the car you're buying doesn't have a CVT if avoidable... 

All new-ish Hondas have CVT.
Do you have a roommate? 

From my experience, living alone in a 1bd is always more expensive than living with someone in a 2bd apartment.

>Any suggestions on how to build my business or try to make extra money on the side? Or how to budget what little money I have? Possibly in the food area since that seems to be the most flexible to me?

Meal prep is something you could do. 

If you have a decent car, you can try driving for weekends on your free days. 

Maybe find another job part time.


Procrastination.
>Well, I know this sounds extremely teenage of me but I'm a really big fan of strong and powerful cars. Something with speed to it.

Yeah but all that is alright when you make decent money. Buying a V6 Accord that has a 100k miles on it and costs over 10k is not a sane financial decision.


>personally I wouldn't spend 100k on a car regardless of my salary. Personal preference.

Neither would I anymore haha!
>Average is like $2400 a month

Why not get a lower mileage car? Why buy a 100k mile+ V6 which might need timing belt change when you can get a 2014 or so Civic with half as much miles for almost that price?


>Credit karma says 735


How much do you make?
> progressive is pretty good and you can do it online.

it depends. Progressive gave me 2x the quote I pay right now to Nationwide.

I am kinda sure that's MissSerena on pornhub. She deleted her account though and I have been looking for 3 videos she ever uploaded.
Here is the thing, 

She makes enough money to not be in this kind of a mess. Even if she lives in New York City, $70k is usually enough. I was a single guy making $55k in Brooklyn during my residency years and I still saved money. 


The first thing she needs to do is tell us why she is spending SO MUCH money. 

Second thing is to sit down and see how much that car is worth.  See what she would need to do to get rid of it. Depending on how big that number is,she will have to choose what needs to be done. Her only option might be to keep using the car till she starts building decent savings and has enough money to get rid of the car AND replace it with something cheaper while cutting other expenses which are,

and $1200 on food, $300 on cellphones, $2000 on rent, $300 on utilities, is a LOT of money for 2 people one of who is a kid. 

She needs to move into a smaller apartment,  Food for 2 people should not be more than $300-350 a month. Cellphones cost $40/mo on MetroPCS which is owned by TMO and Cricket which is ATT's prepaid service. That's almost $1000-1100 in savings/mo, not including how much a smaller apartment would save her.

By cutting these expenses, she will have enough surplus per month to start building some decent savings.


At the end of the day it's about crunching numbers and if dipping into her retirement is what is "cheaper" at the end of the day to get out of mess. 
> Do people who fall into debt have lots of unnecessary purchases, emergencies, or just unorganized spending habits?

It can be all of them.
But it is almost always a result of unorganized spending habits. People spend too much money, dont save enough and then when they have an emergency, they have no savings.

A 6 month emergency fund would almost always negate most emergencies.
687 And 14% doesnt just seem right. I have seem people with that score usually get rates below 5%.

Call USAA again , tell them you want to REFINANCE your loan, I dont see a reason why they wold say no.

Why has her score dropped? Credit karma would tell her whats affecting her scores.

You will need to find someone to take over your lease or take it back to the dealership but that would be expensive.

>I am not opposed to driving a beater until my credit situation approves. Not thrilled but you do what you gotta. Any suggestions would be most appreciated.

TBH, that's your only option.

> I wish I could just get the car through Nissan directly, but that's another conversation altogether.

Thats how i got my Tesla hahaa!

>That's what I've been doing, nobody wants to give me any numbers haha. I can email a few more dealers as I live within a close proximity to a big metro area. 

Yup I live in Chicago suburbs and thats what I do.

>  think Costco also has an option to get a car through them somehow.

Yup and its a good service. 

>I'll look into these but still that does not solve my initial problem - how can I minimize the chances of me getting the best deal even before walking into a dealer?


You email all dealers within 50 miles. You tell them you intend to buy the car within 7-10 days (or whatever your time frame is). Tell them you dont intend to come in without knowing you are getting a decent deal. Tell them you want to keep the communication over the email so there is a record of what was discussed. 

Also go on sites like edmunds and other forums to see what people are paying for their cars. See the invoice price and make sure you dont pay over that unless the car has a markup. Some cars go for as much at 10-15% off on MSRP.

> What would you recommend within $35-$40k budget, which Lexus specifically?

Both Lexus IS and ES are very good cars. My suggestion is to go the CPO route on Lexus because of how good their warranty is. I just picked up a CPO NX200t and it comes with 2 years of prepaid maintenance and a 6 year UNLIMITED mile warranty.

http://www.lexus.com/lcertified/certification-warranty#warranty

Another good car as I already mentioned is the 2018 Accord EX-L or above. It will have more features than any entry level full size sedan or luxury car you buy.   As someone who is into cars and loves cars and has expensive cars, 2018 Accord has pleasantly surprised me so much so that I am genuinely thinking of getting one. 


Edit : I like Maxima too, I had one as a rental in California. It's fast and nimble but I dont know about owing one for 10 years. I am not a big fan of owning "luxury" cars for 10 years. Problems start arising when they are out of warranty and tbh Lexus and maybe Acura are the only ones I would buy for long term.
From what I know about Kia/Hyundai, they typically have huge savings off MSRP which you are provided an option of vs 0% APR, in such cases, it's better to sit down crunch some numbers  and see if the savings is big enough to warrant going through a CU/Bank coz despite having higher rates , it might be cheaper for you to go via that route because of higher discount off MSRP.


Having said that, Kia Cadenza depreciates VERY quickly and long term reliability is a big big question mark.


 If you want a nicer car that you plan on using for 10 years, a Lexus is a much better option or the 10th gen Accord is a very very nice car, I just test drove it and I was kinda surprised at how good it felt w.r.t to bells and whistles and general build quality. I highly recommend you take a look at it once, the loaded Accord EX-L will have just as many things (Even more tbh) as an entry level Cadenza and the touring has many more features.
You are spending wayy too much money for your income.

Why is your rent so high? 

Why are you spending $952/mo driving a car you can't afford?

Why are you spending $1200/mo on food?


You need to get rid of that car. 

You need to move out of that rentaal you are in and look for something cheap.

You need to stop spending $40/day on food.

Why are you spending $300/mo on phone?


You are living a lifestyle someone making 2 times the money you do can afford. You need to seriously dial back.
What do you plan on replacing it with?
I am a doctor. Loss of employment is not a factor for me. I also have enough to pay off my mortgage if I need to. I save over $130-140k a year right now and only debts I have are my 0-1.99% car loans and mortgage which is 2.75%. Pretty sure I have all my bases covered.

Cash for that debt had performed very well over all my investments. Works for me.
CD is a no risk investment, so would be something like an I-bond.
Even CDs give you 2.6% over 5 years. Most new car loans are 0-1.99% for top credit tier. Even CPO loans are 1.99% with BMW and a few other luxury companies. The point is not financing an auto loan when you have very good credit is basically leaving money on table. Even a conservative bond heavy fund would perform more than that. 

Or I can invest $100k towards a downpayment in a money generating investment like a rental property or a gas station .

Buying any car on cash is a bad idea when you qualify for that low of an interest rate coz even a CD will net you more money


As someone who makes enough and has a $100k car. Why would I pay $100k in cash when I qualify for a 0-2.99% auto loan? Over 5 years , I know I will be able to get a better return if I invest that much money. 

Paying that much money in cash and not investing it is throwing money away.
> I thought about this also. The only credit card debt we have is $741 total. I figured it out this morning, and if we pay $175/month,

If you can afford to pay it off even faster, do that. Remember, it's sure shot ~20-25% return because you save that much on interest.
I dont see this being a very good decision.

You are also spending wayy too much money on your vehicle.

$726 on a $3400 take home pay is over 21%. 


If you do decide to go ahead with this, make sure you have a proper prenup and a proper legally binding agreement in case things go south in future.

Rent together first though.
You dont have debts.  You can go ahead and then "rent" it to your dad.  Also he is on disability so that should be a factor in your decision too.

There might be tax implications, so you might wanna look into it. A way to get around that might be to have your dad "gift" you $$.  But that might be a bad advice on my part.
This seems more of a /r/relationship question.

If you are okay with him not paying you once in a while, why not?
>It's not a specific amount, just as much as possible to survive off for the next 1-2 months.

No emergency fund?

No family or friends you can borrow from? 

You can pay for most things using a credit card. You dont really need cash.
>Can I get a cash advance from my bank's ATM?

Using your credit card? How much cash do you need exactly? Why not apply for a personal loan. Cash advance is loan shark level bullshit tbh.
>I know, but is there a way to turn it into cash?

You do realize cash advance or any credit card debt is very high interest? 20-25%. You paying $200-250 in interest for every $1000 you take from them.
>Why would someone in their 20s need to be putting away $24k per year towards retirement, before considering things such as saving for a house or regular investing in the stock market (index funds)?

$24k/yr right now is much much more 40 years later.  Compound returns is a huge thing.

It's better to maximize your earnings right now.


But at the end of the day, it's about your priorities. Not everyone can save that much anyway.
>I have a few credit cards, but how do I turn my credit limit into cash in my hand? How hard would it be to get a loan approved? Does the lender need a reason/proof as to what the loan is for?


That's not what a credit card is for.
Sapphire Reserve is a better card tbh. 

Also the 50000 points is worth more than $625.

/r/churning is a better place for this.

Make sure she knows that right now , looking for a job is her full time job. Meanwhile if she can get a part time job somewhere, it would be good for both of you.

Once you have 6-7 months of expenses saved, start putting money into retirement accounts and saving up for downpayment while tackling the highest interest debts.

Make sure you dont buy too much house for your salary. Personallly @ $10k gross, I wouldn't spend more than $1800-2000 with taxes,insurance and mortgage.
>Is leasing not a viable option?


I forgot to mention this but leasing is basically impossible for someone with shitty/no credit. 
>I don't think it makes a difference but she isn't planning on applying for a green card until later this year.

Why not apply for Green Card asap? It's a slow process and takes time and the earlier you get, better.

I am pretty sure that she wont qualify for any program without being a LPR or US Citizen.
You need an emergency fund of $18000($3000x6 months) and you far too off that. Put the emergency fund in a discover savings account which will give you 1.4% OR Ally which is 1.35% or Marcus by GS which is 1.5%

You spend almost $3000 a month and a car payment payment of $330 + insurance wihch I assume is another $100 and from what I am seeing, there is no way to decrease those expenses.

Wire transfers typically have beat exchange rates. 

Your other option is a DD/Certified check.

India has strict rules on how and why you can send money from India to any other country. So there are not many options. 
Look on the back of your card, you will see where you can check balance. Go to that site , register the card and it should show.
You should ofcourse talk to banks/CUs too . Sometimes you might get lucky. Never leave a $ on the table.
>And I wouldn't shop around financing at the dealers. 

Why? I have bought 4 cars in last 5 years. I have always had dealers offer me a better rate than CU/banks. For people with good credit, it doesnt matter. Dealers have affiliation with banks/car manufacturers/CUs and usually offer you the best rate you will get unless its a "buy here,pay here" lot.
Look into chase slate card. 

0% on balance transfers and $0 transfer fee. 

If you can't get approved for that, look into any other balance transfer card.
>Is leasing not a viable option?


Leasing  means basically paying only for depreciation. Irrespective of leasing or buying, at that income no. 

You basically can afford a $10k car AT the most. But that's where you should draw the line.
You can’t afford a $20k car if you are making approx $30k a year, regardless of your lifestyle.
> Well, yeah, obviously we have to call Chrysler Capital. I thought waiting 10 more days so i can call and say "hey, I fucked up but I can make a $1,500 payment right now" would be better and calling and saying "hey I fucked up and also I'm broke".

Oh I was not confused, I was just pointing out that it's kinda weird that nowadays Hondas are more American than something like a ford which is basically more european than American.

"American made car" is kinda weird as in Hondas are made in USA/Mexico too. It's just that the engineering on the "Japanese" cars is much better than the "American cars"

I can't speak for that because my income when I received the money was high, so i never qualified for that but you can google it up a bit.
From the last time I was in this situation,

1)You can receive $100k from foreign country WITHOUT having to declare it to IRS.

2)Above $100k-$5.6mil you need to let IRS know but not pay tax on it.

3)Above $5.6mil you have to pay tax.
This is a /r/relationship post as much as it is a /r/pf post.

What's rate on the car loan? It might help to put it all in as fast as you can. Check your insurance documents and talk to your agents about gap coverage.

Another thing, stay away from Chryslers/Jeeps in future. They are unreliable, they depreciate VERY quickly.
>I’ve also heard that money that goes to these retirement is essentially put in stocks; how is this not safe?

Funds.

And over long term , it is safe. There is no risk over 20-30-40 years.  Stock/funds are long term investments. In short term it is essentially gambling.

> Debit cards offer purchase protection

No they dont. Cite your source. They offer "fraud" protection(Which is not a benefit at all), there is NOT ONE debit card in the industry that offers purchase protection.

> Debit cards are basically credit cards that limit you to only money you have. 

That's not how it is "technically".  In practice yes but not really.

>They are even issued by credit card companies, who are the ones that offer the purchase protection for them.

Nopes. Purchase protection is smoething no debit card has ever offered.


You are grossly misinformed. 
>Never heard of a company buying out sick days. It's a use it or lose it thing


That depends on company policy. I had 60 days of leave accumulated when I left my last job, just before I left my job, they cashed out everyone's PTO bank because of a change in PTO policy and we had an option to cashout every year any time @ 90% or 100% during a fixed time which used to be a few days in APril and November.
You score is fine. 
>Everyone starts paying off the full amount every time, but then something always happens where the cc is the easy way out, and next thing you know there is a bunch of cc debt. Cut it up and get a simple debit card.

That's a bad bad advice. I have been using CCs since I was 16, I have over a decade of 100% payments and 0 interest.

Using a debit card is a bad idea. Your bank account is compromised if there is a data breach.

Credit card also has purchase protection, price protection, cashbacks, extended warranty , no debit card would offer those things (apart from cashbacks whih are no where as good as CCs).
>You might consider buying a recent but high mileage used car from one of the big car rental companies.

NO. Jeez. Rental cars are the most abused cars. I would stay away. Late model high mileage cars are a bad idea too.

You need to. You are making $7500 a month before taxes and you still dont have an emergency fund or substantial savings. Someone in your position should be able to save alteast 30k a year (more tbh).
>450 a month for a used car is not good.


That depends on what car it is.
Do one thing,

Edit the post and write down every dollar you spend. See what you are left with and then we can proceed.


You are spending money somewhere because 90k/yr is 7500/mo before taxes and even with $1000/mo mortgage, it's still a LOT of money for most Americans and 25 years of $40k student loan is just crazy. Even at $10k/yr, that's like 4 years worth. Start tackling that asap coz over 25 years you are gonna end up paying a lot of money.
>I have 10k to invest and I am not sure of my best option. Here is the relevant info:



>No rainy day fund to speak of, unless I count the stock I have built up from the above comment, which is sort of how I look at that tbh. I do have about 3k in my savings actually, so that is a bit extra I guess. I also put about 175 per month in my savings, so it is growing. Due to this, I have not considered just making this a rainy day fund, but I am open to the suggestion.


You need 6 months of expenses saved up. What if you lose your job tomorrow?

Put that $10k towards emergency fund and build it up to 6 months.



With $90k/yr, those student loans should be done within 4-5 years in worst case scenario.
> It depends on what we're doing... but a bad week is 600 dollars a week from what I'm told.

Here in Alabama (at least) thats pretty good, especilally when our health care and secondary health care is paid for by them and not us and it covers my pretty yellows too.

So a bad month is $2400/mo, that's not bad.

My grandmother still works because theyre trying to save some more before they move to Atlanta and they are trying to fix the house up nice enough to sell it. I can go on about them but I'm not gonna because the point is that they won't even take me to work even though they could. But they won't. My grandmother can't and my grandad used to drive me to work and he complained about it when it was only 15 minutes away. He won't drive me 100 miles away.

Here is the problem, you have an old Audi. Now I know it's an Audi but they are not reliable in long term, no german car is. When you do decide to get another car, get a Toyota/Honda. They are solid reliable car and maintenance is cheap.



Once you start making $$, make sure you open a savings account and put away money in it,atleast 6 months worth of expense, so you dont  have to be in such a position again.

How much will this new job pay you? 

You are in a tight space but if you guys can somehow fall back on family to help you guys and loan you 2-3k than that will get you a decent car and hence the job.

Which one is yours?


Shopping around helps. What's good for someone else might not be best for you. 

You wont get the best rate @ 688 though. You can get a decent credit card though at that score if you dont have one, pay it off on time every month and that should help your score.

Depends, if you are in for the long game, over 30 years, you are certain to make over 3.75%. 


Paying off the mortgage makes sense for people paying over 5% but I won't do it for 3.75%.
>I just started working full time about a month ago. I’ll definitely bump that up. Thank you for the advice!!


Makes sense. I would Advice a $10k car if you have a decent credit but you need an emergency fund too.  

Again avoid Chrysler/Jeeps, they are unreliable and in the long run it will end up costing you a lot more than a reliable Honda.

>The $30 k includes the car, and health debt, and credit card debt. Plus some miscellaneous things like a payment plan for a replacement water heater.

>Sorry I wasn’t clear about that - currently borrowing the Chrysler until the end of January.

You didnt give us a full picture of your finances.

What are your savings? 

Debts?

As I said, avoid Chrysler/Jeeps. Those things break often and are unreliable. You can't afford the Jeep anyway @ 28k. You dont make enough for that. Your best bet is a 2014+ Corolla or 2013+ Accord or a 2013+ Civic.  Reliable, cheap.
>Right now he just does data entry I believe but also does some other projects for the company that involve his knowledge of computer programing (He has a bachelor's in Computer Science).

Someone with a Bachelor in CS should be able to find a job easily if he  is good at it. 

Tell him to continue his job, start spamming applications on indeed, he should have a new job by within 3-4 weeks at most and then once he  accepts the offer, he can give his 2 week's notice.

>This leaves me with a surplus of $864 that I could put towards a vehicle. I have 3 options for buying a new (to me) car that I need to have to commute in. I can purchase my parent's 2015 Chrysler for $15k (about 3k less than KBB value with higher miles), their Jeep Grand Cherokee for $28k (about $8,000 less than KBB value), or look for a car from CL or a dealership. I commute between 3 and 4 hours for work every day, and having a comfortable car is a big plus to me, which is why I'm leaning towards purchasing one from my parents that's in good shape and I can get a good deal on.


Rule of thumb, never buy a Jeep/Chrysler. They suck.

Another thing, you don't need another car. You already have a car that you are paying $200/mo for, so why do you want another car?

You are planning to move to a high COL area, you need to bump your savings substantially.


>$50k, work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. I’m open to additional work, but have minimal time in which to do it.

Are you salaried? What field do you work in?


A more itemized budget with line breaks needs to be posted. 

Your debts are substantial for someone making 50k. You need to make 3 times the money you do to afford that car with your current financial state.
1)Get a secured credit card.

2)Get a savings account with Discover/Ally/Synchrony/Marcus.

3)You can get a checking account with them too.

4)IRA can be opened at Vanguard/Charles Schwab and your age means you can be very aggressive with investments.
When you quit a job, your health coverage ends that day so when you don't re-enroll, you miss out on whatever you can get and then if you dont quit the job, you end up like your SO has. 

And then there is COBRA which can be very helpful in emergencies but he wont get that either. 

Depending on what state you guys are in, check out Medicaid and if you guys have expanded medicaid. 

Medicaid might not cover mental health depending on the state so that would suck too.

There are organizations out there that help low income individuals with mental health issues.

What field does he work in? Is it a high demand field?

But how much do you make right now? How many hours? Can you get another job?
> When he was originally going to quit he opted out of re-enrolling because he didn't want to continue paying for the health insurance since he was leaving (I believe). 

That makes no sense. Even if someone plans to leave, doesn't mean that they don't re-enroll. You can be enrolled in the healthplan till the day you quit, that's the only way to get a continued coverage (And be eligible for COBRA). 

>But when they offered to pay him more and make sure he got his health insurance back, well he agreed to stay.

He heard it wrong. There is no way to get health insurance back without a major life event, not quitting a job is not one of those.


This should be a lesson for your SO tbh.
> Any dealers offering no money down leases? 

Uhh. You can't lease a car with no credit.  No one is going to lease any car for $100/mo with no $$ down. Lease deals are usually for highest credit tier. Someone with no credit will never be leased a car. 
how much cash you got?
Why do rates on credit card matter? Pay balance on time, fuck the rates.
>A Honda ain't flexing though.

Well as a doctor, atleast the people I work with, showing off is not a big deal as much as who has more patients. A surgeon who performs 5 surgeries a day driving a Honda will be flexing more than 2/day driving a S-class.  

Also doctors never drive a $7000 BMW. That's like a week worth of work for a fairly successful doctor. 


>>That's 5225 in fixed expenses each month or 62,700 per year, not including gassing up my car, eating, maintaining my house or vehicles, any medical spending, clothes, etc. There is no way someone making 70k could handle this expense load.

Your numbers would never apply to someone making $70k and here is why,

> Housing (Mortgage + Property Tax): 3900/month, 46800/yr
> 
> 

People making 70k don't have mortgages that are 3900/mo ANYWHERE in the country, NO Bank will finance a household with 70k a mortgage that costs $3900/yr. I make 25k/mo and my mortgage is still not 3900/mo and I live in a fairly high COL area. The least income you need to be even considered to be approved for $3900/mo mortgage is $10k/mo with no other debts because of something called DTI ie Debt to Income ratio and even that point it would be a subprime loan in a way.

>Auto Payment: 500/mo


Same. Households with 70k income dont drive cars that cost $500/mo. As I said Banks/Lenders have debt to income ratio. Your numbers are wayyy above that and kinda redundant in the discussion. 

>Phone (me + some family members): 250/mo


/r/nocontract has plans for $100/4 lines or even $100/5 lines on companies OWNED by Tmobile and ATT. 


--------

My point is people who make $70k don't get approved for mortgages that are almost $4000 a month with taxes and have autopayments of $600+ with insurance. That's >85% DTI and it will never happen in real world. Banks would run away from you the moment you hit 40% or so and you giving those numbers to make a point is kinda useless because of the reasons above.


$70k is more than enough for majority of Americans. There are a handful places in America where $70k won't be enough.

I was just going to comment this. OP can't afford it but just like every other 20 something year old  who makes a post about getting a car he can't afford, he is not going to listen to us.
>Would Computer Science be able to pay itself off in 5 years?


If you are good at it, it will pay off before that. CS is one of the best paying fields right now and I think it would remain that way for a long time in the future.
>If you can get that interest rate and keep up the payments then getting a car loan makes sense. 

I think I already implied that. :|

> But too many people buy a car they can't afford and 2 years into their 5 year loan suddenly can't make the payments. It's because they based the car they could afford on a monthly payment--forgetting about insurance, maintenance and changes in income/job.

That's true but my advice applies to someone who is financially stable and knows what they are doing.

>And most of them don't have the cash in the first place to put into a CD.

Again as I said, the advice is not for your usual 5k cash buyer. A lot of times I see people here on this sub saying "Never finance your car" and that is oversimplification to be honest. I have seen people suggesting "Buy your car with cash only" to someone making 6 figures and it's a bad advice because if you have 20-30k in cash and excellent credit, you will almost always come out ahead by financing the car instead of paying cash which imho is basically throwing money away. 
>  Hondas never really did anything for me personally (OK, I have a slight soft spot for the 2nd gen Legend) but they make absolutely fantastic engines.

Not that you are wrong BUT uhmm..  /r/formula1 would like to have a word with you
>Once they are paid off, should I keep at least one or cut them all?

That depends. Are you responsible enough to make sure you never be in debt again? Then you dont need to cut them up. If you are going to get into debt again, then yeah take your scissors and stop using the credit cards.
>Food, insurance, phone bill, gas and credit cards. The only thing I don’t pay for is rent.

Still that shouldn't be $2500. Food+insurance+phone+gas = $750-1000 at the MOST. Where is rest of your money going. Even if you are spending $1000 on those things, you still have $1000 or so left. Two months and your CC debt should be done.
>The debt is from making dumb decisions and being reckless and a teenager I guess (festivals, concerts, etc..) KBB is about $3500-$4000. And I work 45 hours a week. Thanks for the advice!

So you live at home, make like $2500/mo but you haven't paid down your credit card? 

Where is all your money going? With your income, it shouldn't take more than 2 months to pay off that debt.
>As an aside, do not finance a new car.

I never get this rationale. I have $30000 in cash. I qualify for 0-2% APR on a new for 5  years, why on earth would I pay $30k in cash if I can put that $30k somewhere where I am for sure getting more than 2-3% return. A CD would give you >2.5% over 5 years. By financing a car at 2% and putting at cash @ 2.5% , you are getting a free car loan + 0.5%/yr . This is the most conservative estimate. A conservative bond fund would get you like 3-4%+.
>Why do you suggest not having CCs and building a credit score while you are young?

It's more of a precautionary measure for someone like you who is already in debt to stop increasing that debt. There is nothing wrong in having a credit card, if you dont misuse it (Which you have). So by cutting up that card, you are preventing further debt.


Dont beat yourself up over it!

My advice is to pay off your debt first and then think of a car.

>The car is at 185000 miles right now.

The article says upto 125k miles or 8 years. Usually it is whichever is earlier, you might be SOL here. But doesn't hurt to ask, you dont have anything to lose.

As someone who has a bit of spending "problem" with impulse buy(my last one was a model S lol), I know how it is.  

At the end of the day, its all about self control. What I have done is to stop looking at shit online and stop going on sites such as slickdeals and it helps. Those small small purchases often add up.
Good job on realizing that it is a bad thing.

First step is acknowledgement!
You can try.
> One thing to add: Don't tell ANYBODY how much money you're making!!! Not Mom, not Dad, not anyone. When others know you make that kind of money, they'll treat you differently.

> Honestly though hitting $200-300k a year in software engineering is probably just as 'easy', and you can start doing it at 25 vs 35.

As someone who knows a LOT of software engineers, very few of them make $200k-300k a year. 
>Agreed. If you absolutely have to flex just buy a $7500 3-series and do a PPI on it so you can get something semi-reliable and keep up with the Joneses. Better than sinking a huge commitment into a new German car like so many doctors do, and looks nicer than a Civic.


A $7500 3 series would suck tbh. When I became an attending, I treated myself with a new Accord EX-L. It has everything you would need including leather heated seats, a decent sound systen, adaptive cruise control, collision mitigation and all that shit. I still use it (it's kinda new anyway lol).
>I need some advice and tips on how I can control my spending and start saving again

Dont buy stuff online. Simple as that. If you are having problems with that, cut up your cards and budget every month, put cash in envelope for the things you need.

Agreed. Making the money work for you is something this sub overlooks very often. Even a CD will give you >2.5% over 5 years, you are throwing away cash if you buy a $25000 car on cash. 
>Also regarding the anxiety - my wife is handling all the bills from now on

> I am a complete moron and will do anything to avoid paying bills because of the anxiety it gives me.

Why don't people put autopay? You are going to get a not so ideal rate at that credit score but rates are rising and what might be a sub-prime rate right now might be a very good rate few months in the future.

It depends. Dermatologist makes a lot of dough.
>I have 7,000 to invest, but the S&P 500 fund at Vanguard has a 10,000 minimum.

3+. Not all specialties have 5 years of residency. 
>Don't get trapped in the "I make 6 figures I can go out and eat and drink whenever I want, that's why I chose this career!" until you're on the other side of that half a million debt.


I went through this residency shit and rthen started making $25k/mo and after living like a college student for almost a decade, you just wanna be a bit more relaxed. 

Having said that, doubling your budget for everything is what I did,even though I never came close to spending that much but my upper threshold of  expenses when I became an attending were ~$6700/mo,I usually spent ~4500-5000 which is doable for /u/splee214 . He gets a better life and he still can tackle debts easily.

As I said, go to that subreddit, make a Post 'Need help lowering my internet bill". They will give you a decent rate.

>I was considering dumping all of our extra income into the credit cards at first. I figure once I pay one off, that if an emergency happens, I'll just use that until we get an emergency fund up


Divide the extra income/2 and put half of it for emergency fund and half of it for debt.

>Is an emergency fund 6 months of income or 6 months of expenses? I have 2 checking accounts, should I just keep the fund in the one that I don't get direct deposit, or should I open a savings account? Can you freely take money from a savings account?

You can withdraw money 6 times a month with savings account. Discover gives you 1.4% on savings, I would recommend that. 

Reread it! You are right!

But he can double his budget for everything and he would still be leaving within his means. That’s what I did. I used to live in Brooklyn during my residency years, after residency I doubled my budget for everything ( but never came close in spending 2x lol) and it worked out fine coz I could still save over $100k a year.
Wayy over IRA limit.
I am 99% sure there isn't one.
>Car insurance: $300

What cars are these? that's very high.

>Internet $80 

Talk to comcast over here /r/Comcast_Xfinity/ . They will help you reduce the health.

>Cc minimums $150 (yes 6 credit cards)

You will take years to pay off the CC if you keep making minimum payment. With a $80k/yr income between you two, there is NO reason for you to not pay it of fast.

>Food: $300 (unsure about this? We will have money for groceries for the first time since we are married. Is $300 a month a good amount? Im used to between $75 and $100) 

Should be fine for 2 people.

>Wife's phone bill: $100 

TOO much. /r/nocontract is what you should be doing.


>I'm not sure if im forgetting something.


6 months of emergency fund.




>We've had 17 year olds come in and then come back with their parents and buy cars.


I agree with taking everyone serious but a 17 y/o who comes into a dealership to look at expensive cars and then return with their parents almost never work minimum wage.  Those kids are different than OP's brother.  They function differently and think differently and ACT differently. 


>  Even when nothing is broken, the cost of a PM can easily be $1,000.00. So... No; he can't afford it.

It's 10k miles or 12 months and unless it's an AMG (even with an AMG), Maintenance till 40k miles is not as high, it's still high but not as much as you are implying. Mercedes sells a 4 year/40k mile prepaid maintenance plan @ $1330 for C300, if you know where to look, you can get it for much cheaper but yeah the maintenance is still higher than a Honda or a Toyota. 
>  As a rational person who grew up in India, 

Well I kinda did too, I know how India is. I know better than to trust  "India is best","India shining""Indians are the smartest people" bullshit that a lot of delusional Indians indulge in very proudly. 

If there is anything that India does better than anyone, it's food. LOL, apart from that, we are the shining example of mediocrity.


>If she's just an authorized user on the account she can dispute it directly with Equifax, Experian, and Trasnunion and get it off her credit reports.


I might be wrong but I have never heard of credit card joint accounts. It's almost certain that she might be the authorized user.
>Okay, so rather than complain about it, how do people get around these fee issues? One is to use Venmo between friends, sure. But what else should I be aware of?


You use an online bank like Ally,Discover or CapitalOne (they have B&M branches though).

For domestic transfers, use QuickPay by Zelle(if the Bank supports it) or ACH transfers. 
>You call the company and explain the situation. It isn't hard.

Oh it is. Try returning anything bought online without a receipt/order no. 

It is possible in B&M stores but not online.
>you have the stats on being beaten to pulp in a road rage incident (which happen all over the country all the time) in India compared to US?

I don't and it's higher but we were talking about getting shot,weren't we? 

I dont even live in India, I do consider India a "shithole" FWIW, I dont intend to return ever but if we are strictly talking about getting shot, then yeah my point still stands.
>Its blue book value is about $11,000, and is about $6,000 more on the loan. So yeah, not good.

You are underwater by a huge margin. Refinancing is going to be near impossible.


>. return them and then close the account? 

How do you reckon he return them? Only his card was used, not his online shopping account.


>Let him buy it and have a bag of “I told you so” when it gets repoed.


He won't even reach the point of having to say "I told you so", he would be shown the door within 10mins of entering a Mercedes dealership .

Autoloan@ 17 is anyway impossible.
>Thanks for the list, and since now I know that you’ve never actually lived overseas, where in India do you live?

I mean he is not wrong, you are less likely to get shot in India than anywhere in USA.
Dont move unless you have an offer letter in your hand.
If you /really/ want to maximize rewards get chase freedom + chase sapphire reserve combo. 

You end up with 5*1.5=7.5% on rotating categories, 3*1.5=4.5 on travel and restaurants.


>Do you think doing a product change to a rewards card later would be doable with Chase as well?

People have reported product change with chase cards. Doesn't hurt to ask on /r/churning. 

If you dont mind a hardpull, you can try applying for citi and then call the recon line if you dont get a response and then apply for chase. 

>I'm not sure if I could pay it off in 15 months though, that's why I was leaning towards the Citi options. I will look into it just in case. Thank you!

Citi in my experience is kinda hard to get approved. I was once denied with a 781 credit score and really good income because I didn't have different kind of credits. At that time my total credit limit across all of my cards was ~$120k with a utilization of a little under 2% and no missed payments ever.  Citi can be weird sometimes.
Look into chase slate.

$0 transfer fee.

I have also seen Chase be very generous with credit limits.
>. Then if I add another 50k in a few months like I probably will(just am hesitant to go and drop 100k into investments all at once...), it will be 10% bonds, 55% domestic stocks and 35% international stocks

How much do you need for downpayment?

How much do you need for 6 months of expenses?

Set those aside, invest every remaining $$.

VWELX is a balanced fund. 

https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/09/02/the-vanguard-wellington-fund-87-years-of-strong-pe.aspx

You can read about it here.


>HY stands for High Yield? Are there any particular ones you could recommend? I was thinking that the 10k I plan on putting into bonds would be used for a downpayment, and was thinking that the remainder that I would want to save for a downpayment should go to my bonds account as well.

Marcus by Gold man Sachs. Discover savings account. Capital One 360 Money Market Account.

>I will definitely look into opening up an IRA account(Vanguard also has good IRA accounts I assume) ASAP!

Vangaurd,Charles Schwab or even Fidelity. You can't go wrong with any one of them but yeah Vanguard is good.



>You don’t pay interest on a credit card if you pay it off monthly.


Misread it :| . I thought he was paying a CC debt he had.
>. I have no debt!(Besides a credit card which I pay off the balance of every month) :D

~~Why are you not paying it all off at once? You have ~$237k and you are still paying ~15-25% interest on a credit ard, what gives?~~

Ughh, i misread it. I thought you had a CC debt that you are paying off lol.

>Is $50k too much of an emergency fund/ amount to keep in savings for a house downpayment? Maybe I should only save $30k for emergencies and put the other $20k into bonds until I am more sure about the house? The 10k I plan on putting into bonds is already with the idea of taking it out for the house.


What I would do is have two HY savings account . 
So take a piece of paper, right down how much you spend every month x 6, put that in a HY savings account.

And then put the remaining in another HY savings account for your downpayment .


>I talked with an advisor today, and was thinking of dividing up that 50k as described below:

>$10k into Vanguard Select FundsTotal Bond Market Index Admiral Shares

>$24k into Vanguard Select FundsTotal Stock Market Index Admiral Shares

>$16k into Vanguard Select FundsTotal International Stock Index Admiral Shares

20% bonds, 48% and 32%. Looks good to me, you can also go for a fund like VWELX if you want to be less "hands on" or a target date fund.


Also max out your ROTH IRA, IRA for 2017 and 2018.
Shop around. Most of it will count as one hard pull.

Open a credit karma account so you know where you stand.

>I am absolutely fucked if <10 drinks a night counts as too much

It does. You are risking Cirrhosis by being a binge drinker.

>I found a 2016 Kia Optima for 13000 with 40K miles.

>? i do have limited credit because of some bad decisions i made with my friend group, my score is sitting around a 540.


No. dont. 

The problem here is that you are going to get a subprime loan with high rate and you will end up spending a lot of money.

Raise your credit card limit, make payments on time, raise your credit score and then get a Honda/Toyota. Stay away from Kia/Hyundai.


> I don't drink during the weeky and always those 5-7 drinks friday and saturday night wasnt bad.

Binge drinking is even worse. It's kinda ok (i mean not really but in context) to have a drink a day vs 5-7 drinks at once on a night. 

Personally,my sweet spot is 3. That's coz anything more than 3 or sometimes 4 for me means that I probably might not have that much fun @ sex so yea lol.
> How do I choose which bank?

You wont go wrong with Ally or Discover or Synchrony or Marcus by Goldman Sachs(1.55% APR Btw).

Capitalone has 1.4% APR on money market above $10k balance. 

You need to pay that debt off NOW. At $300/mo on $20k balance, you will never ever pay it down because the interest would be more than that.

As a doctor, you shouldnt be having 5 drinks+ every weekend. It's gonna fuck you over in long term.

You are living a life that is unhealthy and kinda out of your means. As I said I used to live on $60k a year in Brooklyn(First year of residency was just $55k btw) AND still saved money and I kinda have spending issues, there is no reason for you to make $70k gross in a low-er COL area and still not have money left at the end of the month. 

You will have to cut down on your partying. That's insane amount of money to spend on something that is going to screw you over in long term.
Do one thing.

Open a savings bank account with Ally or discover or any other online bank.  Direct Deposit 25% of your pay into that account. You wont see that money and because of that you will have to spend less anyway.

How big is your house?
> I have Cox, I'm fine without tv but I need internet. They told me without tv id lose bundle savings and itd end up being the same anyways. I get 300mbps which is way more than I need, I live by myself.

Do you have any other companies in your area? 

$100/wk on bars is high too. I go to bars every weekend, nice bars and I still dont end up spending that much, if you go out with people or someone, you can still split and there is no way you would end up spending that much. Invite people over, house parties are more intimate and can be just as fun and best of all they are like 80% cheaper lol.


Do you cook? You probably need to learn that too and that would free up like $800-900 out of those 1200.


You need to list down your proper expenses in OP. Every dollar you spent with line breaks (two line breaks lol).
What is your monthly take home?

You are spending too much on food and drinking. ~1200-1300 a month, that's insane amount of money.

You are also spending too much on cable. What company is it? Look into cordcutting (you are already half way there by using Netflix,Amazon).

Stop the partying and aggressively put all of that money in your CC debt.


No one making $70k should be broke. I used to make $55k-60k during my residency years in Brooklyn and still got by fine. You are living in a much lower COL area.

> When you've got enough money in a savings account to cover all your living expenses for three months.

6 months. 3 months is too short for an emergency fund and it's VERY easy to blow that much money away fast.
>. Would it be better to pay it all off and then use it for more each month to avoid interest or keep doing what i am?

Are you paying interest right now? 

Pay it off in full every month. Put it on auto pay.
> Like actually listen to customers and make iOS better. 

I agree but that's not innovating.  iPhone X is "innovative" in a way because of the things I mentioned.

iOS 11 is indeed worse than iOS 10 but even if it was better, it would be an evolution not an innovation. 

You have got the definition of innovation wrong.
Depends on your financial condition tbh but almost always a semi-used car is a good idea. Some cars like Hondas depreciate very less though.




You have to deregister iMessage,

https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/


>  Apple refuses to innovate.

Oh C'mon, it's not 2010 anymore, Smartphones are a mature technology now, what more do you expect them to do? 


FWIW, iPhone X's folding edge display that allows the "edge to edge" look and FaceID is an innovation so is their insanely fast A11 chip.
>It's mainly due to iPhones being a status symbol here in the US


Yeah iPhones are not a status symbol here. 
>5.) Apps - With Spotify I was able to break my music lock. All of the apps I have used on Android have been as good or better.

As someone who is using both iPhone X and Pixel 2 XL and trying to use the Pixel more than the iPhone, this is something I disagree with. While a lot of apps are similar, it's still quite obvious that iOS apps have much more polish and finesse vs apps on Android, that and Safari are the only two major things that's making me keep the iPhone X and not move to Android completely.

Only if we could get iPhone X level hardware with stock android and better quality apps and safari like browser, that would be a perfect phone for me.

iOS 11 has been garbage to be honest and the OS needs a major overhaul.

>  Men are very literal creatures and you have to be very direct.

Irrespective of being literal creatures or not, I never understand why an unusually large number of women/girls think giving "non verbal cues" or "signals" is a better idea rather than being direct. Be it when saying no OR saying yes, humans are not mind-readers,expecting them to behave like one is being an idiot and mo so just be a grown up.

That's not for the recipient. Individually you are allowed $5.6mil tax free as gifts, $11.2mil if married
There is not a CU/bank that would finance a 23 y/o making $25k without a credit history to speak of ~10k to buy a car.

If some how you find one to give you the money, the interest rate would be so high that by the time you are ready to pay it off OR refinance, the interest you would have paid on it would be in thousands.
You can pressurize them POLITELY. Tell them the phone worked fine before repair was sent in. Call AppleCare+ and ask for senior advisor.
>That works if you have a non-shit CC company. Not applicable if CapitalOne.

TBH, get a decent portable charger, they cost $10-12 for decent ones by Anker and will charge your phone for so much faster in your pocket.
>Ok. I don't know how much about electricity...just know you have to be careful about chargers cause it can hurt your battery.


iPhones (all of them) come with a 5W charger. It's gonna be PAINFULLY slow to use that charger on Pixel 2 XL .

Use the Pixel charger. It's so much faster.
> Actually, speaking objectively as someone who went from a 5S to a Pixel this time last year, I'd say that Google Assistant is severely lacking.

As someone who uses Both Pixel 2 XL and iPhone X, I find Google Assistant a lot more useful than Siri. Siri sometimes feel downright dumb and this is coming from someone who hasn't used a non-Apple device (smartphone or computer) since 2008 till I got the Pixel 2 XL last month.
I kinda did the same. I did keep my iPhone X though. I try to use the Pixel 2 XL more and more daily. But I really miss iMessage, even though it doesn't make a huge difference to me (people complain about green bubbles though lol), iOS also has undoubtedly higher app quality across the board AND Safari is just so much better to use. If somehow last two concerns were addressed by Android and Google made a hardware comparable to iPhone X's quality, I would throw that iPhone right away. 

Android has MOSTLY surpassed iOS, the only place it seems to lag now is web browsing (which for some reason just seems better on safari) and app quality.
>Raising the salary would make life difficult for good engineers in non-CS fields though.

The salary should be based on the prevalent wages. LCA filed for H1b has that field afaik, they really just need to enforce that. A blanket raise on salary wont help because a google engineer working in Chicago doesn't get paid as much as someone located in their Mountain View office.

So my point still stands, it's a small sample size and not you can't use it to define that entire group of foreign students who come for MS or foreign grads for it.

It's not like Apple is going to come and sit besides you on your couch and use the remote for you and tie to a chair with your eyes taped open and make you watch tv. Stop being dramatic.
It's $279 if you break your screen!

$550 if you break anything else, it's $550 for out of warranty repairs too. So if your phone stops working after 12 months, you will have to pay $550 to repair it. 

Apart from this if your phone dies or has a problem within first 12 months, you will get a free repair/replacement.


>i’ve seen those too, but i believe that’s for phones with no warranty.


What does warranty have to do with damaged device? Warranty means if something goes wrong with the phone within 12 months, they would cover it, it is not insurance, why would warranty cover your phone is your break the display?
That's an average score. So your particular device can be a bit faster or slower under the Standard deviation.

We can assume a lot of scenarios but if armed forces of USA and the government turns against it's civilians,we dont stand a chance. Yeah the guns would offer some resistance but what chance do they have against tanks and planes?

The point is this whole "If government turns against us" argument is  kinda redundant and it's not 1791 anymore where the playing field was level, civilians dont have the technology that armed forces have.
If American government turned against its citizens, guns won’t help them. There is no way citizens would be able to protect themselves from might of US armed forces.
>Family folks being conservative would of course react in weird ways. They might just say ok or get offended . Can't help it.


If they get offended, it's their problem. There are ways to get STDs without sexual contact. I get it done even with people I have dated or atleast make sure they are clean,tbh for a marriage, getting a full panel of STI testing done including Hepatitis should be mandatory.
Get it done. It should be a mandatory thing. It's the obvious thing to do tbh and I just talked about it from a F.O.B. from India about why people hesitate to ask for it and I was told the  reason was "culture"  lolol.

I make a base gravy of tomato, ginger,garlic and green chillis and onions. cook them, blend them and freeze the gravy and use it wehn required.

And then when I am making Paneer Tikka Masala,

I use bay leaves, black  and green cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and cook of  them in oil and then add half very finely chopped oinion to add a bit of texture to gravy but that's optional, after onions are well cooked, I put in the base gravy, a bit of besan and then garam masala(I make it at home coz I got too much time lol) and "gravy king" masala, red kashmiri chilli powder and cook it, add some cream, kasuri methi(powdered) and the grilled paneer cubes to it. Sprinkle some coriander and done!!

I also have a very high BTU gas range at home so it kinda gives it a restaurant like taste because of occasional high heat.

And I have been told that it tastes a lot like paneer tikka masala served in India. 


>How do people eat soup w their hands?


It's less of a soup and more of a stew.

Oh you mean you deal with people who start rolling as soon as it turns yellow on the other side. LOL. Just as annoying. My sister does it too sadly.
Not remotely true for iPhones sold in America OR India for that matter.

>IMPORTANT RESTRICTION FOR iPHONE, iPAD AND APPLE TV SERVICE.

>Apple may restrict warranty service for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV to the country where Apple or its Authorized Distributors originally sold the device.

Source : https://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/products/ios-warranty-document-us.html


Here is the same text from Apple India,

https://www.apple.com/in/legal/warranty/products/ios-warranty-emea-english.html

>IMPORTANT RESTRICTION FOR iPHONE, iPAD AND APPLE TV SERVICE.

>Apple may restrict warranty service for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV to the country where Apple or its Authorized Distributors originally sold the device.

Personally I would trust Apple’s own legal warranty document more than anyone else. 

What you are talking about has never been true for USA. 

Edit : Downvoted despite showing proof from the manufacturer’s site, lol. 

No iPhones have global warranty. It’s explicitly stated on their website under terms and conditions. 

MacBooks and Apple Watch do. 

Apple has never had global warranty on iPhones , I have been using them since the 3G. They always limit the warranty in the region the iPhone was sold in to curb scalping and a few other things.

But either way, iPhone in America is cheaper than anywhere in the world. With tax depending on what state you buy it in would cost like $740-760, iPhone 7 would be like $580 or so with tax.
iPhones don’t have global warranty. Sometimes (very YMMV) it is possible to get in warranty repair done globally but that’s not always the case and as I said is very YMMV.


Pay more, buy from an Apple Authorized Reseller and you will be fine.

Or better yet get an iPhone 7 which is cheaper, very fast (almost as fast as current android flagships) and kinda looks the same.
Lol autocorrect. 

I meant good understanding,
My sample size is much bigger. :)
> I will not get into crappy stuff in India like doctors & cut system

This exists in some form in America too. 
From what I have noticed in my family and extended family , a lot of people always talk to babies in native language (gujju in my case) and then by the time they are 3-4 they have good understanding of both native as well as English.
Acura is a luxury car. It’s not “Honda” per se. Acuras historically have had high depreciation.

Foxconn doesn't just make iPhones.They make products for Google,Apple,Amazon,HP,Dell,Acer,Nintendo, Hauwei, Xiaomi, Vizio , Intel, Microsoft , HMD (nokia licensee ie), Sony.

 Your laptop probably came from Foxconn's factory.

>You get a like new car 20 to 30% cheaper than new

Not if it's a Honda or a Toyota. certified preowned Hondas are priced very close to new ones.
>What? If you are in your late 20's or early 30's you can include your parents income? That doesn't seem right...

If you have access to your parent's money ,yes. Legally there is nothin stopping you from doing that.  
>You can include your spouses income on personal credit card applications.

Not just spouse's, if you are over 21, you are allowed to put in any income available to you(that includes parents too if you have nice parents lol).
>I hadn't thought about the interest rate. Do you think it would be different if I got the financing through my credit union?


Financing from car companies is usually very low, Honda runs 0.9% a lot. New cars are always cheaper to finance.
>That interest rate point is really giving me pause.

It can be an issue if the value of car you are buying is 20-30k+, for smaller amount it might be an issue.
>They're so expensive and the gas mileage is horrible. We're thinking CRV.

CR-V is a good car. My mom leased them for years before moving on to the new all new RX when it released haha! 

The thing with CR-V (as any Honda/Toyota vehicle) is the very high resale value, they just dont depreciate as much, having said that the CR-V just had a huge revamp. All-new everything including the drive train SO the older models have dropped in price because it being an older generation now.

Depending on how much you guys make and how your budget looks, you might be in for a tough decision.  I know this sub likes suggesting used car but imho, if you are getting a newer used vehicle, the price difference with Honda is usually so small that a new vehicle often makes more sense. eg, there is no point on spending $22-23k on a 2 year old car with 15-20k miles on it if you can get a new one for 24-25k and I have seen Hondas priced that high.


You can also look into RAV4.  

I was going to suggest HR-V but it's underpowered and cramped. I test drove it while shopping for my little sister and the 1.8litre ~140-142bhp engine is not enough.
Look into Subarus?


Chase Sapphire Reserve. 

I moved from Plat to CSR and the benefits are just  better..

CSR is essentialy $150 after $300 credit and then you get lounge access AND Global entry credit.

For primary spending, a chase freedom is much better card tbh.
>That's what I'm thinking too, although these new cars are about double what I was expecting to pay out. It's daunting taking on a $25k debt. That's 10% of my house. That seems so high.


A new civic should cost ~18k if you know how to negotiate. I recently priced a base Civic for that much for a friend. A fit costs roughly the same.
You should be able to get a 13-14-15 civic for that price. 

Having said that,

>Is used still the deal it used to be?

No tbh despite what this sub what would tell you.  New car interest rates are very low these days, new Hondas Toyotas dont depreciate as much. 

You are not really saving THAT much money buying a slightly used car when you factor in interest and a lot of things. 

Buying used is still a deal for luxury cars that depreciate quickly, not so much for Honda/Toyotas.

>Both our phones - $147

FWIW, you can cut some of this and then use that to pay for rent.

For Rent, I would say depending on where you live, look how much it would cost to rent a room and get as close to that as possible . He is your "landlord" per se.
> . A lot more realistic to see him whooping ass in Indycar.

I fully see him dominating Indycar in the 2nd half of his "rookie" season. Too bad we probably wont ever see that.
I pay >$3.20 for premium gas. 

Premium gas hasn't been $2.20 in a LONG time.
>To add to this, don't sell the car if it'll ruin your relationship with your father further.

My parents gifted me a fairly expensive car after college. After sometime I told them I didn't want it and then I sold it and gave them the proceeds.  Making up with the father as you said and then giving him the money should help in the long run.
> I don't know how far $80 in India will take you, but you're better off putting it in a savings account like Ally

India has a high inflation rate. CDs (or FDs as they are Called there) usually give 7% or so interest. Stock markets a lot higher.

None  of the advice given on /r/pf apart from basics of budgeting will apply to the OP because of how different the Economy of India is compared to ours. 
>Right. That's why I wrote index fund

I didn’t though.  I clearly mentioned target date fund. You corrected an already correct statemetn for some weird reason.

 
My statement wasn’t wrong. I said fidelity has higher expense ratio on their target date funds which is true. You “corrected” me saying that fidelity target date “index” fund had same ratio as vanguard’s and I wasn't talking about them now you corrected me because you didn't know what I was talking about existed OR you just misread my sentence, idk.

I didn’t mention index funds in my OP. I clearly mentioned “target date funds” which do have a higher expense ratio.  So as I said, I wasn’t wrong, you should have said “fidelity also has target date index funds which have lower income ratio”  but you corrected an already correct statement ,
Education does that to you.
The freedom target date funds have a higher expense ratio.

Gotta cut down on that one. 


Does your employer not have a health plan that they offer? You can look into getting a job (depending on what work you do) and get a job somewhere that offers health insurance.


Health insurance is vital. It can detroy you financially if something unfortunate happens, America's healthcare system sucks but it is what it is.
>  How is it unreasonable to think that someone can't easily dispose of $1,800 for an expense that wasn't accounted for?


I used to be an internal medicine resident making $60k living in New York City. Most people would say it's impossible to live in NYC making what I did  but I still saved $1000-1200 a month despite eating out 4-5 times a week and going out every weekend I wasn't working.

The point is if someone can afford to live in a nice apartment that from your description is kinda upscale, it is surprising that someone who can live in that kind "luxury" doesn't have SOME amount of money saved.

>a car crash on a new car by a recent uninsured driver

Wouldn't the insurance cover that? 




> Tax evasion?

There is a huge difference between tax "evasion" and tax avoidance. 

One is legal, other is not.

Also no, he earns the money in India so he pays the taxes there.
> I should buy funds with this yes?

I would ideally invest in target date funds depending on your retirement age. Fidelity target funds have high expense ratios. I prefer Vanguard for that sole reason. Lower ratios make a big difference if you have huge amount in retirement accounts.
Anker ftw. I don't know why people pay Apple exorbitant prices for accessories when companies like Anker sell accessories that are just as good and often higher quality and have longer warranty. 

You are basically paying 2x-3x for the same exact thing that is a lot more durable and comes with a very customer centric 18 month warranty or lifetime if you buy from Monoprice.

> Yes it's legit. We live in a nicer newer building. 

I hope I am not being condescending but uhmm.. how can someone who doesn't have $1800 in bank account afford to live in a nicer building with hotel style lobby?


Best way to save is to spend as less as you can. 

What does your budget look like?

How much you do you "spend" on yourself?
>You are right. I realised it too late. Not sure why every company gave me such mammoth quotations.


Yeah it happens. Shopping around can help. As I said try nationwide! 

Also look at how much money you would save by going liability only vs comprehensive. If it's a substantial amount, might as go with that. 

You can save even more $$ by avoiding the $4 toll and using the local road. Sometimes when I am on call, I take the highway but other then that I save $5/day just by taking the local road instead of highway and it takes me 12 mins more (6min each way).


Also look into gas gift cards, You can buy BP/Exxon GCs for 8-10% off. Basically 3-4 free gallons of gas every $100 from their official retailer(svmgiftcards) on eBay.  They run those deals once or twice a month.


You can make a post here,
/r/personalfinance 

/r/insurance 

Keep trying!

For me nationwide has always give me lowest quotes. State farm gave me a $2700/6 month quote for 2 cars LOL. I pay half of that right now with Nationwide and I have one at fault accident 4 years back, rear ended someone in icy conditions. 

Try seeing how much nationwide gives you. 


 Your company might have discounts too. 

Insurance industry is honestly a huge rip off. 
Dont get a combo. 

Get separate ones, so incase one craps out, you can just replace whatever stops working. 

Also that way you can upgrade your router without having to spend more money on a cmobo when you need to.

Here is what I pay for my model S. It's my last renewal, it has increased to $862 for 6 months this renewal.  But you get the idea.

What I would suggest is go to different sites and put in your details nad see what you get. You are paying wayyy too much for an older caer and an  insurance that is probably just covering you for your state minimum or a bit higher.

My insurance is from nationwide.

You can try getting online quote from them here,

https://www.nationwide.com/car-insurance-policy.jsp

Try Geico too. 

You can call up insurance agents in your area and see what they have to offer. From my experience (we insurance 7 cars in my family), calling them up and getting quotes can usually save you a decent chunk of money because all of them want their money.

Usually get a new quote at EVeRY renewal. Some companies like Geico reel you in with a cheaper  rate and then increase the rate gradually, so the key is to get a new quote every 6 months and you probably would save a decent amount of money.

Get the value of your car,

https://www.kbb.com/whats-my-car-worth/

The value of your car will help you determine if carrying a comprehensive insurance is worth it.

Get quotes for both liability only AND comprehensive insurance.

I am not able to make out the details from that. Maybe adding a line break might help!

Deductible would be $500-1000.

Post a screenshot of the insurance page without including the personal details. 

It should show the liability too.


Contact your agent and ask them how much it would cost to change the insurance to a Liability only.  

Go to Kelly Blue Book and check the value of the car and see if what you are paying is more than 10% of the value of the car.

You could potentially save a lot of money here.
> But I go for maximum coverage to avoid any accident liabilities.

A liability only insurance (as the name suggests) is just that. In older vehicles, when the value of your vehicle is low, there is no point in insuring your car because in case of a major accident, your insurance will basically mark it as totalled because the value of the car is lower than the cost of repair. 


A liability only insurance will basically mean that in case of an accident, the insurance company will cover all your liabilities but not damage to your car (because it's anyway of not that much value) and anything else will be covered by your umbrella insurace if you have one.

All states in America anyway require liability insurance(coverage $$ amount differs though) to cover any and all liabilities. Comprehensive collision (Which protects your car is not required and unnecessary in an older car).

https://www.statefarm.com/insurance/auto/coverage-options/liability-coverage

https://cashmoneylife.com/drop-full-coverage-auto-insurance-to-liability/

KBB gives a price of around 3-4k for the value of the car. Paying around 25-33% of car value on insurance is throwing money away by having comprehensive insurance on a 12 year old car at this point. Over last few years you have spent more on insurance than what your car is worth.

What's the deductible?
- Santander : Leaves Formula 1 altogether totally irrelevant of any Mclaren state of affairs

- Castrol : Only present due to the HONDA link, which is gone, and supposedly gets replace with Petrobras.

- Johnnie Walker : Was announced to leave as early as 2015, then got (temporarily) retained, and if i'm correct is going to Force India (again, not news and thus has nothing to do with 2018 prospects)

- Star Sports Network has changed its mechanics about which sport to cater, so again, nothing to do with Mclaren or trust for 2018.

- Calsonic Kansei only was present due to the Honda link. Honda gone = Calsonic Kansei gone. NOTHING to do with 2018 Mclaren prospects

- GREAT Britain and Northern Ireland : Totally to do due to Brexit, nothing to do with Mclaren's F1 2018 capabilities.

- Michael Kors : Leaving because Fernando Alonso's own brand is coming aboard, nothing to do with 2018 Mclaren capabilities

- CNN : Leaves as a sponsor because F1 shifts from NBC to ESPN. Nothing to do with Mclaren 2018 prospects.

Yup. I use Anker's Soundbuds Slim+ headphones with Aptx . THey work pretty good and are very comfortable. They were like $22 and I like them more than my Jaybirds.
> Yeah, but dongles look weird and are heavy compared to headphones.

FWIW, The adaptor that Google bundles in the box is very heavy and much bigger compared to what Apple bundles. I wish Google shrunk it to Apple's size.
>I am driving an old Camry. I pay around 530$ every 6 months. Initially I paid 1600$ a year. No traffic violations or accident record.

For a 12-13 year old car $530/6 months is high.  I pay $480/6 months for my daily driver which a '18 Accord. Shop around. If the value of your car is low (which it is) getting a liability insurance would save you a lot of money.
>Do you also pay road tax (12% cost of vehicle) while purchasing vehicle.

You pay sales tax to the state, plus county and city taxes and then you pay the fee for license plates to the DMV. For me that's $100-110/yr.
>  In last 6 years alone I paid 10 grand as insurance.

$1666/YR? what car you driving? a 12-13 year old car would not cost that much to insure. I pay 1800 for a '17 Model S. You are getting ripped off.
That's not the norm though.

And you compare a country with a median(not average) household income of $59,039 to India. 

I used to pay  like $3/gallon for premium high octane gas. Regular gas is like $2.5, so that is like 40rs/litre?

So What's exactly the point you are trying to make here?
>  He's pushed McLaren into abandoning Honda,

If you think McLaren was "pushed into abandoning Honda" or McLaren left Honda to please Alonso, you are talking out of your mind. No team is going to let go off $700million dollars over next 7 years to appease a driver who has 2 years of career left. They abandoned Honda because they were bleeding sponsors and were at the risk of brain drain. Losing key engineers like Peter Prod will affect the team far more in the long run than losing Alonso.

Only one group of people on this sub (or anywhere) will say what you are implying.
>  by throttling the device’s performance to keep battery life within their estimates.

They are not throttling device's performance to keep battery life within their estimates lol. 

They are throttling the device performance to make sure the phones dont shut down under heavy load when the CPU's voltage requirements exceeds that of the battery's capacity to supply and the throttling is more of a smoothening out of the peaks so only the peak performance is affected, your phone will still function the same when you are using safari or texting someone.

You need to educate yourself a bit on what's going on here.


> How about a comparison between a throttled 6S and a non-throttled 6S?
> 
> 

OP has that too.

>In the contrary to what you say, lots of users are complaining that they felt a big difference in performance, whether you “think” they would or not. So I guess that part is a little moot, don’t you agree?


I have 7 iPhones (7). I never sell old ones. The most used one is a 17 month old 6S, throttled, Geekbench @ 1800. I also have a 9 month old 6S that my mom uses unthrottled, The throttled one opens camera app 1 second slower (yes I timed it). 

>I really don’t understand how you people think... Is your 2010 car losing horse-power with years, if you keep it’s parts serviced? Of course, the new technologies that come with the newer cars, like traction control or handling advancements do not apply to your older car. But it’s as fast as you bought it.

Shitty analogy. You can't compare a mechanical ICE powered vehicle with a Li-ion powered electronic. Now you have brought that up, I drive a Tesla. Sometimes when the battery is low, I go easy on throttle, turn off the Air-con, turn off the stereo. Try to squeeze out the battery, same thing is happening here.

 >I can understand that the older CPUs running newer iOS versions may perform slower, due to more RAM requirement or even that the new software is not optimized for the old CPU (which is a base for another discussion), but it’s not what we’re talking about here.

Again, that's a factually wrong statement. CPU performance and RAM requirement are two different things. RAM is random access memory. The more memory, the phone keeps more apps open, the more opens remain on the RAM, the faster the phone brings them back on when you open them again. CPU is not relevant.

>A throttled 6 or 6S running iOS 11 is much slower than a non-throttled 6 or 6S running the same iOS. And that is a problem.


The thing here is apple is not throttling iPhones as you are implying. They are merely smoothening out the peaks. To understand that you need to understand how CPUs work, CPUs dont work at 100% power all the time. For basic tasks, your CPU might be running at 50-60%. Now I will bring up your car analogy, when you drive your car, you keep the RPM at 1-2k, sometimes you need MAXXX POWAAAAAHH, you go pedal to the metal (which we would compare to 100% CPU output of the iPhone). 

So throttled or not , your iPhone is usually running at a lower power output, sometimes your phone needs MAAXX POWAAAH and it goes 100%, in older phones, apple is bringing down that 100% to 65%. 

I hope that makes it clear. If not let me know and i will try to explain again.
>Expecting the device you bought to run as fast as it was, and as it was advertised is “entitlement” to you?


Did you read the OP? Link provided with proof that a throttled iPhone 6S is still faster than iPhone 6. Most iPhone 6S and above users won't notice any diffference, iPhone 6 users will be affected the most because of lower RAM. It's 2018, if you are still going to use a device which is not manufactured anymore and is basically at the end of it's product life, you are expecting too much if you think it's sitll going to run as it did when it released.
> Also any reputable websites to by from?

If you are outside NJ/NY, use Adorama.com https://www.bhphotovideo.com . Both are Apple Authorized Retailers. Go for the MacBook Pro over MacBook unless portability is what matters.
Yup all of this . 

Just one more thing, the phone doesn't feel like a $850 phone for some reason. You use iPhone X and then you use Pixel 2 XL and the iPhone X just feels so much more "premium".

Apart from that, there is not much wrong with the phone, it's a solid phone but it's more appropriate for a $699 price point than a $850 price point.

 A PU deal involves lubricants,it's the teams choice whether to use them or not.

Not true at all. 

I am into /r/churning, most credit cards have it. I have 27 cards on my name, 24 out of them have it.

Capital One offers it on all their cards.

Chase offers it on all their cards.

Discover does right now but they might stop it.

ALL amex cards have it.

All Well Fargo cards have it.

Mastercards, almost all of them have it. You can file the claim here , mycardbenefits.com

It's not rare at all. If you have a decent credit card, there is a high chance it has extended warranty. Simple as that. You are basically throwing money away by spending extra on either AppleCare+ OR AppleCare protection plan.

How many engine related DNFs did Renault have between 2010-2013? Not drivetrain, just engine related.
>Mercedes and Ferrari were both substantially up on horsepower and reliability.


It was not a substantial number like 30-40bhp. Renault's fuel economy was so good that RBR starting on lower fuel made up for the loss in power.
Renault was most fuel efficient V8.

It also had special exhaust design to help with blown diffuser.

3-5 years back , it would have needed me to run cables all over my house. Works perfect now. While wireless AC won't completely replace ethernet, it will work just fine for almost anything you throw at it for your personal use.

>If ethernet is useless

Never said "ethernet is useless", i said 802.11AC is where it's at and that holds true for personal use. 


>. Look S7 or S6 battery replacement costs. Very minimum as always have been.

They still cost $~50 here in USA. Having said that Samsung's display replacement for OLED displays on their flagship devices cost more than iPhone X display replacement which is an OLED too. 
> Agreed.
> 
> So you are comparing replacing a removable battery (which is available in many laptops) and replacing a non-removable battery?
> 
> LOL

How many laptops as thin and portable as the rMB or rMBP or MBA have removable batteries? How many high end ultrabooks have removable batteries? 

You want best of everything and that's NEVER going to happen. It's that custom "terraced" battery that allows the MacBooks to be that slim and the internal batteries also allows custom layout and proper organization of the motherboard and other components.

You are comparing a 5LB big ass laptop that has upgradeable RAM and removable battery with a 2.5lb computer that is less than 16-17mm at it's thickest and less than a mm (0.3mm) at it's thinnest.

One such example is the iPhone X, it has this very unique L shaped battery. 

While removable batteries are the easy options, it's impossible to design a laptop as portable as the MacBook Air or the rMB or the newer rMBPs while allowing for an external battery and it also affects their overall design philosophy.

> However, Macbooks badly need touch screen support like Windows

IMHO, Windows touchscreen implementation has been kinda intrusive at best. MacOS will not have touchscreen capability in near future. They have been very against it. 

What the MacBook line need right now is a price drop of the 12 inch MacBook to $999, killing the MacBook Air, updating the MacBook Pro to Kaby Lake R.

>Please search "HDCP protection macbooks" and you will know what I am talking about.

I know what you are talking about, what I am saying it's usually a non issue. Use a splitter if nothing else. 

Almost every issue you pointed out with Macs have a workaround especially the Mac App Store and HDD being Fat32, tuxera is where it's at. It's just a matter of knowing about them. 
> Lot of smartphone still have SD cards including flagships like S8. Their battery replacement cost is very minimum. So that is justifiable. May be 1k or 2k. If Apple has low repair costs, I would agree with you.
> 
> 

No 2017 flagship device has removable battery.

> Their battery replacement cost is very minimum. So that is justifiable. May be 1k or 2k


LOL have you even used a S8? It was my secondary phone. Battery crapped out 10 days back, Samsung is quoted  me close to around $60 to replace the battery. Where do you get these numbers? A brand new OEM S8 battery costs more than the number you have given.  

>You want to talk about 2017/2018?

>Who uses TN Panel as display in 2017? Who uses 1440x900 display in 2017? Some of the smartphones have more resolution than Macbook Air.

Didn't I already say that to the original response to your post? MacBook Air's display has no place in 2017 . WTF are you blabbering about LOL.

Isn't that what I already said wayyy before you replied to me? I already made a comment to the OP that the MacBook Air is at the end of it's product life. Stay away. LOL Sigh.


>Why use USB 3.0 technology at all? Why not simply use Wifi-Direct. Ask Apple to remove all ports from the machine. Ask Apple to include wireless charging as well. Why still use ports for charging?


Yup, Wifi Direct and USB 3.0 are interchangeable techs.  Wow.

Oh now are you saying you can use wireless charging to charge a laptop that needs 87W? LOL. Do you even know the limitations of wireless charging? Sigh. 

>I can also suggest alternatives. Macbook Air is definitely not a 2017 machine if we are having a debate about "2017".


Isn't that what I said? LOL. Again I made a post wayy before you replied to me saying that product is at the end of it's life.

>It is true. You can't play even purchased content sometimes. You can find plenty of articles all over Internet. Just type "HDCP Protection Macbooks"

It's the DRM shit that's affected and if you have bought shit from iTunes, it would play fine. Just use a splitter.


I like how you ignored my quoted posts but ranted about MacBook Air in 2017 when I was talking about Macs in general and your misconceptions . Sigh. It's funny how you went on a rant about MacBook Air when I didn't say a word in favor of it in any of my posts LOL. 




I use a rMB as my daily driver. 

I wouldn't' buy a MacBook Air right now. It's basically at the end of it's product life. 
>Why did older Macbooks allowed for that then? It is Apple's way to force people to pay high repair costs and also to lock them down.


Same thing as older phones having removable batteries. As technology progresses, custom logic boards/mobo designs requires them to solder the components on the mobo. It's what gets you a very sleek looking computer that other manufacturers still can't make. Most ultrabooks dont have upgradable ram. A lot of them dont even take SSDs. 
Good luck getting a customizable 2.5lb computer. Not everyone likes to carry around a 5lb laptop, if that's what you want, you are free to go with it.

> To connect ethernet, you need adaptor.

Who uses ethernet in 2017? 802.11AC is where it's at.

Not true. NTFS works. Just install Paragon NTFS or Tuxera. You can easily get K'ed versions of them,if you can't afford them.

That's not true at all.  

Not saying MacBooks are these perfect computers but the problems you are listing are more of an indicator of you not using the computer properly. All of the issues you have mentioned are "non-issues" for most users.

It's very easy to replace batteries on MacBook Air.  It's probably one of the easiest DIY "repair" you can do. It's a 5 step process.

I agree. That display has no place in 2017/2018 especially in a computer at that price BUT Apart from MacBook Air, all other MacBooks have excellent displays. MacBook Pros probably have the best display in the industry, it obviously has the brightest.

>Once I connected my mac book to my TV to watch a movie which was stored locally. Apparently, apple had some sort of detection mechanism because of piracy and broadcasting concerns. I couldn't play movie on laptop while connecting on HDMI. LOL. Apple restricts everything.

> To avoid the rush in escalators, lifts, toilets, and most importantly getting to the cabs. 

Well,

A busy airport will always be busy. Escalators, lifts, Toilets will always have people in them regardless of how much you hurry up mainly because of how many flights come and go at any time.  Same goes for cab. 

Unless you are travelling to an airport which has like 8-10 flights a day and the rush is there when your flight lands, it doesn't make any sense to hurry up. 

I fly in and out of Chicago O'hare and MDW, twice a week, they are always crowded, hurrying up makes no difference whatsoever and as I said before I am in 4 different flights 40 weeks a year and I probably fly more than anyone else on this sub, I have flown 163 times this year so yea.
> In life you have to pick your battles

I agree.

>In the long run losing or winning that debate wouldn’t make a difference to my life. 

IDK about that man. 12L invested would easily give you 8-10% over next 30 years. Probably more. That's like 12mil  when you are about to retire. Makes a difference in long term. 37 lac would end up giving you around 37mil (yes 10 times) at 8% over 30 years. More than enough to retire at 50 and live a very good life.

I really like my 2 XL. I wish the screen was a bit better, but it's not what I'd call bad...


I own both phones. In terms of pure hardware, iPhone X basically trumps Pixel 2 XL is almost all aspects. Much better display, better design (IMO), better build quality, much better display. One thing Pixel 2 XL does better than iPhone X is the camera.

As a life long iOS user, iPhone X doesn't have the software to back up the insanely good hardware. If only Android did apps as good as iOS but overall as of now I believe Android is much more productive than iOS is.
Which one are you even talking about?
You will get 2% on a 12 month CD right now if you open it before new year. It's their current promo of sorts. Look into it.

5.25% is a sure shot return. I would go for it. If it was 2.75-3.5%, it's still a good idea to invest instead of paying off that debt but @ 5.25%, paying it off is instant return.

12 months.

>3) Buy a house with cash that is no more than 3X your gross annual income.


That's a really really bad advice tbh. The current interest rates on mortgage are still low. You can easily invest that much cash and get return that would be more than the interest rate of the mortgage.

15 year mortgage rates are 3%. OP can easily make 6-7% over next 15 years investing that much cash.


>4) Aside from buying the house, do not change your lifestyle. $1 million sounds like a lot of money, but it won't last long if you start living the life of the rich and famous.

Yup +1.

And yet there is someone on /r/Apple who posted his benchmarks showing throttling at 83% health which according to Apple is a “healthy” battery. 
The problem is as someone posted on /r/Apple his iPhone 6S was getting massively throttled at 83% battery health. Trip to Genius Bar was useless because they said battery was healthy but his geekbench shows throttling. How do you tackle that?

Exactly but this was not the first time we met. I had been inside her home for a short time the first time we met. I picked her up and dropped her, drove around for over 1.5hours. I'd understand safety thing if we had never met before and hadn't talked to each other much but by the 2nd time we met, we got so well with each other that  one of her friend's said "There is no way you guys are meeting for the 2nd time". 

Well people are hard to understand.

>I understand she was interested in me, but it would have been way too awkward.

Yup, I know that feeling.
Idk about safety. I picked her up from her home the first time we met. I even went inside her home to pee lol. She was in my car for an hour and half. I knew where she works, she knows where I work and She knows that I am a doctor. I’d understand safety thing if we hadn’t talked much and were meeting the first time. But this was our second time seeing each other after talking to her all day long (literally hundreds of texts a day) for 6-7weeks. I mean I even knew her amazon login and SSN by that point lol.

"May" restrict.

What’s wrong here? 

Numbers don’t lie. 

Only Palmar and stroll had bigger gaps to their teammates.
> Fernando did not have a dip in form in 07. If he did, there would certainly have been a larger gap between himself and Lewis. 

How can you say that? 

Anyway, I am not sure if you saw 2007 but Alonso's struggles with Bridgestones (moving from Michelins) and Carbon Industrie brakes (he preferred Hitco) are well known. 

Bridgestones helped Lewis too.  His entire junior career was on brigdestonees! 

One more thing is Alonso usually qualified on higher fuel load (Silverstone fuel corrected lap was faster than Lewis by 0.5s, yes 0.5s)

Alonso's car was fit with Hitcos at Silverstone (he finished 30+seconds ahead of Lewis in that race) and then only once or twice Lewis finished in front of him.

I am not saying brakes were the sole reason for Alonso's below par season but it did play a part.

Having said that I do believe Lewis is faster than Fernando is BUT Fernando is probably closer to Lewis than anyone else on the grid.
>he is a rookie and qualifying margin between Alonso and Stoffel is low, like max and Ricciardo

Either you are a troll or you dont understand numbers,

Alonso vs. Vandoorne        

Median 0.36 % 

Mean   0.34 %

--------------
Max vs Ric

Median : 0.1%


Gap between ALO and Stoffel is 3rd largest of all the teammates.Only Stroll and Palmar have been farther away from their teammates at 0.96% and 0.99%.

>  McLaren wanted a very, very small engine for them to have a lot of freedom with the aero.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Honda-s-F1-boss-opens-up-about-team-s-rough-year

Some analysts say that the technological troubles you encountered stemmed from McLaren's "size zero" concept, which called for an extremely small power unit. Do you intend to make any size changes in 2016? 

 
A: No. F1 cars cannot go fast without proper consideration given to air resistance and the way suspensions move. It's important to minimize the size of power units so that they don't interfere with the car's design. ... **McLaren once told us that we don't have to be aggressive in downsizing our power unit. But we are determined to shrink the size by whatever means possible.**


And then Hasegawa said 2016 PU was even smaller and then 2017 was even lighter and better packaged. The size was not the problem, the concept was. 


>So by 2016, they maxed out the engine's potential. The biggest problem was the turbo, which was too small because it had to fit inside the "V" of the engine, otherwise the package would be too large. Ferrari made the exact same mistake in 2014, which makes it all the more amazing that nobody from either McLaren or Honda thought this might have been a problem. Or they did but by then it was far too late.


The compressor wasn't really inside the V in 2016. They increased the size in 2016 and the compressor was not really inside the V, it was so high up that it could basically be considered above the V upto some extent. 


The old concept hit a wall. The compressor was too small and there was nothing more they could do about it.

Now there will be people saying they changed from size zero to mercedes like concept which is only partially true. Honda always had a mercedes like concept(not completely though) this year they went with full on Mercedes copy (including the shape of the oil tank and the MGU-H shaft). The 2017 PU was even better packaged and lighter than 2016 PU so size zero in it's true essence was never abandoned.
> when a driver has been stuck in traffic, had a bad set of tyres, car problems, less updates to the car, blue flags, a bad strategy which harmed the 'raw pace' because of tyre saving and many more stuff which can influence a performance. 

You dont get strategy, blue flags and all that in quali. It's clear that th OP is talking about quali gaps. 
>They had to overrev it because of bad driveability, but why was the gearbox shifting so bad?

Something because of vibrations. IIRC, The vibrations from the PU was so bad that they had to lift while changing gears.

>I think he's saying he doesn't believe the time penalty would be that big.

1kg=0.04s is well known.

10kg = 0.4s. 

He just doesn't want to accept that Ericsson can be faster than WEH. I am not a fan of either one of them but you can't argue against facts using opinions, that's what he is doing.
>  He's all of 3% or so taller than Wehrlein but he's going to be 15% or more heavier because of that, bullshit.

Wait what? how does this make any sense?

You can be 6ft and 200lbs or 6ft and 150lbs. 

You can be 5ft 5 inch and be 180lbs and you can be 6ft adn be 180lbs.

How does your argument make any sense?
>Wouldn't Ricciardo be a bit heavier too since he's quite tall?

He would. The point here is F1 cars have a "minimum weight" that can be homologated(basically deemed legal) to race. For 2017, it's 728kg including the driver. Most teams run at 728kg by using ballasts or atleast aim to get as close to 728kg as possible .

RBR is way below that limit so only penalty RIC has is the ability to run less ballast vs Max. Both cars still race at 728kg. 

Sometimes, the cars are overweight or heavier than teams would like, this leads to the team to run no or less ballast and then the drivers have to lose weight. for eg: Mercedes at the start of the year, Force India, Sauber (they are still heavy).

So for eg, if we assume Sauber's car weights 735kg with Ericsson in it but with Weh it's 725kg so WEH's car gets to use 3kg ballast to help with balance and to be legal. Ericsson's car then would be 7kg heavier because of his higher weight, causing him to lose 2/3tenths in speed.

I hope that makes it clear.


>Propaganda from his management to try and make him look less bad compared to WEH.

Well he LOOKS heavier. It's not like he has the same weight as WEH.

It's also a well known fact that Sauber is a bit overweight (F1tech). 

A heavy driver + a heavy car = time penalty. We can't debate the facts.

>Wehrlein is super light tho, Ericsson/Hulk/Stroll/Kimi are probably the heavier drivers.

He is. I did read somewhere that Ericsson being in a car that is already above minimum weight limit costs him like 2-3tenths. Big if true especially seeing how close he is to WEH in pace.
RIP Ericsson. The guy is like 10kg heavier than WEH In an already overweight car.

Discard the prepaid sim.

>You can't unlock anything iPhone 5s and up without the carrier.

It's over simplification to put it that way.
> They were running a pretty high downforce setup in Brazil though. They tested two different versions during practice and they were 10 or 12 kph quicker on the lower downforce package. But McLaren decided on the higher downforce setup as Alonso and Vandoorne preferred it as the car was more stable.
> 

They went with what gave them the quickest lap time . That's how it goes by.

Regardless Mercedes has A MUGH HIGHER sustained power output, they can run a lot more downforce so McLaren being able to match Mercedes is a huge thing. If McLaren is able to match Mercedes' downforce level with Honda's PU, a much more powerful lets them run even more downforce.
>Both Bottas and Alonso are close through all corners, there really isn’t much between them at all. The time loss on the straights totals to ~1.3s (0.5s in Sector 1, 0.35s in Sector 2, and 0.45s in Sector 3), which reinforces the observation that the two were almost identical through the corners, and the claim by Alonso that the chassis is up there with the front runners. It’s perhaps not quite on the level of Ferrari/Red Bull, but it very well could be if McLaren are compromising their wing levels to compensate for their power deficit.

If McLaren can match Mercedes in corners while running a Honda PU, I wonder how good their chassis really is. They were clearly not running their highest downforce config (T-wing, rear wing makes that clear).
WEH gap to Ericsson is 0.040% . Ericsson's pace is more or less on par with WEH. So is Ericsson underrated or WEH overrated?

For comparison Palmar and Hulk were over 0.9% 

Ideally you wouldnt even need to go to TMO, just call them and they would transfer the sim.

But tbh,moving to a MVNO ---> /r/nocontract would be much cheaper.

>He deserved both, but 2012 if I had to pick

2010 was his 2nd weakest season after 2007. 2012 on the other hand was probably his strongest along with 2006. 2006 was just a bit better. 
>In the box where it says your annual income, there should be some explanation or instruction that says whether you can include spouse's income. If you're able to, why not with your higher credit score?

You can still order one and return the one you bought from bestbuy when it delivers!
Discover has been a pain in the ass lately with price protection. I have slowly changed to citipricerwind. The company discover uses for price protection randomly denies claim if the price is too low and asks for a verification on stores letter head  despite providing them with flyer scan AND screenshot from website and refuses to hear when we try to explain to just google it up to verify. It all started after people went crazy on it on slickdeals YMMV walmart deals.

How much of that is because McLaren went from being best of the rest last year in 2nd half of the season to what tthey are right now?
Lol spec 4 has been a Topic of discussion since early season now.

Do you really think Mclaren would have split with Honda if spec 4 was real or on time and performed as expected?

> Yet Alonso did it anyway ánd made it stick. I think that alone says enough.

Well that "Alone" doesn't say it enough. If it was someone like Stroll who did than that "alone" would have said enough but it's one of the greatest drivers of all time doing that. 

Alonso was also the only guy to overtake a car in hungary this year and that too round the outside.

He was also the only person to overtake a car in S3 in Mexico and made the move stick too only for GRO to just cut the track.

>  Bahrain 2017?

I am pretty sure Bahrain 2017 was confirmed on Japanese media as a MGU-H issue. It was a pretty important failure too because it made them introduce a counter measure. Look on autosport forums for posts by marumasa. He used to post these really good translations from Japanese media that were very informative but he was a Honda apologist of sorts and stopped posting when slowly steadily the vibe changed from pro-McLaren Honda to a bit anti-Honda-ish.
>I don't remember where, but there was one race where the mechanics said afterwards that they could not find a single problem with the engine or the car.

It was Spa. But Honda F1 chief said they called him in the pits as precaution.  As I said there is not one instance where he "parked" the car. Team retiring the car as precaution and then finding nothing wrong doesn't' count.
>You do know the MGU-H is gone with the new regs, right?

New regs is 2021. 

He was talking about 2018.
> I dont think the McLaren's are quite as unreliable as its made out, several times Alonso has ended the race when it was clear he had no chance of points for an 'engine problem' that didnt actually stop him driving.

Prove it. 

It has been DEBUNKED multiple times. 

Show me one proof where it says Alonso “parked” it. 

Don’t say Spa because Hasegawa himself said they asked him to retire the car as precaution . 

As I said tell me one race out of 19 where he just retired the car and parked it. 


Eh it doesn’t work like that. Honda is not going to go from using >10-12 MGU-H in one season to 3 over entire season in one winter.
Cost of material doesn’t include R&D , labor , logistics ,retail,continued software updates for years and so on. That’s just bill of materials. That’s it,
> But it’ll be the closest competition they’ve ever had since they became a top team.

2012 McLaren ie MP4-27 was just as fast as RB8! 
>  It’s also the first time Newey (and by default, Red Bull too) has built a chassis against another team with a similar budget and the exact same engine, this could get very tense over the next couple of years.

But the situation is not the same. Renault PU integration for McLaren would be much different and difficult than it is for RedBull .First year vs >decade.
>If you’ve used a back button it’s 10 Times more natural honestly iOS has the shitties “multi tasking” features.

>Not the same at all lol

tbh, I prefer swiping over back button. It just feels so much more natural.
>I have missed the physical back-button, although I reckon I can get used to iOS' workaround.

Swipe on the left edge!
That Sauber wasn't the backmarker Sauber of today even Kobayashi was on podium.
>Wanted him so much they signed vettel while Alonso was still under contract and hadn't signed with any other team...

Well we can put it this way too,

Wanted him so much that they tried signing Alonso till 2019 and then went to Vettel when Alonso didn't play ball. 
>I don't know why but it makes me laugh, at this point Honda it's just "something" that was bad and has been changed. Everyone at McLaren talks about Honda like a sort of cancer that they get rid of.

You have to think how bad Honda was for McLaren to let go of a 700million out of a billion dollar deal for a short term bandage. Honda's failure has been mind bogglingly bad.
> He burned bridges with Ferrari.

Ferrari wanted him till 2019. There is a whole discussion on front page about it. 
Wouldn't Alonso Perform even better in a car that's easier to drive?
> Vettel was already in position in Brazil 2012 behind Schumacher and would have won the championship even in that position.

Both STR drivers were behind Schumacher who easily let him past too.

I went with them from Verizon, the 8mbps doesn't really bug you as much you think it would AND cricket is not just AT&Ts MVNO , AT&T even owns them.
>I see it more of fans are blowing things out of proportion


More like the "toxic Alonso" brigade blowing it out of proportion.
>He kinda is wrong, the couple of tenths he had over Vettel and the fact he doesn’t make mistakes would’ve given him the wdc this year

In the 8th year of being with the team? Which other driver stayed at a team who promised him championship capable cars for 8 years? Even Lewis left after 6 years despite winning a WDC with McLaren.
>I heard they're planning on taking engine penalties in Abu Dhabi.

but why tho.
>As well as this, i think we all know that Ferrari was gagging to sign Vettel- and there is no way in hell that Alonso would have Vettel as his team mate and vice versa. The guy still doesn't like him even today.

If OP is talking about the same Mark Hughes article I am thinking of, if it's true than Vettel didn't come into picture until Alonso refused to sign for the extension and wanted exit clauses and choice of technical staff. 

And tbh, Alonso would want Vettel as teammate so he can show the world how he is the better driver, he really doesn't think of Vettel as his equal.
> so occasionally matching Alonso is now considered a huge success.

He is hardly "matching" Alonso now. He beat him in Malaysia and that's it. Alonso is just too far ahead of him.
>Spain - Alonso punted by Massa from P7 at the start - 6 points

Actually p6. Bottas retired.

>Japan - Vandoorne punted by Kimi from P9 - 2 points

TBH outside on t1 in Japan is almost always suicidal.

They have also missed out on over 35 points due to reliability issues.
>Brilliant of Alonso in the race. He made sure to stick to Massa to get free DRS all race long. Would guess that made quite the difference in the end as it negated the lack of power quite a bit.

What's even more brilliant is that MCL32 was capable of running so close in dirty air and still be competitive.

Do you even see this rear wing? It's their low downforce rear wing used on tracks like Spa. 
>The key argument is that they're not willing to do it nearly as much as they'd have to with that engine.

Not really. It doesn't work that way. They go with the setup that is fastest for them . All of this "to make engine look bad" bullshit was started by Honda apologists.
> Can modded Xboxs run pirated Xbox games?

yes

Alonso spent 90% of the race being in Massa's DRS and was still fast in dirty air.

well technically he was but uhmm....just didnt have the power to get past :( 
Alonso spent almost entire race within DRS Of Massa. :|

See the thing, BMW was always a younger gen car vs Mercedes. Mercedes has had a huge huge makeover in their image over past few years. 
Well tbh, you did say things like this which are kind of wrong because the display does utilize Apple's patents, two of them infact!

>Yes, vague statements without specifics when using Samsung's patented technology is marketing. 'Custom designed' can simply mean they designed the dimensions.


>Feel free to point out how what they do actually differentiates from the Samsung pentile display we know they're using though.

>That's just marketing, the same way they call it super retina. The same way they talk about anti aliasing when that's a part of Samsung's technology. Can you please point to the specific difference and not just Apple's empty platitudes in their marketing?

And most importantly this,

>If by specifications you mean size, then sure. Other than that it's a normal Amoled display based on everything we know. The only difference being Apple potentially asking for better QA and making sure all displays are uniform in quality.

which basically means you were talking about it being an "off the shelf" part. 


But yea.

>Having said that, I honestly didn't think the lack of a chin was due to Apple doing something different with the display and it's certainly fascinating. **I wonder if this means other devices can't lose the chin now because of Apple's patent?**

Maybe. Maybe not. Apple doesn't have a patent on chin-less phones though. Apple used a smart way to come up with a virtually bezel-less phone. Maybe some other company might come up with something else. I am not patent lawyer lol but utilizing the bending technology to get a virtually bezel-less phone might very well be an Apple-specific thing for some time in the future.

> It would be like saying the A11 is just an exynos chipset with different passive cooling or something.

Hmm I agree.

Basically the OLED panel in the iPhone X has little bit of Samsung's tech and little bit of Apple's tech . Samsung's tech makes it possible to have one of the best OLED displays available, Apple's tech allows them to integrate it seamlessly into the chassis and giving that true edge-edge look.

Last year Mercedes lost $20mil on their F1 team, that's the cheapest marketing campaign they have.

So what argument you got now?

>And even still, everyone, including u/makecry who replied to you about saying he's going to start copy/pasting your post and went ahead and spammed it to me too, is talking about the panel itself and not how they made it bezel-less. I'm not sure how relevant this discussion of how they made their phones bezel-less is when everyone is talking about the quality of the displays themselves.

It is because you were harping around telling everyone how the part is an "off the shelf" samsung part where as you have been proved wrong and the fact is it in an apple designed panel manufactured by Samsung Display Co., Ltd just like Apple designed SoC are manufactured by TSMC. 

>is talking about the panel itself and not how they made it bezel-less. 

By folding the display is how they made it bezel-less. Look at teh video. I can't stand Johnny Ive's way of speaking that they have conjured water out of thin air but you will get the idea.
 

>Compared to Honda, Red Bull is tiny.

> I honestly haven't figured out how Mercedes afford to build theirs.

Daimler AG had revenue of >150billion euros last year. They got insane amount of money.
>But Mclaren cars are more expensive Never know that Mclaren was that small


McLaren started selling cars in 2010. They sold ~3200 cars last year.

Honda sold 4.7 million cars last year.


>I didn't know that Mclaren is a small company

Honda's 2016 revenue was $130billion. McLaren's last year's revenue was like $850million. Honda's revenue was 150 times the revenue McLaren had.


R&D and manufacturing a PU is a big investment right now, McLaren doesn't have the resources to do it. 

And if a big company like Honda with their immense resources can't get it right, How can you expect a small company like  McLaren to get it right?


McLaren also is a relatively new company when it comes to building roadcars. McLaren Automotive was founded in 2010. They sold like 1600 odd cars in 2015 and 3200-3300 in 2016. If the growth they are having continues, they might consider building their own engines in future but I dont see them doing it right now.

I haven't restarted my MacBook Pro in 9 months. Something is wrong with yours!
> I still have no intention of ever switching to iPhones for personal use because I can't stand the OS compared to a clean version of pure Android. But for the iPhone lovers out there.

TBH, everyone should use what they prefer. The "iOS hate" that some people have is BS and seems to be stronger than the "Android hate", a lot of people I have seen don't give a shit about Android but lot of Android users just have this irrational hatred for anything Apple lol. 

I like that you said you prefer Android. To each his own.

Personally, I have tried liking Android, I just can't seem to get into it. When iPhone X was announced,I went out and bought a S8 because it was available for $575, nearly half the price and returned it within 1 week. I might give Pixel a try someday, the last android phone I used was Nexus 5 for 5 weeks and it was a great phone, I wish Android had higher quality apps though. I do wish iOS had a bit more "customization" features and Android had more finesse but we can't get everything we want and at the end of the day we go with what we think is best for us. The anti-android and anti-iOS armies can go suck a bag of dicks lol.


There is a thread on autosport forums that has a discussion on qualifying gaps between teammates.

I am too lazy to do it myself lol.
>I wasn't watching F1 when Red Bull was the best team, so I don't know too much about him. (Except that he is a top cunt)

He almost beat Vettel in 2010 when he was 34-35 and then fell off. So yea he wasn't that bad, I am pretty sure he would have won a lot more if he had a decent car in his younger years.
I got one of each iPhone X 64GB(both colors), I would trade for the 8 plus @ the right price!
>Thus, Samsung OLED technology was definitely superior and contributed to the iPhone X display

It is. I am being downvoted for saying Apple had a say in the design and then proving it with a detailed write up by someone who even included the patent numbers of the tech used in iPhone X display. The patents that are owned by Apple.

No one is denying it's made by Samsung. Samsung is the only company capable of producing OLED panels in the quality and quantity that Apple requires. LG is too far behind.

Happened to me after 10 years. Got cheated on too . Sigh
Alonso was winning karting championships in his early teens and was a f1 driver at 20 years of age and then before that had a short junior career. I doubt he was working as a mechanic before f1.
A terrible driver who is 0.04% off the hyped WEH.

For reference, Palmar was 0.9% off pace to Hulk. >20 times the gap .

Meh, just go /r/nocontract and use cricket which is wholly owned by ATT, much lower monthly cost and just pay full price for the phone upfront. You will end up saving $$$.
Honest question : Why on the earth would  you order from bestbuy when Apple is selling it ?
>They seem to completely ignore the fact that the iPhone X display IS a Samsung display until the very end.

That's like saying A10 chip was a TSMC chip at the end. 

The display is designed by Apple. Samsung makes it for them. Just like Samsung used to make A9 or A8. 

It's not an off the shelf part.


I will wait till DisplayMate gives their judgement though.

Edit : Looks like I am going to get down voted for stating the facts . 

Here is a detailed write up,

> The problem is that the ones using them are the real valuable users who have much higher chance of buying stuff by clicking ads.

That's not necessarily true.  I exclude youtube from my adblocker  and I hardly ever go and get stuff by coming across an ad on youtube and anyway a lot of ads are targeted so yea!

>Anyway, thanks. I will look into it.

Good luck!

Not going to happen tbh, not unless Samsung's near monopoly on OLED displays is broken. 

> I've tried Face ID on various android phones and the main issue (besides those with the sun, etc) is that you want the phone unlocked without stuffing your face into

No other phone has "FaceID" right now. Apple uses something completely different. It basically creates a 3d image using Infrared and dot projector. Look it up, it's pretty cool.
>And I'm not saying that everyone who uses an Apple product is an isheep. I'm specifically talking about the certain group of people who froth at the mouth about Apple and will buy anything Apple makes and support everything Apple does, of which there are a disturbingly large amount of.

How does that affect you? How does someone spending their money to guy the product they light affect you? You buy the things you like,they will spend their money on the things they like. It's not like you are forced to spend your money on Apple or something.
For India, the $ to INR conversion ratio helps. Even if you are making $500 a month, that still translates to 32-33k a month, while it's obviously not much but you get the idea about what I am trying to say here and while the usage of adblockers is increasing, the last major report I read said 11% of users are using them, I reckon the number is much smaller in India, for me personally even though I hate ads, I make it a point to exclude youtube just to help the youtubers. 

> Also, half of the audience(new internet users) may prefer Hindi channels.

I am sure but tbh, I don't think there is a top notch tech oriented youtube channel in Hindi. I tend to stay away from most Indian tech youtube channels because I don't live in India and most Indian channels have content that is targeted to people using low-mid tier android devices that I have no interest in lol nor are available where I live. 

But yea, if you think you can do something that no one else is doing properly, go for it, start it small and see. If people like "technical guruji and "GeekyRanjit" can hit it big, I am sure someone with better oration and production value should too.

>  I am sure I can do better than most of the current channels,

Most Indian tech channels are shit. The only person who remotely gets close to the tier A reviewers is iGyaan. Everyone else is shitty with that GeekyRanjit being one of the most unprofessional reviewers I have seen.

If you are planning on a channel, I am sure something with high production value would pick up. It's an oversaturated market, yes but there are hardly any high quality tech channels. The problem though is that there might not be a "target audience" for a decent channel lol.
>  Just don't feel it's a complete iteration due to lack of touch id

TBH, TouchID is gone. I like TouchID but Apple is not bringing it back.
>if you were to buy a prepaid iphone like this would you be able to switch it over and use it with another carrier i.e. t-mobile?

It depends. Straight talk is hard to unlock (nearly impossible).

BBY sells GoPhone iPhone SE @ 150 which can be unlocked after 6 months of use or within 45days or so of postpaid use and then can be used with another carrier or you can use R-sim and use it with another carrier.


Get a straight talk iPhone SE for $130 and use it as iPod touch. You get a better spec device at much lower price.

>eh, it's a deal breaker.

I used to think the same.  Been using iPhone 7 since a year. Missed it 4-5 times since I got the phone. 3 times out of the 5 times was in the first month.  Now I dont miss it,It would be nice to have one but not having one doesnt change my life.

AFAIK,

2 out of 3 have to agree to the rule changes. FOM(basically bernie till recently),FIA and strategy group. Till Bernie was there he would just side with FIA and override strategy group. With hybrid PUs, FIA and Strategy group were in favor and Bernie was against it.

I might be wrong here and completely talking out of my ass but AFAIK, this is how it is.
> No headphone jack, 

TBH, lack of headphone jack is blown way out of proportion. Once you get used to it, you stop missing it.
aah!  When you plan on getting a credit card, PM me, I will help you select on with decent benefits like the ones I mentioned. 

I always buy electronics with discover or amex. Extended warranty they provide has saved my ass multiple times.
A lot of credit cards offer extended warranty and priec protection.Always buy electronics with those cards. You get extra 12 month of warratny and if price drops within 90 days you get the refund of the difference.

What Credit cards do you have?
Nice! Did you use credit card that has price protection? File a claim if price drops and your card would refund the difference.

Staples would price match it for 110%. So it would have been a bit cheaper there.
How much did you pay?
I'd wait till blackfriday. The new iPad was @ $278 few days back on BBY. I'd go for that over iPad mini 4 coz of newer SoC.
>Me too - but it was supposedly on a flight from Zheng Zhou, China to Anchorage last night?!

Someone said that but it obviously wasnt lol.
>Same. I originally had the 11/10-11/17 date but it got moved up. I’m curious if it’ll arrive on time. I mean, UPS says it will so...

Yup I had that date too. It takes no more than 14-15 hours to fly to midwest from HKG. I am sure it will be here on time. Where are you located?
>$180m in annual sponsorship to Mercedes. 

You sure about that number? 180mil would account for over 1/3rd of their budget.

Lol the only issue with the entire situation is that I am an impulsive buyer . haha.
I am selling the 8+ coz my iPhone X is coming. I dont need the case anymore :)
HMU! I am gonna sell the phone on friday so anytime after friday if you are interested, I can ship it out the same day! :)
Yea lol. Yikes.
> You think it'd be thick enough to be protective?

It should be. I can't honestly give you a definitive answer but silicone would "absorb" shocks better than leather I guess.
They have the best ICE and most efficient ICE too.
iPhone 6S Unlocked 128gb, just replaced by Apple, still in the original plastic, unactivated ~85 out of 90  days of warranty remaining on the replacement phone.
I got the Navy Blue Silicone Case bought a few days after the 8+ was launched. You got a number in mind?

iPhone 8 plus 64 gb. Like new. Warranty till 09/2018

iPhone 7 128gb Jetblack, replaced by Apple last week, still in original plastic. AppleCare+ till 09/2018.

> In 2014, they were long-time Mercedes customers and only managed to be on P5

In 2014, Ferrari had the 4-5th best car. 

2014 was odd for McLaren because of a lot of things. 1)Wrong fuel, not allowed to develop their own fuel costing them 40bhp which would be as much as 0.8-1.0s depending on track. 2)Withholding of key PU details because Honda was going to come into the sport with McLaren 3)Average chassis/aero.


Since 2014, McLaren has reamped their aero department which is now led by former aero chief of RedBull ie Peter Prod.
>. Whats your estimated release date

release as in delivery? 3rd.
Mine is sitting in China since 30th.

Arrived - ZhengZhou, China, Monday, 10/30/2017 at 1:35am.


Anyone else on the same pallet/consignment?

>McLaren beating the midfield is a guarantee if their chassis talk is true.

They are not really saying it's the best one out there but there has been ample evidence of it being a good car.
P5-P6. I dont see them being ahead of McLaren.
>  The ice is the easyest to part of the whole package. Any team can make a good ice

Both Honda and upto some extent Renault has struggled with ICE. Why do you think Honda is so fuel hungry? 
>  Mercedes will have 3 more seasons of performance advantage.

Merceds will have an advantage in 2021 rules too. The ICE remains the same. Mercedes has the best and most efficient ICE>
>Mclaren have had this nice talk of having the best chassis,

Show me one news article where McLaren explicitly says "We have the best chassis". They haven't. They have said they have a car much better than the results show and with a decent PU they will be able to fight in the front of the grid. 

Even in Mexico, Alonso said "We had the best car today" and he meant their car was working better than others at Mexico which has often been true for their car when there have been issues with grip on the track and tire temp problems.

Before  Malaysia he gave an interview and said they lack a bit of downforce and mechanical grip, it's on autosport forums, I am too bored to link it but you will find it if you look in the car thread and then they introduced new suspension,new bargeboards, new FW and that has clearly helped them a lot.


Jonathan Neale himself said to Ted just few weeks back they can't say how good the car is, only that they have a good car and tbh there has been ample evidence of that including that Alonso was the only car to successfully overtake another car at Hungary and that too on cold tires.


>I expect Mclaren to be taken for a ride by red bull, Mclaren being comfortably slower next season then them.

No one in his right mind expects McLaren to beat RedBull . McLaren will be in it's first year of using Renault PU. RedBull has been working with Renault for 10+ years now and have been a pseudo-works team for them all along.
Craigslist. 
>Ricciardo set his time in way different conditions, such as temperature, track has been rubbered up way more

Similar conditions was the report IIRC. Regardless, the mean gap was 0.21% in 2014 which more or less aligns with 0.2 seconds .
 


It's too far fetched tbh.
Unlocked yes.

CDMA + GSM.

I dont have a price in mind but would entertain any good offer :)
>Specially now when they contradict their own long term plan that you need to be a works outfit to win stuff.

As Martin asked Ron "Is this is a crisis for McLaren?".  If it wasn't back then  it certainly is now. 2017 was worse than 2015 for Honda. Worse results, more grid penalties. McLaren HAD to do what it did to stop the brain drain, sponsors leaving and just save McLaren in short term.  Renault is a band-aid until something better comes along.
I got a 32g iPhone 7 black replaced by Apple around 15 days back (so yeah obviously mint condition) , it has a tempered glass edge to edge protector on it.
Lol i remember saying this too and got downvoted into oblivion.
>I think he was shown 25 million numbers

Actually it was 40mil. but yea lol.
>But how did he get to know 19th before he retired? He was running in 5th and then pit because of flat spots caused by...something.

He spinned IIRC
He retired because of steering issues.
> MGU-K.

MGU-H. MGU-K is dependent on braking.
It was a 120mil contract but yea.
>  once moving to the Size 0 after being asked to

Misconception that gets spewed here all the time. Here is Arai's answer to that the size-zero BS.


https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Honda-s-F1-boss-opens-up-about-team-s-rough-year?page=2

 Some analysts say that the technological troubles you encountered stemmed from McLaren's "size zero" concept, which called for an extremely small power unit. Do you intend to make any size changes in 2016? 

 
A: No. F1 cars cannot go fast without proper consideration given to air resistance and the way suspensions move. It's important to minimize the size of power units so that they don't interfere with the car's design. ... McLaren once told us that we don't have to be aggressive in downsizing our power unit. But we are determined to shrink the size by whatever means possible.
>Hope they can battle Red Bulls right away

It's too much to ask for. Red Bull has been with Renault for over a decade now, they know how Renault works and what requirements the PU has . McLaren on the other hand would still need to get to know the Renault PU, integrate it with their chassis and revamp their entire back end .
>But the power gap (in % compared to mercedes) has halved in 2017 season so far.


We dont have the numbers . Honda has not brought a big update but a lot of small ones but "halved"? Nah.
>Do you think Nico was a more intense rival than Seb?

I would say yes. Nico got under Lewis' skin. Seb didnt .
>I have a feeling that honda is turning it around now

Grid penalties at Japan.

Grid penalties at COTA.

Grid penalties at Mexico.


The feeling you have is because in last 3 races McLaren has brought new suspension parts,new bargeboards,new FW that has helped their chassis immensely.
>So, I’ve been toying with this idea for a while. What if for the 2021 “engine update” the cars would have two electric motors powering the front wheels

It has been rumored since a long time. You didnt come up with it :P
> I think he is the worst driver on the grid, but he is decent. 

His gap to Wehrlein is 0.04%. 2nd smallest on the grid in quali. If that is the worst driver's gap to WEH, how bad is Wehrlein then? For reference Hulk was 0.9% ahead of palmar ie 30 times bigger gap.
> Call 1-888-bestbuy. 

Would chatting with someone be the same? I chatted with a guy and he said to talk to the store. :|

Anyway I will give them a call in the morning :)


Well Alonso himself said he braked late to defend. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  . I mean the guy driving the car would know more than me and you, no?
Yes!

Ordered online and then picked up instore.
>Yea sorry, likely the tag just didn't get on it before you bought it and we didn't notice at the register, easy fix, sorry about the time wasted

I just dont want to go there and then they ask me to return it and rebuy it only for it to scan a higher price because the store is kinda far away :( Let's see what I do. Thank you so much :D 
They asked me to bring it to the store which is like 30mins away and now i m confused if I should drive an hour to save $50 lol.
Alright :D


If that doesnt work out, I have a bestbuy 5mins from my place but i didnt pick the computer from there, should I just go to that bestbuy and talk to them or driving to the one I picked up would be better?
