I've been wondering the the same thing because I haven't seen the flash go off even when cars are definitely going after red.
The reason it doesn't add up is because as much as you think you know, you're not an expert, it's still not enough to claim you no more then the experts who published peer-reviewed studies about the World Trade Center collapse.
> The US have staged attacks on their own military before in order to start a war.


The World Trade Center was not the military. You have a very strange view of humanity if you think that our government would purposely kill thousands of their own citizens just to start a war. You do realize how crazy that sounds, no? That's why it's easy to dismiss out of hand.
For this petition what are the rules to determine who is or who is not an architect? Is this like some of the climate science deniers petitions where all you need is a Bachelors of Science to be considered a scientist?  The whole crux of the 9/11 conspiracy is that fire can't melt steel beams, which is false, secondly it didn't need to melt it completely it just needs to weaken it.
Seriously. If you're going to use the road, follow the rules, if you don't like the rules change them. Bitching about getting a ticket because you rode against traffic will change nothing.

We were talking about TMZ and this subreddit is nothing like TMZ.
They are and everything except vanilla reddit as far as I know. I use Reddit Sync on my phone and the RES extension on my PC.

If you add another layer to this it becomes even more fair. 


I tend bar and you always end up with a mishmash of large and small bills at the end of the night. Not everybody can get the larger bills so I will divide up the money evenly then put it behind my back and tell them to pick left or right. 

Sometimes you end up with mostly hundreds and fifties other times you'll get twenties and tens.
> If you hit someone on foot and they are jaywalking or whatever in my state you can be charged with dangerous driving instead of failure to yield.

That's only if they find that you were speeding or distracted. Outside of crosswalks pedestrians have to yield right-of-way to vehicles.
Yeah but the traffic signal was green, giving the cars the right of way. You can't have a green traffic signal for cars and pedestrians having right of way.  That's basically telling them that they both have the right of way and if that's the case then pedestrians will be getting run over left and right.
I feel like we agree on many points concerning this issue and conversation is always great.

Increased prescriptions for opioids definitely lead to the crisis that were in today and reducing those will definitely help as well

Trying to get people to avoid drugs is great in theory but I'm not sure how well it would work in practice. In one way it's already been tried with the Dare program and that is largely looked upon as a joke.  

I totally agree in increased education. Educating people is always the answer. Give people real information with the rates of addiction and what these drugs might do to you. Drugs like heroin are so frightening that their reality does not need to be exaggerated.

I've been around a lot of addiction in my life and the best way for me to describe my view is that I see addiction as a disease. Now, you wouldn't go locking up AIDS or cancer patients, would you?  

Make street drugs illegal and let the government regulate it. The only legal way you can get those drugs is through a treatment center. Selling the drug is illegal but possessing "personal amounts"  is not.
 
You create a government-funded road out of addiction.
If you consider the stoned ape theory possible then these deer are the next ones in line for becoming highly evolved like humans.
I mean anyone can make up a language. It doesn't have to be ASL for it to be an actual sign language. Assign meaning to a few dozen hand gestures and there you go, you can communicate.
He's well-known but it's not quite an A-list celebrity so he is in that point of his career where it makes the most sense to do these kind of movies. He is definitely a very good actor, seems to have a good head on his shoulders and overall seems like a very nice guy so I wish him the best of luck in the future.
I feel like you're missing the point. Over the last 60 plus years I think we've proven that locking up addicts doesn't solve the problem. If anything, it exasperates it. 

In places where they have decriminalized drugs they also have programs to help addicts. We just throw them in jail or prison where they can still get drugs. We offer no support when they are released, and addicts with no support relapse. 

It's definitely time to try a new approach because the War on Drugs has been an abject failure.
You apparently have never had to speak or make prepared remarks in front of a large group of people. 99.99% of the time you'll have notes.

Yeah but a lot of them are. I was talking about The Walking Dead and Fear The Walking Dead to a trump voter the other day. Says he still likes Walking Dead, I said that I haven't liked it for a few seasons but the new Fear has been pretty good.

He claimed that Fear The Walking Dead was a liberal propaganda machine. The son drug addict being a main character and the Multicultural, and  multi-ethnic cast is being pushed upon us to normalize these things.

Florida has two seasons, wet and dry. I've only seen it done occasionally but they did do it last year when we went through a particularly dry period after hurricane irma.
Where did I say that I don't think that they ever do that?  For my personal business, photography, the worst thing you could do would be to over-promise and under-deliver. 

The point of my comment was that Cambridge analytica is saying they can do all of these crazy things only to backtrack and say it was just a sales pitch. Anyone that has watched the undercover videos can call that bullshit out quite easily.

They do that occasionally in the dry season where I live in Florida to help prevent fires.

I'm a white knight for not date raping a girl? 

Rethink your life.
I didn't get her drunk at my bar, if you would have read anything I wrote you see that we all went back to their vacation rental.  That was also after we went to a few bars.
No, not my style. I just know that she's not going to be the last beautiful girl that I interact with. So there's no reason to fuck her while she's half-asleep. 

 You sound a little thirsty if you think there's something wrong with that.
Last summer I met this beautiful South African girl on vacation, we ended up with some friends back at there vacation rental. Fooled around a little,  she had said a few times during the night that she wanted to hook up,  everyone was really drunk and she was passing out towards the end of the night.  She was so drunk that I did not feel comfortable having sex with her, so I decided it was better to just let her pass out.  So I did and we slept, the next day they left.  The next day she actually text me and was a little embarrassed because she couldn't remember if we had sex or not.  I explained that we didn't because we were both so drunk and passing out.


I knew it was probably going to be the only chance I had to  consummate  and I would have loved to, but only if she was an active participant.


Edit just to add that this also wasn't a one-night stand in a traditional sense, I'm a bartender and they had come into my bar a few times on vacation. So I had also made her some drinks that night too so I knew she was pretty drunk.
The rider only had three seconds to get out of the way. It would take at least one second to realize what was going on, then you can see the rider think about moving but decide it's safer to just get out of the way.
Yeah, how is this any different from donating a kidney? It almost seems unbelievable that I am not allowed to choose who receives my bone marrow transplant assuming we're compatible.

>Also you would probably end up paying more for your food and drinks anyway because that's how they would pay the cost of wage increases by increasing what they charge you directly.

>That is empirically false. You wouldn't pay any more than the same you already have to with tipping at most.

Nah, he said it's false that you wouldn't pay any more than now for menu items.  You have to look at what he said in context to my quote. In my quote I said you would pay more for food and drinks, menu items, the only thing bars and restaurants sell people. 

I never said anything about paying more total, I said they would raise the price of the goods they sell.
> If the total charge is only either the same or less - *you're not paying more for your food and drinks.*


That is actually what he said. Did you just reply to me to agree with me, because you literally just said the same thing I did but used 57 instead of 49...

You'd be paying more for menu items in a tipless system.
I'm beginning to wonder if you even understand basic math. 


Restaurant has $47 Redfish, decides to go tipless, raises the price of Redfish to $49. 

You just paid more for you're food. 

What is so hard about that to understand?
If you're at a bar or restaurant what are you going to pay more for besides the food and drinks? What other prices can they raise besides food and drinks?  One more time, the two articles you cited said the exact same thing that I did, the restaurants in went tipless raised the cost of their food and drinks, **or** added service charge. 

One way or another the price is going to go back up to whatever it is you pay right now. Customers aren't going to save any money if we go tipless.
Reading comprehension my friend. I didn't say you would pay more than you would right now, I simply said that you would pay more for menu items and then you went on to cite two articles that mention the exact same thing.  I also said in my first paragraph as someone who works in the industry I would not like to see the change either because I make a lot of money the way it is right now. There is no profession in the world where someone would willingly fight to have their wages decreased.
The thing is that those of us in the industry that make good pay really don't want this to ever happen. I averaged between 20 and $25 an hour, sometimes higher.  Made $800 bartendering one New Year Eve so that was $100 an hour. No restaurant on Earth is going to pay all of their bartenders 20 plus dollars an hour.


Also you would probably end up paying more for your food and drinks anyway because that's how they would pay the cost of wage increases by increasing what they charge you directly.

Talking about the past is how we understand how to change the future, so you're dead wrong about that. Aside from all that I think it's just wrong of you to shout down someone because he expressed a truthful opinion.  In the end, we are on the same team so I understand your point of not helping the other team score. I just think there has to be a better way.
Have you ever stopped to think that you lashing out and claiming everyone that has a different opinion than you is Russian is exactly what Putin and his propagandists want? They want you to distrust your fellow Americans. You're basically throwing gasoline on that fire.
You need to accept the truth. He wasn't repeating Russian talking points he was repeating the truth. It sucks that  the American government done some shity things but you can't pretend it didn't happen just because it's inconvenient for you.
The executive office has too much power and as much as I think Obama was a great president, like all presidents he had his flaws and he did expand that power. He and others never expected a person like Donald Trump to come along and win the presidency.
This is what drives a lot of the Republican hypocrisy. They believe that everyone else is doing the shity things that they do.

2000 was the first time my brother and I were able to vote.  My mother and myself both voted for Al Gore, my father and my younger brother both voted third party.

Years later, after the destruction of the Bush presidency, both refuse to vote third party ever again, especially if someone like Donald Trump is the Republican candidate. There is too much at stake.

I didn't like either candidate. But I voted for Hillary because I could see what Donald Trump is, an impending disaster just like Bush was. It would definitely be better if Hillary Clinton were president. That is something you could only deny if you are being disingenuous.

You're reaching.  Not even close to the LeBron play.  The ball was on his left side when he pulled the behind the back despite the fact that you keep saying otherwise.
No man you have your interpretation of their rules and the NBA has the actual interpretation of their rules. In the NBA that's not a carry. That is a normal behind the back dribble that you see dozens of times in every single game.  If you could provide some proof other than a no name coach on YouTube I would be dumbfounded, one case of an NBA or college ref calling that a carry, please.
Bro, that's for Highschool, if you are fan of basketball you know that they call things differently in high school, college and the NBA. Even if it were a tightly refed Highschool game that's not a carry. Again if you watch it in slow motion his hand never goes under the ball it is always on the side or on the top, he also does not hang the ball out to the side. The only time that might have called that a carry back in the 50s and 60s.  Hell, they won't even call it a carry in today's high school games. So as a long-time fan who watches couple hundred games a year, and you're the only person calling something like this a carry, I'm pretty sure that you're wrong.
Watch it again in slow motion his hand does not go under the ball. He also starts to dribble on his left side and throws it behind his back to his right. I've been playing basketball for almost 30 years, since I was 7.  You're misinformed and there's nothing you can do to change the facts.
I got about 10 hours flying in Battlefield 1, think I can transfer that over?
I saw your reply but now it's gone. Maybe it's time you read the rules because that is not a carry at all. If you could explain to me why you think it is a carry I'll be more than happy to explain to you why it is not. If that's a carry than every behind the back dribble is also a carry...
I know this is like 12 days old but it's a pet peeve of mine. This wasn't a carry, a self pass, nothing, there was nothing illegal about this play in basketball. It's a behind-the-back dribble and nothing more. A self pass is when you throw it up in the air and catch it yourself without anyone else touching it. A carry is when you put your hand underneath the ball, which he clearly did not do.
That's if we win. Who's to say that all of this doesn't lead America down the wrong path?
It's most definitely Africa.  Give it 50 years and it' could be as developed as much as China.
Craig Mack was never known to be into drugs and when he finally left the music industry he became a pastor.  Spreading rumors like that about someone who has died is not cool.
Work on your grip strength and try palming the ball all the time.  I have normal sized hands but I can palm a ball like that in my right hand because I can squeeze the shit out of it but not my left.

I was in the exact same boat as you. I viewed Trump as Hillary's Kryptonite. I replied to a comment above saying the only way Hillary would win is if Bernie was her VP, or if Bernie had  won the nomination we wouldn't have Trump right now. The fact that the polls kept saying there was no chance she could lose reminded me of 2000 way too much. No one thought Bush was going to win in 2000, just like with Trump they laughed it off.
Hillary picking Bernie Sanders as her VP was the only way she was going to win.


Edit - For those few quick downvotes, she lost, so it's pretty clear her strategy did not work. Russian meddling did happen, but if Bernie had been on her ticket it would have been much more ineffectual.
Jokes are very easy to recognize, if they're funny.
If we're being honest, I would love to see a source for that claim.
The article even quotes an official Blizzard statement then goes on to state our sources said so.

> But then, after hours of fan excitement, an official response emerged from within Blizzard apparently designed to dampen down the flames: "As of now, we do not have any current plans to announce Diablo for Switch," a spokesperson told us.
Honest question, what does knowing the settings do for you?
I picked up photography about 12 years ago and over the last two years I've been trying to move to photography as my only gig.  I've shot a few weddings, but most of the things I've been paid for have been headshots or portraits. I also love shooting landscapes and cityscapes.

Knowing the setting someone shot at really isn't important. Unless you're in the studio no two scenes are going to have the same lighting, even then, if you normally shoot in a small studio and then work and a larger one you're going to have to adjust your settings.
Only for this year.

Dame is a star but Simmons is going to be a superstar.
Thought I heard about some recent studies that show that people are staying married more often than in the past.
I know a man who was the CEO of one of the largest banks in the United Kingdom. He started out as a bank teller 40 years ago, while going to University for finance of course.
The OP in this chain is referring to Boston.
Why? We have Simmons and Embiid together right now and Simmons ceiling is higher than Lillard's.
Boston doesn't need a ball handler.
81 games is nothing when you compare it to actual injury-prone players like Joel Embiid and Derrick Rose.
Thought I heard that Boston prepared trade packages for Kawhi and Anthony Davis this offseason. More than likely at least one of those players will have to be included in a trade for either of those.

I would guess the last line... But there's nothing unexpected about the prior two lines, so you got me.
Actually, that's exactly how it's supposed to work. Whining about reposts actually does nothing, using the downvote button  actually does something.
And if those checks and balances are ignored?

Edit - I never understand why I always see downvotes for legitimate questions.
How did you wait until she was your wife to show her Reddit?
It does imply that but it does not exclude other explanations for having seen a repost.

👍
That's what the downvote button is for.
Calling out reposts is a great way to let everyone know you spend too much time on Reddit.

I haven't seen this so I don't give a shit if it's a repost.
George, is that you?

So edgy.
Exactly my point one? One stride behind for an athlete from 70 ago just proves that we haven't improved as much as some people would like to think. Almost every generation has an athlete that is such an outlier, like Jesse Owens or Usain Bolt, that they would be competitive in almost any era. One argument you could make an argument that on average Humanity has become better athletes.
There was a concerted effort a some years ago for everyone to use "climate change" as the correct terminology because it is a better descriptive term than "global warming" to explain what is happening.

I have a question for you. 

Why would private Russian citizens, on their own accord, start these troll farms and other manipulations?
Exercise will help make your heart strong but if you eat nothing but fatty foods you will end up clogging arteries. Eating healthy is much more important than the amount of exercise you get.

Ignorant, naive or disingenuous. Hell, maybe you're all three.


Right now we're going through the 6th great Extinction. Species are going extinct at rates we've never experienced before and it's the result of human activity. 

Humans are responsible for the extinction of the white rhino, they were doing fine until we came along and started massacring them for their horns.
Global warming isn't a thing, but climate change is.

Edit - This is what is wrong with Reddit. A legitimate question is downvoted without reason, reply or response.
People have had Obamacare for long enough that they will notice when it is gone. One side is pushing to kill it and the other will reply by pushing the boundaries even farther. What Republicans fail to understand is that the majority of people want the government in healthcare. The free market failed the healthcare industry and the American people, now it needs to be regulated so that it benefits all.

There will always be flops. If you look back before 1 and done there weren't any more flops than today. Teams will still be cautious, hell Kobe came straight out of high-school and he wasn't drafted until the 13th pick.
It's more like a fact because one of the victims had excessive beard growth from the time he was last seen.
What OP is referring to is the traffic theory that when you widen roads, traffic increases to match the capacity of that road. Thus you're right back to where you started with the same level of congestion. 

This is why Miami needs better public transportation.
We recently got one in Sarasota. With large portion of our population being tourists, snowbirds or geriatrics, it is almost idiot proof. It is amazing how well the traffic runs through the interchange that it replaced.
Sorry but, Uber is banking on driverless cars. They bought 24,000 cars from Volvo to start a driverless car fleet hoping to be operational by 2021 at the latest. Fares are *actually* going to get cheaper.

His injury, quadriceps tendinopathy, can take up to 6 months to heal. Apparently it has been chronic for a number of years so that will increase the time it takes to heal. 

I suffered from tendinopathy in my achilles and in my elbow, I can tell you from first-hand experience that they are a bitch to rehab.

There's always a way. 

I'm from Florida. I've lived in New York City and in St Petersburg Russia, 3 years ago I moved to New York because I was offered a job and told I had to be there in a week. Slept on a friend's floor for a month and ended up living there for a year and a half. 

I had a Russian girlfriend here in the states and she was going back to St Petersburg, so I went with and basically lived off of my savings for 6 months because in 2006 it was incredibly cheap in Russia and used that as a home base to travel around Scandinavia.

I've done quite a few road trips up and down the East Coast and I take day trips all the time around Florida. 

One of my best friends is Peruvian and he has given me the opportunity to stay with some friends and family down there and that will be my next trip. 

There are multiple ways to reach your goal you just have to be willing to take the risk.

I'm not rich, the most I've made in a year is maybe 50k. It's about priorities. Is it important to you?
The thing about seat belts is that if there are other people in the car and you are not wearing a seatbelt you will injure them with your flying body.
Personally I think it will be closer to 10 years. Right now there is a lot of work going on for converting cars to self-driving and that technology will change the game.
90s fashion is everywhere right now. I'm in my mid-30s and I see teenagers and 20-somethings wearing Nirvana and Soundgarden t-shirts everywhere. Flannels, Doc Martens, tie-dye it's everywhere.
Might as well start considering them a new category. Like, tshirt, dress, pants, socks or shoes. Leggings are not going anywhere.
The way the world is going they're going to have a lot to look back on and say

No because most people say things and don't do them. If you **want** to travel you have to save money and find time. If it is truly important to you, you will make it a priority.
When you travel, the moment you leave home all of your routines are completely thrown out the window and you have to accept whatever life presents you with. Not only will you have to be okay with the stress of sometimes not knowing where you'll sleep or eat tomorrow or even how you'll get there, but you have to embrace that.

Seriously, if they're doing a Time jump they have so many loose ends to tie up. Doing a time jump sounds almost implausible considering how the story had been going. Just hearing this makes me a little sad because at least I had Fear to look forward to.

Have you ever worked in Hospitality or the food service industry?
Yeah, sounds like it was a late customer and they complained about their food for a refund, the food was thrown away and the refund was given but it's seems like the person recording wanted to keep the food.
I definitely get the vibe that the person recording is more at wrong than the girl being recorded.
What's the big deal? Republicans showed us that it's okay to just wait until the next president is elected so he can choose a Supreme Court Justice. Since they did it, I'm sure they'll be okay with us doing it too.

I would say the Jordan is the GOAT, I grew up watching him. But by now with LeBron I would never say that he is definitely not the GOAT. He's the only player since Jordan that you can legitimately say could become the greatest of all time.
6ft here, hand strength helps also. I can palm a ball with my right hand but not with my left because I can just grip that much harder with my right.
So basically a bunch of trolls started T_D. Yeah we know.
To be clear I would not necessarily say Putin is or ever was actually a communist. His concern is power and how to acquire, he doesn't care what system the government uses as long as he's in control.
These are for known Reserves. It doesn't actually represent how much of these we have left, it represents how much we know we have left and chances are for every single one of these we have much much more.
It is exactly "communist revenge".  Watch the Frontline episode Putin's Revenge. The United States had a major role in the downfall of the Soviet Union and he still harbors resentment over it.
Putin was in the KGB when the USSR fell and he supposedly still harbors a great deal of anger about the United States role in it.
Just checked their summer temperatures and it ranges from the mid-60s to the low 80s.  Humidity looks to be in the low 70s on average.

Word of advice, don't talk about this at work. 

Work is work and you don't need to bring politics into work, ever. All it will do is hurt you if you talk about these things at work.
Okay that's fair, but this is Shaq's reply to any challenge of him.
One is just a guess for fun, the other is commenting on something that is claimed to actually have happened. And those situations it's not uncommon or offencive to ask for sources.


Despite what you seem to think there is a difference.
> Working out non-stop like Kobe could have just ended in injury

These are professional trainers at the highest level, if anything it would have made him less injury-prone.
I still remember Stan Van Gundy making the horrible coaching decision of starting a recently recovered Jameer Nelson when Rafer Alston was killing it.
Never ever going to happen in a trillion years.  No way the NBA gives up that money.

I mean, he still is a bully. Shaq is great but he comes off so childish sometimes.
Yeah I just leave too. If a store assumes I'm stealing then they don't deserve my business.
I won't even shop in a store that makes you leave your backpack up front while I see women walking around with giant purses that are basically exactly the same thing.

Read the article. 

When you don't and then you make comments like this you just show everyone that you're fucking illiterate.
I saw this article on Facebook first and 90% of the people who commented didn't read the article just like you.


People, I expect better than Facebook level comments here on Reddit.
It's not a scientific metric but, here in Sarasota the Good signs outnumbered the Buchanan signs by 2 to 1 at least. I know a few people that work for the Democratic party here in Sarasota and virtually all of them thought that good was a lock to win despite poll numbers showing a statistical dead-heat. 

Most of the people on the ground here in Sarasota did not think Buchanan was going to win. Not just Democrats, but Republicans too. All those things you mentioned sound good on paper but they don't represent real life.
Sarasota is rich as fuck.
James Buchanan was not a strong Republican candidate. His father Vern Buchanan is a stronger candidate but most voters here in Sarasota are fed up with him and wanted nothing to do with his son either.
I do think you're right, the voters definitely resemble that. Members of the party seem to know full and well what is going on, so they are more complicit.
You do realize how easily the symbolism of this could be misconstrued?
Pretty sure the person you are replying to is a *person* and not a targeted ad system.
> I don't think the underlying fact should be ignored: **the Republican party is attempting to silence its opponents by charging them with crimes**.


I also don't think it should be ignored that the Republican voters are ~~party is~~  doing this because they feel like the Democratic party is doing it to them.  

They feel like the indictments against the Trump Administration are political gamesmanship instead of concerned Americans worried about the future of their country.
I've met quite a few full grown adults that look just like this. So to me these aren't *clearly* high school kids.

If regardless means "not showing attention" does irregardless mean "not showing attention to not showing attention"?

No I didn't. I simply stated my approximate costs.

> You realize everyones price is different right?

Of course. I was only replying to you. Again quit trying to make assumptions.

As for the rest, I don't care, this is pointless. I'm going to go jerk off, this is Reddit of course.
> You can afford 10k a year

It's not even close to 10 grand a year. Try more like 2k with a 4k deductible. 

>  but can't afford a few hundred dollars out of pocket for preventative care? 

You're making assumptions. Your whole post is making assumptions so it makes you look like an ass. All of that is besides the point because we're not talking about preventative care, that's not what causes people to go bankrupt. The overwhelming majority of people cannot afford a catastrophic health care bill. When those people can't pay those bills that's what causes rates to go up. If we had a system where it was virtually guaranteed that bills would be paid rates would go down. That's the whole point of single-payer.

> medical bills are only high because of the government. 

Wrong. Try again. Medical bills in the United States were higher then most of the other countries in the developed world before the government got involved with Obamacare.
He thinks he's the next Allen Iverson and he is nowhere close to that. Put him in the right system and he'll do good but he was definitely not the right fit on the Cavs.
> Paying cash is significantly cheaper than buying health insurance.

Sure that's great if it's true, but since only 1% of population can realistically afford to pay for significant medical bills go, fuck yourself.
IT has ruined his value so much this year when I'm sure he was explicitly trying to do the opposite.

If they had a lens with the equivalent focal length of these three shots put together it would not affect the perspective as long as they were at the correct distance.
Totally different scenarios. Jordans father had just been murdered and he and the bulls just completed their first 3peat. OP was suggesting LeBron sit out like a LeBitch.
Doctors, movie stars, and car salesmen are three terrible examples. You just named three professions where payment is rarely between the consumer and the seller directly.

Doctors are paid by their hospitals and health insurance, movie stars are paid by movie studios, and car salesman make commissions based off of the sale through the loan purchasing the car. Very rarely does someone breaking out a debit card to swipe and make payment with any of those three.
No, I just think that most of us that making a good wage in the service industry realize that it would be financially impossible for us to be paid that by a restaurant. As a bartender on a slow to average Saturday night last night I made 33 dollars an hour and was home at 11. 

Making 45-50k a year and mostly working part time does not seem less than human to me at all.
Go get a buddy and have him try to block you from behind while shooting a jump shot.
I've been working the restaurant industry for about 10 years, I and many other people in the hospitality industry actually don't want to change the system because I make about 25 to $30 an hour.  Very few restaurants would be willing to match that wage.
Well, they continued the custom of tipping because everyone found out there Uber drivers make complete shit.

Welcome To Earth 2018.
You're very good at projection.
If you're going to thank anyone for that you should really be thanking George W. Bush. Blows my mind how you people keep blaming Obama for what Bush did to this country.
Not seeing where they are attributing this to David Duke. 

The headline itself says Duke is praising Trump.
An amazing thing I've noticed is a lot of people that have this train of thought, talking about illegal immigrants driving down wages, is that many times they also oppose raising minimum wage.
To me it sounded like people would get take out, then go sit out on the front patio thus taking tables away from servers the and the restaurant.
> And yet for some people being in a new place filled with strangers seems to be the cue to forget every bit of manners and polite public behavior their mother ever taught them.


You're giving them too much credit my friend, most of the time these kind of people are assholes all of the time.
Why are people discount in the influx of Latinos to Texas when they normally identify as Democrats?
Good seeing that more Americans are registered Democrats than Republicans then.
Florida, please make me proud.
There are a bevy of reasons. Low taxes, no state income tax, lots of corruption. Most of it is produced in Miami, and Miami is a hell hole.

A lot of the discontent among Trump supporters has to do with the fact that places like New York, LA and other metropolitan cities are wealthy and successful while Middle America is poor and destitute.

There already are some but in the future there will be more stores that don't even have a checkout lane you put the items in your cart scan them as you go.
> I disagree, we can decide as a society to boycott these machines.

Not gonna happen, there is near zero interest in actually stopping it outside of a few crazy people yelling in the store at 11 at night. There is way too much money to be made,, you can't stop it. Nothing you could have done would have stopped the Industrial Revolution and nothing you could do will stop the robotic/automation revolution.
I'm not in AA but I can understand where the other poster is coming from. I don't believe in God, I'm not religious in the slightest but I do meditate daily and the concept of a higher power is still an easy one to understand. When I think of a high-power I think of the universe in general, which the other poster might do as well. If you can look out into the universe and not think there is some crazy things out there then you might be looking in the wrong direction.
A downvote and smart-ass comment for someone just trying to help? Cool.
Relax? Nothing in my post indicates that I'm not relaxed. This sub is terrible and you can't deny that.
I don't understand how they think that they will affect change if they don't change who's in charge of the government also.
Upvotes aren't an indicator of raw upvotes, they are the accumulation of up and down vote points. So that means at the time of your post, likely more than 11,000 people had upvoted this.
I've taken the Automod as making fun of the idiots who post things where there is clear reason why they are filming. So most posts on this sub.
This sub is fucking stupid. It's pretty clear why they were filming in most of these posts...

Because they wanted shity content of cats doing cat things.

This is highly debatable.

I had been hate watching it like a train wreck but I can't even do that anymore.

Tbh, I don't think many westerners think Russians are uneducated. For a long time Russia has had one of the higher rates of college or university graduates. 

Drunk, sure some. I know alcoholism is a problem in Russia.

And hard-working? That's a great stereotype to have.

Even with the Republicans refusing to work with him and filibustering many attempts he got a lot done. 


He was one of the best presidents we've had in the last 50 years.  Definitely better than Trump, definitely better than both Bush's, Clinton, Reagan, Carter, Nixon, Ford and Johnson. But just like all of those President Obama was not without his faults. History will look kindly upon him because of the lack of controversies, the class that he held in office, and being the first black president.
And stable, don't forget stable.
That's something you have control over, friend. You don't *have* to get upset, ultimately you are responsible for how you react to situations.

Maybe to Canada, but these people coming from Central and South America don't have many other options besides the United States.
You are assuming that people worship Obama in the same way they do Trump.  The difference is Obama actually did do good and great things that are worthy of admiration. He also did things that are worthy of criticism.

I voted for Obama twice and I am highly critical of him like many other thoughtful people who care about politics. Just because I think he was a great president doesn't mean that I do not realize his faults, which he, every President and every person on this Earth have.
> People come to the US for the jobs, full stop.

You should not deal in absolutes with things that cannot be absolute. It was just mentioned above some other reasons why people would flee their homes in Central and South America. Jobs are just one of the reasons.
True. 


But it also happened under other Presidents so what kind of idiotic point are you trying to make?
The video says it would have taken 5 to 6 minutes for the lifeguards to reach them.
The accompanying video says I took the drone 70 seconds to reach the pair and it would have taken lifeguards 5 to 6 minutes to swim to them.

So you're suggesting that the lifeguards were in the parking lot? Doesn't make much sense man.

Well ok, we can go back to the 80s and 90s with the controversies involving the properties he owned and who he rented to and that he said that the Central Park five should be hung even though DNA evidence exonerated them completely. I don't think these are really new territories for Donald Trump.
Why do you think that?  Considering that she played in a guitar based rock band and play guitar herself it seems more than appropriate.
Tbf it does seem like a lot of celebrities died in 2017. I'm sure that's what the other poster is referring to.
I'm not sure who is teaching you these things but a typical person is built to live to around 70 plus years old. The key to living a long life thousands of years ago was simply to make it out of childhood, the time when we are most vulnerable.  Life expectancy went up simply because we lowered infant mortality rates.

First off I know I have a big dick and I don't need to prove it or seek validation from others, unlike you. That's because I have confidence in myself and I don't need to rely on others to define my own self worth, again, unlike you. 


Lastly, no one has ever, in the history of Earth has appreciated an unsolicited dick pic you moron. Put your dick away unless someone asks to see it.
Well since you blocked the other guy I just like to chime in and say that basically everything he said was right and you are wrong. I played through the entire game but only a handful of times have I done multiplayer and this is pretty much how it looks when I play.
Same here.
Nah, this looks like me playing this game mode...

Don't be discouraged, the majority of Reddit are fourteen-year-old edgelords.
Says the guy that doesn't even believe this is happening.

I'd disagree that this is a benefit. Is the next Generation going to be awkward and unable to hold a decent conversation because they spend most of their lives not interacting with other people in a face-to-face environment?

Regardless of what happens we should probably take away some powers from the presidency.
This is something that so many people don't quite understand. Putin is still pissed off about the dissolution of the USSR and America's role in it. He would like nothing more than to see America disintegrate in the same way that they did.

The glutes respond very well to training and squats aren't even the best way to grow them.

Could be just me but it seems like there are more and more of these close calls lately. I can't remember where I heard it but there's supposed to be a hypothesis out there that we are going to be entering an area of the universe where we could expect more asteroid or Comet strikes and close calls.

Quite the leap you had to make there. I own my house, my own car, pay my own bills and this asshat is calling me a child on Christmas because my parents actually like me, which is clearly not the case for you. Probably why you seek approval by buying them overpriced gifts.
I'm 37 and my parents refuse to stop giving me gifts.

Nothing.

https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2017-01-17/obamas-covert-drone-war-in-numbers-ten-times-more-strikes-than-bush

> The White House released long-awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US’s estimate of the number of **civilians killed** – between 64 and 116 – contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at **380 to 801** was six times higher.


Let's not forget the only reason that we were even there is because George Bush lied to the American people. Your 30000 children remark is ridiculous.
You're also assuming that children haven't been killed in drone strikes that Trump has approved. Considering the nature of War that's highly unlikely to have not happened.

Again don't be ignorant.
Reddit is so reactionary, first off bro I'm not a goon. I misread someone's comment. Chill out Reddit.
No, it's called I misread the comment.
That's the best kind of correct.
So you're bragging about doing something that could potentially harm or kill others in driving drunk?
Go back 20 years, it's always how it's been done.
We have many, many, many accounts of Obama writing his own speeches. Of course he does not write them all, but don't pretend that he isn't any writing them.
I remember reading an article that pointed out that Trump would have made more money  if he had just put that million into savings account of some kind then what he did go on and do with it. Maybe you don't realize but in America the deck is stacked for the rich.
Trump is president and drone strikes are still going on, you're being ignorant.
It is a female voice in the video
He might want to seriously consider changing his shooting form.
Isn't his opponent ironstache though?
So their idea is to cut the American people's "allowance"? Basically our access to earned benefits like Social Security, healthcare, education, infrastructure.

Abs start showing for most people around 15%. Looking at pictures of LeBron he easily seems to be between 10 and 15% body fat. The lowest I would put him at is 10%.
At 8% body fat his lean body mass is about 240 or 245. That is  total body weight excluding fat, bones, organs, everything. Total muscle could be around 180lbs, maybe lower.
Think about someone with an average level of intelligence, then remember that half of all people are dumber than that.

[earthrise](https://goo.gl/images/sy8oeJ) and many other photos of the Earth have been taken in a single shot.

I think that means the opposite of what you actually think it means. 

Goods are more expensive to import into poor countries because of a lack of infrastructure. An iPad is much more expensive in Cuba than it is in the United States because of that.
This is a joke, right? This is not a good workout for anything.
In general when shooting portraits the nose and eyes should stay in focus and then then go blurry just past the eyes. 


Secondly, you may love this photo but there's no context for anyone else to look at it as anything important. You see a family pet that you probably love dearly, I see a random dog with nothing of real note in the photograph. Try to step back from the emotion that you feel about the photograph and ask yourself if anyone else would care.
The jump kicker was not the one about to hit the knocked out guy in the grey shirt. It was his friend in the black shirt.
Speak for yourself bud. I thought Trump was the only one that Hillary couldn't defeat. She was a terrible candidate, he was a terrible candidate, but he was also her Kryptonite.
First off, I'm not an asshole.  I didn't personally insult you,  so name calling isn't necessary. 

Just a tip turn off portrait mode or skin softening or whatever it is on your phone. Because it's turning a beautiful girl into a fake one. Sorry you took offense.
You literally showed us the same picture.

Either you have too much makeup on or the photo has been edited to shit by a program other than Photoshop. Your skin is so smooth that there are zero pores on your face, there's definitely some editing involved.  This wasn't supposed to be a knock on you, just something I wanted to point out so you knew that you might have gone too far in the editing.
Too much Photoshop.

No, they can't. Not yet at least. We are still years out from fully operational AI doctors, driverless cars and many other advancements. And just because those Evolutions are coming doesn't mean we should sit on our hands and do nothing, we have to prepare for the now and the future.

Great idea, let's close that loophole too. It's time for New Deal 2.0 tax rates.

I think you know that you're being completely disingenuous with that statement.
They say that is the dozens and dozens of smaller hits that add up and cause more damage then the times when a player gets speared.

I would say just keep bulking, as clean as you can, and keep strength training. It doesn't look like you have a lot of mass to work with right now so cutting down won't really do much for your physique.  

I understand being uncomfortable gaining weight because you have lost so much but I think now you understand how to gain or lose weight successfully and you won't become overweight again.
I've had a few of those conversations as well. I point out that Putin doesn't like America and is still pissed off about the fall of the Soviet Union and he blames us for that. Russian does not have our best interests in mind.
If they are alive they still have the opportunity to achieve freedom and clear their name. A life sentence is better than the death sentence in my mind.

Seriously man you should at least do the basic amount of research before you state something. A Google search for "wrongful execution in United States" yields many results. Not sure what studies you read but maybe you should link them.
Republicans are trying to push through a tax reform bill that will likely tank the economy in the coming years. Donald Trump wanted to call the bill "cut cut cut" because they are cutting so much funding.


Edit - thanks for the downvotes, I only stated the facts reported. Sorry you don't like facts.

Aren't we currently still in what many consider to be one of the strongest economic periods of our times? Stock market soaring, Bitcoin exploding, housing market still going up.

Loved that game. Played it from 1.0 to whatever is was a few years later.
No I see their point and understand that they're just ignorant people but being ignorant does not give you a pass. It takes all of 10 minutes to do research on Doug Jones to find out that he doesn't support full term abortions. In the end every person is responsible for the situation they are in, they could easily remedy that by educating themselves. 

Besides all of that Moore has admitted that he has had relationships with underage girls, with their mother's permission of course. That is a disqualifier in today's world and he should not be elected.

Even though I'm suffering through people who use roundabouts poorly.

I live in a city that has been adding roundabouts over the years and has a few more planned on major roadways. On top of that it is a big tourist destination in Florida and we have a lot of snow birds. Basically people that aren't familiar with our roads or shouldn't be driving.


I loved the idea beforehand, but now in practice I'm starting to lose my patience with these people who stop when no one is in the traffic circle.

Assuming it is a fisheye, at the 18 second mark you can see the car moving toward the HOV lane and the car he cut off is on his brakes as well, plus rider isn't grabbing the front brake until 3 seconds later basically the moment before impact. Aside from that, his spidey senses should have been tingling because he was approaching a group of slow moving cars where something like this is always bound to happen. 

The point is when you're riding a motorcycle you have to assume that no one sees you and everyone is out to kill you. This rider clearly does not follow those two rules.

I agree with that. Right now it is incredibly difficult for anyone to become a citizen, this is why we have so much illegal immigration. Give people an opportunity to do so and they will do it legally.
> classifying illegal immigration as a crime.

Isn't it a crime though? Shouldn't it be a crime?

I've been left-leaning my entire life and I believe the immigration needs reform to make it easier to become a citizen of the United States. But let's be real, it's a crime.
See that grinning monster in a human skin suit two places to Paul Ryan's right? That is Vern Buchanan my representative, he posted about this tax reform bill on Facebook today and the response was completely negative. They know the people don't want this and they don't give a shit.

Oh, you're joking? My mistake.

Unlike Trump supporters you won't find me defending Ted Kennedy for what he did.

As for as Bernie, that is a very weak statement, we live in a capitalist society and Bernie isn't a communist. Did you expect him to give his book away for free? That's fucking ridiculous.

Your thoughts are a representation of who you are. When you say batshit insane things people start to question the reliability of your character. 

Kyrie is an example of someone who should have been made go to college for eight years before he was allowed to play in the NBA.
Highly unlikely.  Just from what we know from the documents released Monday it looks very bad for the entire Trump Administration. Plus, what we know is only a small fraction of what the Mueller team knows.  I'm waiting for all the evidence to come out, but somehow you've already decided that Russia is just a deflection. Give it time, Mueller looks like he's many steps ahead of Trump right now.
Question for you. Why does this line of questioning even matter? They've got rockets and artillery pointed at Seoul and everyone there knows that if even only a small percentage hit their targets it would be devastation.

I always scroll to the bottom of the comments when these are posted to see who doesn't know jackshit about basketball.
Why is that?
I don't think many people expect the charges will be directly against Trump. I think most people believe this is being built like a case against organized crime, start indicting people and get them to flip.
Not really. The head of the FBI serves at the Leisure of the president.  Robert Mueller does not, Trump would have to jump through a few hoops to fire him.
"Let me just remind you to do something you and everyone else already does"
This is a shitpost, right?

Since that isn't going to happen we need to work on real solutions.
Could you imagine the conniption fit that trumpsters would have if a Jewish man was the one that flipped on Don to bring this whole thing down?
If Trump somehow fires Mueller on Monday morning it could be the biggest shitshow in America ever. It would be the Crown Jewel, the cherry on top for the Trump Administration.


Edit - I understand that it would be extremely difficult for Trump to fire Mueller, that's why I said "somehow".
Look in the mirror buddy you just describe Donald Trump too.  He's corrupt, a sexual assault braggart, a fat ass who's just as unhealthy in body as in mind.
Care to share how you came to that conclusion? Not an attack I'm just curious.
A belt might add 10 lb at most, there's really no ego involved because I don't ego lift, every rep is under control and with good form. I look at it as a tool to assist in my training, nothing else.  Plus I'm pushing 40, every added layer safety I can get I will take.
You said something terrifying has to happen. 1987 proves that that is untrue. Nothing terrifying happened in 1987 other than the train going off the rails.
Tactically speaking Russia is at huge disadvantage on the European Plain.  They will quickly end up in a bottle neck the further west they go. What Russia really wants is to regain control of former Soviet States through political means, propaganda and discourse.
Definitely not Russia. Russia currently has quite a few regions that would love to declare independence, if Putin backed Independence elsewhere they might try to see what they can get away with.
Absolutely nothing cause the crash in 1987. The train got out of control and they couldn't stop it, that could easily happen again.
Trump's lawyer is really named Ty Cobb? Like after the Hall of Fame baseball player and disputed racist Ty Cobb...

That's hilarious. 😂
This isn't the consequence of getting swole, it's a consequence of a poor trainer and poor form.
A dumbbell press doesn't really have much carry over for basketball.
Did you see what the trainer did after the first rep?

"Yeah that's it that's great"

That guy should not have that job.
How do I, just some random guy that likes to lift that has only put in basic amounts of research know how to perform this lift better than a so-called professional trainer for a multimillion-dollar sports team? 

No wonder his shoulder is hurt.
But if he just signed a new contract they cannot kill him off until the contract is up.
I'd believe all that if we had somebody else in the Oval Office. Nothing seems out of the realm of possibility anymore.
I can actually explain why this happened.

Let's say the waiter does accidentally add something and has a manager remove it. The item still shows up on the POS screen, but not on the printed receipt. I've seen this affect Auto gratuities as well.
You can split checks. 

The customer sees the bill with the soft drinks and pays that amount accordingly.

Split off the soft drinks and then cash out the check, start all over again with the next table.
Rick and Negan kissed and made up. Everything is cool now, they're going to be best friends, great finale.
Same as Jimmy Carter.
Not really. Once you get past the initial fear of taking to strangers in public is not so bad.
I think OP meant Zip2.
Worked for me and apparently many others, not bogus.
Wow, that is crazy. I grew up around Riverview High School and I've never heard of a rape occurring there.
I've been dealing with achilles tendonitis for about 3 years now. I basically had to stop playing basketball and stop running for the last 3 years to get to 95% recovered. When it was at its peak it was definitely the worst injury I've ever dealt with and I've been in a serious motorcycle accident. Every single step is a painful one.
Unfortunately Trump has done probably a dozen things since he became president that are unforgiveable.
I don't know, apparently the only thing Trump is actually good at is golf. What a sad fuck.
My max deadlift is around 425 at 200 lbs, not world-changing but I have put my time in. Regardless of whether you have used a belt or not, in the real world, eventually it doesn't matter because you've lifted enough. If you can deadlift 315 with a belt, you're stronger than most people and that definitely helps you in the real world. 


In the end if you want to pull real weight you should use a belt for safety if nothing else.
Then we create a real life human simulation VR where you can die of old age.

> If I agreed with them on what we were marching about, maybe.

Ok but in this particular incident the people marching were Nazis. Sure you can have the same opinion that the statues shouldn't come down, but Nazis want a very different thing than what the United States is about. 


> Many of the counter protestors at Charlottsville had Soviet flags. I dont think that makes all of the counter protesters Stalinists. Do you?

Honestly, I did not even know about that. Those people are just stupid as well. 

I lived in Russia for 6 months teaching ESOL.  I spoke with many Russians that lived though Stalin and the Soviet era and heard first-hand accounts of how terrible things were then. Anyone that pines for the days of Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany is delusional.
Would you march with a group you don't agree with?
If you march with Nazis what does that make you?
> Excuse me, excuse me. (inaudible) themselves (inaudible) and you have some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides. You had people in that group -- excuse me, excuse me -- I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.


http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-charlottesville-transcript-20170815-story.html

The people that were there to protest the taking down of a statue were fucking Nazis. A huge group of Nazis walked around with tiki torches, it was a planned march by a white supremacist group, then they drove a car into a group of people and killed one of them.  You can say one thing and then have it invalidated when you say something else which is exactly what Trump did. It what he always does. He's a con man and he talks out of both sides of his mouth.
Where are the people that were telling me that Melo would destroy KP one on one now?
> What presence and political backing do Nazis have in the US?

The President of the United States. Very fine people on both sides.
The Barbell deadlift is by far my favorite and best lift. (I know this is a kettlebell sub👍)


Ditch the belt, for now. Then get a sturdy leather one when you move up in weight. Another commenter said it'll make you weak which is just not true, it does help you lift more and it actually activates your core more because you're pushing out on the belt. That said, I still prefer to only use my belt for working weights not warm ups. 


 Someone else said "breath out" do not ever breath out during a deadlift. Breathe air into your belly and forcefully press out on the belt. This will keep you're core stable and spine neutral.


Also, slowly put down the weight and never drop it.


Squat looks good, can't tell what shoes you're using but as you move up in weight you might want to look into squat shoes.
I'll see if I can find it but there's actually studies out there that show that belts increase core activation when used right. Belts don't make you weaker, they make you stronger and when you move up in weight it makes it safer as well.
Technically yes, the legal limit is over served. If someone got in an accident with a BAC .09 and they killed someone, the bar and the bartender could be held liable.  There isn't a gray area when it comes to a DUI, how would there be a different standard for over serving?
Not how it works, they would subpoena the bill and any video footage that you might have. I'm a bartender, we are culpable if we over serve someone.
If it is somehow similar to what I have been dealing with (tennis elbow) it definitely messes with your shooting mechanics. It's a general discomfort in my shoulder and entire arm, it is a repetitive stress injury, it's not serious but it takes a long time to rehab and staying active is generally recommended. I don't think he would be out there if it was actually serious.
Exactly, I couldn't get into this show because of that.
I've been dealing with some arm and shoulder injuries for about 6 months. I have tennis elbow, and I have some impingement that has caused inflammation in my rotator cuff. You couldn't tell by watching me move but almost every motion is painful.
They did in my 3rd year myleague in 2k18. I guess that means it should happen soon in real life right?
Sure, perhaps during rush hour, but probably not, some people are not in a hurry and others are. Any other time stay out of the way.
Maybe you, but they couldn't and didn't ignore me. 

Two things I think help are really express that you are in a hurry (yell or raise voice) when you say that and be bigger than most people. 👍
What happens is I yell **stand on the right** as I'm going up or down the escalator if someone is in my way.

You're missing the point. 

2K has clearly increased the prices and increased the grind in an attempt to get people to buy more VC. Everyone is just pointing out that it's a bad joke considering the circumstances.
Yeah he said he would refund it to my wallet but I said that wasn't good enough, I'd like to return to my card. It's late and I'm just off work so I'm calling them tomorrow. 

It's not the first time I've had issues with the PSN. I've gotten my bank info hacked off of the PSN and had my account hijacked once as well.  With never being able to get streaming in a timely fashion I think it's time I take my card off the PSN permanently.
It's probably because he's an adult and he cares about how he spends his money and time. This is the absolute biggest money grab 2K has done yet, and that's saying a lot because they haven't ever shied away from microtransactions.
It's not very funny anymore, considering how this game is basically a $60 game that uses the free to play model it looks more like they're laughing at us instead of with us.
Thanks, I actually chatted with them but they'll only return it to my wallet, which I understand is standard operating procedure. Not good enough for me, I'm calling tomorrow to try and get it returned to my card.
From here on out, I will be. I'm done with the PSN. I could have pirated that an hour after it aired, instead 24 hours later I'm still waiting to watch something I actually paid for. The real kicker is that if I would have got it on Amazon I could have watched it by now.
Still nothing. Anyone know if I can refund this?

Kinda bullshit.

After last season I really have not been able to watch The Walking Dead. I saw the first episode this year and I think that's it. The way they left us on that ridiculous cliffhanger just pissed me off and made me not want to watch the show. So I watched the first episode just to find out what happened and I haven't watched since.

Edit - for clarification I do mean the Negan baseball bat scene
It takes dedication to watch 7 seasons of a pretty trash show.

But look at how far smartphones have come in 10 years. This is what is about to happen with automation.  Driverless cars and self-checkout are just the beginning.

Let me know when you find that magical wide-angle lens that can give Bokeh like that from that distance. The depth of field created in this picture is not possible unless you use the brenzinger method or software to create this depth of field.
No, that's a travel. The ball has to hit the backboard, the basket ring or another player otherwise it's a travel.

While Afghan Farmers having nothing more to farm than opium poppies did not help. The Opium epidemic started with pills in the late 90s and early 2000s. After we started cracking down on pill mills in the late aughts those addicted to pills moved to heroin.

By not doing it.
I worked at an Albertsons in the late 90s and early 2000s and started at $11 an hour. I worked there for about 5 years and when I left I was making $17 an hour as nothing more than basically a team lead. 

Wages have actually contracted, people used to be paid more than they are today.
I commented above about how I believe in the next five to ten years many of these people won't have jobs anyway because of automation. There will be more self checkout registers and fewer employees. That's why they'll be able to afford to pay $15 an hour and not hurt their bottom line.
I'm not sure why it matters at all when many target employees will be out of a job in the next five to 10 years when automation becomes more and more prevalent.
I mean it's a long shot, but I don't see why someone had to down vote you for that. 😂
Yes. The ball has to hit the backboard,  basket ring or another player.
In the real world it at least has to hit off of the backboard, basket ring or another player. If it does none of those things it is a self pass and you lose possession of the ball.
One pump fake and you probably would have made the shot.

I'm pretty sure we were not promised any DLC. I remember reading somewhere shortly after the release that they would only be updating online not offline.

FPL told us at the latest it will be September 22nd. I hadn't minded at first but it is getting a little frustrating considering the homebase all of the out-of-state workers is at our County Fairgrounds a half mile North while my neighbors across the street have power and Amish Town a half-mile East never lost power. 

I went 10 days without power for Charley, it's time to invest in a generator.
Tell me what bad predictions were made? The first NOAA prediction I saw that had Irma hitting the states hit it on the westside exactly where it landed.
Republicans saying they were small government used to mean something else than it does today. Today when they say they are small government they just mean that they are corporatists and there they want to give corporations and the rich even more tax breaks.
Burying your head in the sand is not a good strategy.  More people were kept safe because they took Irma seriously as they should have because it was a record-breaking storm.
I'm born and raised Floridian and I told everyone to not hold their breath. We could still have another active season like 2004 or 2005.

Find the storm surge map for your area, that is a good indicator if you can't find someone to check out the area in person. Many places in South Florida that are in Zone A and B will be flooded.
That YouTube channel is cancer.
I rent a two story house in zone C with bay windows across from a park.  Couldn't get wood so I'm not gonna ride it out there.  Parents are in a flood prone area of zone D so we're all cramming into a two-bedroom apartment. We're 3rd generation Floridians and none of us have ever seen anything like this.
We're gonna be in zone D in a 3rd floor concrete apartment. Hopefully that'll be enough.
I'm in Sarasota, south of Tampa.  We expect to get our first rain in the morning.
No, but I'm in Sarasota. I'll will tomorrow....
This isn't bigger than Sandy. What need it strange is how big it is with the winds it was packing. Andrew by comparison which was also an extremely powerful hurricane was smaller than Irma.

He got to go out there and be the center of the offense for 30 minutes, of course Manu loved it.
The storm surge will only really affect where the hurricane makes landfall. The storm itself is not dropping a lot of rain.
I've heard forecasters say it's a medium to large hurricane. Given its wind speed, it's size is a little out of the ordinary. Andrew was much smaller, it's hurricane force winds only stretched 30 miles I believe Irma's is out words of 100.
Isn't RDR 2 coming soon anyway?
I like that idea.
I'm born and raised in Florida. Someone posted a link to Charlie, I was in Sarasota when Charlie hit and we got 100 mile an hour plus winds, lost power for more than a week. Sarasota was fine, Orlando was fine. The Port Charlotte Area was not fine. 

Orlando is Inland so it is much more safe than being on the coast. They'll lose power at most and some flooding.  It's going to be like a very, very bad storm in Orlando, not a cat 5 hurricane with the eyewall passing overhead.
Nah fam, we good.

This wouldn't have happened to have been a few years ago up in a Cape Cod area would it? A friend of mine had the **exact** same thing happen to him.
My best friend died of a heroin overdose a little more than a year ago at 38. He was a Elementary school teacher and no one even knew that he had a problem. I think about him and miss him everyday.  You've got a chance that my friend never had, you have a chance to experience something so rare that you only get one of them and so fragile it could end at any moment. A life that is free of the chains of addiction. 

I know it's not easy. I've been there because I was/am an alcoholic and my life has gotten so much better since I stopped that I could never even imagine going back to the way I was, it was a terrible life.

Keep trying. One day all the pain and suffering will have been worth it.
That's fine, of course you can have your own opinion. But IMO judging and holding prejudices against people is nothing but a dead end street.  I look at how others treat me and other people,  not who they date. Everyone has their own fetishes and things they're attracted to.  What's normal to one person will seem strange, odd and send signals to others. 

You might think the sound of frogs is arousing and I would definitely think that is strange but I would not let that color how I think of you as a human being.

Whether you measure out 1 tablespoon, or just enough to coat the inside of the glass, vermouth is a key ingredient. Otherwise, it doesn't really qualify as a cocktail. 

I've been working in this industry for 10 years and bartending for half of it. In my experience, the vast majority do not want any vermouth in their martinis. People don't care if it's a cocktail or not, they just want to be able to look classy carrying around a large shot of vodka to drink from.

Depends on the quality of the source material. Broadcast television had terrible resolution and you can't really upres it that well.
The NFL films footage was actually shot on film, that's why I look so good. Unfortunately old broadcast television footage can't and won't ever look that good, unless there's some major technological developments. Like... **enhance**
Probably just your TV. There is no reason that would lose quality when converting into SD. The other reason that old broadcast footage looks terrible on HDTVs is because the HDTVs have a higher resolution, so you'll actually see more artifacts. So it might be a little bit of nostalgia kicking in for you thinking that the CRT TV had a clear and sharp picture when comparatively speaking, it really wasn't at all.

You could look at other subs that turned to shit when they took away the down vote. 

Politics is about discourse, talking to one another, and disagreements. Taking away the downvote does nothing but let Bots, shills and trolls run the show.  I personally think that this sub would be incredibly negatively affected by taking away downvotes, it's an opinion, not a fact.


Edit - got to thinking and I remembered digg.com, they removed downvotes and there was a mass exodus to Reddit because of it.
It only negatively affects those who don't know that you can bypass it, doesn't it? That's why it's pointless.  Anyone that wants to down vote will. Bots, people, assholes...  But casual Reddit users won't understand, at least at first.


Then anytime someone says "where's the downvote button?" someone will just reply "turn off subreddit styles" so again, it's pointless.
If downvotes were taken away permanently this sub would die.
Yes and if you turn off subreddit styles too. So in the end, it's pointless to take away the downvote because if someone really wants to they will downvote.
Seriously. This is a terrible idea for a political sub.
That article is why I'm asking. It's over a year old and one of the only times it's been mentioned in the news since then if I recall. 

The price has gone up a more than $10 to $15 a pack since then but no signs of the stock running out anytime soon.
Turn off "use subreddits style" and they'll come back. Mods decided to "experiment" with not having it. 

I think removing the downvote plays into exactly what T_D and Trump supporters in general think about /r/politics 

A bunch of liberals that get upset by downvotes and other opinions so much that they made /r/politics into a safespace. 

Plus it's easy to get around. So why? If someone really wants to downvote they will. It'll only affect the users that don't kow you can turn off subreddit styles or go on mobile.
And? Welcome to Reddit?

I fail to see why this an issue, but see a bigger one. 

If you remove downvotes then actual misinformation can't get buried. 
This should not be an "upvote only" community. Not only because that is a ridiculous idea at it's core for a political sub, but because on mobile it's easily bypassed.  
I know they said that they were going to discontinue this film a while back but that they still have plenty of back stock. I'm down to my last pack. Any idea when they will actually run out or is there any news on if they have decided to continue production?
Can't find Trump saying that. It was in the article

> “It’s a really serious investigation, and there are people that are going to go to jail,” Harry Litman, who used to work at the Department of Justice in the 1990s, told The Independent. “The whole atmosphere in the White House has to be paranoid.”
Generally speaking you're never going to gain mass on a cut. A complete beginner might but most people will not.
I wouldn't assume that they would try and push agendas in this possible case. They wouldn't be a freely elected government I don't think people would put up with much from them.
This is better when it's not in reverse.
Dude you're full of shit unless you have a source.
That's just... wow.

I didn't realize the audience was that old. Sorry but it's time for all of you baby boomers to die off. That generation has done more harm to this country than any other.
I spent time in Russia and the sentiment is definitely that you do not question or speak ill of Putin unless you want trouble.

The Dre episode was garbage. I almost didn't watch the others because of it but I'm glad that I did because they were much better.
But he hasn't heard of that either.
And they probably shouldn't get that feature. It could be abused greatly.
From my view doesn't look like this was the right choice in this situation but many times evading is better than trying to break on a motorcycle.
I've served a lot of famous people and not all of them tip very well.
Look here boys, this one's got traitor blood in him.
I'll support this once Florida becomes a blue State, I live there.
If so that will lead to injuries.
Let's be real, he's probably shittier than Hillary. Republicans just know how to win elections.
What was the joke?

Asshats deleted their comment.
Heavy weighted chin-ups.
Most gyms don't have farmers walk implements so dumbbells will work just fine. My gym has up to 100 lb dumbbells and I'm at 95 right now I'll probably move to the trap bar in a few weeks.
Pick up two heavy dumbbells and walk as far as you can. Sounds simple, and it is. But it's also one of the more intense exercises you can do. It works also every muscle, especially your traps, shoulders, grip, and even your core.  If you have problems with posture, heavy ass Farmers walks will fix it.
> , the best way to burn your excess fatty tissue stores is to get on an exercise bike and train up to 2 hours+ of riding at a 15-18 kph pace. 

Not true. HIIT cardio is the best way to burn fat. 

Sprints, the Prowler, and my favorite, Farmers walks are good examples. Steady state cardio is good a good aerobic activity, but not for fat burning. Aside from all of that, eating better and less is better way to lose fat than cardio of any kind.
I thought LeBron has said he's not taking any more pay cuts.
So is rural culture. 

Parts of every culture are trashy.

In my life, I found that many of the people who hold views of "it's always the other people, not me or my kind" haven't gone out and seen or experienced much of the world.
I bet this is projection at its finest.
Jacksonville is not a nice place.
Nah fam, a lot heat fans are still bitter.
I think it has more to do with class than anything else. This is how trashy people act. Not necessarily black white or Hispanic.
Sorry but you're wrong, the show does pay.

Yeah but I don't think he's played more than 60 games in any of the last three years. 

Those 40 to 60 games a year that he's healthy are great aren't they?
Spite?
Yes we are. The state legislature has just been dragging its feet.

They don't make them that small.
No one thinks he's going to retire, he's in the media because yesterday the Mavs opted out of his contract to sign him to a new two-year contract.

Couldn't the paper receipt output be hacked as well?
Doing barbell workouts puts a greater stress on your body so not only will you get stronger, but you'll get stronger faster and build a more balanced physique as well. Machines can be good for isolating muscles as an accessory only, but not as the main part of your workouts.
It's probably the same kind of guy you see using nothing but machines in the gym.
Yeah, what the other guy said. Join random pickup game. I go out by myself all the time and jump in games.
I've been up all night so not sure if this tweet is even real right now, it certainly doesn't feel like it should be.
Is Josh Smith still in the NBA?
Loved Vsauce before he started putting all of his content on YouTube Red.  I already have enough subscriptions, I don't feel like adding YouTube to the list.
If you don't have squat shoes I definitely recommend those. Maybe throw in some pause squats, just sit in the hole, get used to what it feels like.  Part of my warm-up is just sitting in the hole for about 10 seconds for maybe 3 or 4 reps just to get a really good stretch of all the muscles I'll be using.

One thing to remember is, that on the way up, once you break parallel you are more than likely going to finish the lift. This is a mental hurdle some people have when not going below parallel on the squat, they fear they won't be able to make it back up.  As long as you have the safety pins up to the right height should no fear of dumping a weight.
But if he's on the Lakers and they see first hand that he doesn't work hard, it's not a rumour.
That is not a 10-foot rim.

Sorry that this is petty, but I'm glad Dwight has had such a terrible career since he left Orlando.
I know right! It's so hard to just scroll right past it like It never existed!
Sorry in advance for busting your balls but... How could you not know?
This is a salary dump move to make room for a possible Paul George trade.
I'm sorry I just don't see the attraction to a girl giving blowjobs and handjobs to imaginary dicks and then flopping around like a fish out of water.
No, it's not still his house. Sorry Wade, you definitely made the wrong choice now you have to live with it.
Yeah but the infection had spread to Paris by the end of 28 Weeks Later.

Not impossible.
Exactly, I'm not sure why so many people see it as a misstep. He's doing exactly what Putin told him to do.
Gotta be a bot, I think most of that sub is bots. I refuse to believe that people are actually that deluded and deranged.
The context of super teams is free agents coming together. Like the Celtics, Heat, Cavs and Warriors.
I want to hear the tape. There are transcripts and direct quotes from the tape but no link to the tape? I don't want to fall into the same trap that many Trump supporters do by blindly believing anything put in front of me.
In the end, it's not about the money, he's a good guy and I won't turn him away because of that. At the bar I'm speaking of on a Friday night 4 bartenders will do anywhere between 1500 and 2000 and sales each, so it definitely wasn't about the money.
> Any friends come in, any regulars etc after last call, they know they get the same answer "Nope, I already did last call. See you tomorrow."

Yeah I'm going to turn down regulars or friends that are just going to hang out and bullshit while we finish up for the last 30 minutes and then tip us fat. 

We had a guy that would come in just after 2 when we kicked the kids out of the bar, order a Scotch,  drink his one drink drink and leave 20 on 10.
OP is talking about an hour after close, so it's more than reasonable to be a little annoyed. As a closing bartender I'm normally the last one to leave so if I finished all of my work it's time for the customers to leave as well.
Considering the stakes, who cares? 

Plus we did it that way for a couple hundred years.
I just can't fathom how **fucking** stupid he is.
> That's just overreacting, man.

If you really believe that you're going to be in for a rude awakening over the next few months.
Well, it's true, what do you expect?
And it's not like it was some kind of luck. They won the championship the year before and the year after, they were a great team.
The heat never confirm or deny player acquisition rumors so many teams use them as leverage. I wouldn't look too far into this just yet.
> And only one side of the political spectrum in the United States is being violent right now.

That's not true at all.
That's fine but I don't personally know any liberals that are overtly racist. Half of my family is from the south so I know plenty of conservative racists.

And what do you mean by slandering from the Democrats? Just asking for a specific example.
Trump supporters are the same people that were hanging Effigies of Obama over the years.  I think it's pretty reasonable for people to connect those dots, because let's be honest Donald Trump does have supporters that are racist. Is it necessarily right to call all Trump supporters racist? Of course not, but they're out there.
It's a tattoo, girls are doing it these days.
>  Cops are trained to take down people without killing them, why can't they do the same for dogs?


Because there's no place or a way you could reasonably shoot a dog without killing it. I'm genuinely surprised that you have to ask this question.
> At least republicans tend to not idolize their candidates as much and democrats.

I'm sorry but many of Trumps support him absolutely and blindly, they worship him. This isn't to say that many Hillary supporters aren't the same way but in my eyes it seems that they support him in an almost frightening way.
Good thing has a beard now
I honestly want no part of war or cold war again with Russia. After this mess we need to focus on fixing our problems here more than ever.
Yeah but it's a stupid, unfunny joke. Hence the downvotes.
Sorry dude but you're​ sounding kind of high-strung. First dates don't have to be awkward, no matter the situation. Just chill out, relax and enjoy meeting someone new. 

Plus... you'll never get a threesome out of that situation with that attitude.
It's irrelevant to us, the fans, it doesn't make one lick of difference other than it's just something to talk about.
To me it certainly looks like he was trying to pass the ball to Tristan Thompson then the passing lane got cut off so he passed it off the backboard. If he wanted he could have just shot it quite easily because he was wide open.
Sorry, couldn't pass it up.
because the outcomes are so dependent on the talent level of each team they couldn't achieve parity even if they wanted to in the NBA, which they don't, none of the owners or the players actually want parity. With free agency great players will always gravitate towards each other because everyone wants to win a ring and every single fan base would want their team to do the same thing the Warriors and the Cavaliers have done by stockpiling talent.
So KD shouldn't talk to LeBron like that? 

Got it.
Travel as much as you can and keep trying to learn new things. I feel like if you stagnate life gets repetitive and flies right by.
You misunderstand everyone in this thread. Diet is by far the biggest determining factor in weight gain and weight loss. You can work out until you're blue in the face but until you eat correctly you're not going to see results.  Hence 80/20. Ask any trainer or dietitian, or anyone that's been training a long time like myself and that's exactly what they'll tell you, that your diet is more important than what you do in the gym. Ever hear the phrase "abs are made in the kitchen"? Do you understand why? Because it's much easier to eat better than to do more exercise. I already lift 4  days a week and play basketball for 1, I consume about 3000 calories a day, and that is for maintenance alone. I shouldn't do any more exercise than I do right now because then I would not be able to recover enough to keep doing this much exercise. 

No one has said exercise isn't important as a matter of fact I have stated the opposite, that it is very important. But if you eat like shit you're going to feel like shit and you will probably look like shit.


Edit:

> I started cycling and lost 30lbs in a couple months without even thinking about diet. I run long distances 4-5 times a week and have 3-5 beers a day, eat two frozen pizzas in a sitting, and at least once a week eat a whole batch of cookies. My body fat never gets above 10%.
 
Haha, now I get it. This is something that almost every person that starts exercising goes through. You think that will work forever? Eventually you're going to go through any muscle mass you have left and your metabolism will slow to a crawl and with that diet you will plateau or recede. My guess is that you're much younger than I, I'm 37 now and grew up quite skinny, but have always been in shape. Father Time catches up to us all and eventually you'll have to change.
Thanks.
> the self indulgent egotistical woman

This is why your judgemental prick. Making judgments about someone from a picture? Get off your high horse.
Yeah because the college 3-point line is too short, many players have a hard time adjusting to the difference.
How long have you been watching the NBA? I'm honestly just curious.
Honestly I think it's because most of those people are new fans or casual fans and don't really understand the NBA. Plus, people are stupid yo.
The dog doesn't look to be in any discomfort or pain. I will say you do seem like a judgemental prick though.
Is this recent? Because it kind of seems like it flies in the face of everything I have been told in my life. Got a source?
Do you mean Parkour?
Hope she doesn't go the fake route like Megan Fox.
Then why is it that getting lean is always about 80% diet 20% exercise?  I am currently on my way to 10% body fat after a bulk, now that I really zeroed in my diet the pounds are shedding quite easily and I'm not doing any more lifting than I already was. The physiological effects of eating correctly produce greater effects than just doing more exercise.
I'm from Florida, nothing Rubio can do will make me a fan of his, even disavowing Trump.
I think it should be understood that the president cannot use executive privilege when being investigated for a crime. Is extremely important for the president to not be able to stop investigation into himself whether he be guilty or not.
That's cool and all, but current scientific literature says otherwise.
While this is true, exercising regularly is full of other benefits that will help you lead an overall healthy lifestyle. The main ingredient in losing weight is always going to be calories in vs. calories out.
Facts make sense.
Exercise isn't the end-all-be-all of weight loss of course, and I don't know your circumstances but I highly recommend starting an exercise program if you want to get the most benefit out of your new lifestyle.
> but too many just make that claim to make them self feel better about lack of effort.

It's a common defense mechanism when people can't bring themselves to make a change, they make excuses instead.
No one had a problem with that? 

You smoking rocks man?

Go away Morty
We used to do this all the time when we were kids. Only, as I got bigger I started actually hitting the ground because I started to weigh too much so I stopped doing it. We are also jumping from 15 or 20 ft. Basically the very apex of the roof at times.


Plus you go ass first from that, height not face first.

I'm no Warriors fan. But I can read the writing on the wall and it says the Warriors are going to kick the Cavs ass.
This comment makes no sense.
Yeah, I totally understand why they got rid of a niche sport and added one that has hundreds of millions of fans across the globe.
I'm hijacking the top comment to point out that it wasn't actually Rihanna that yelled brick, but the woman next to her. There's video out there but I don't have time to find it for you, sorry.

For many years I was a staunch supporter of the death penalty and I would say over the last five I have gone to the other side completely. 

The simple fact is that we know that we have executed innocent people and that fact alone has made me change my position.
Dude come on, Reagan was the oldest sitting president. 

And it's going to stay that way because Trump is not getting reelected.

The main movers in the squat are the quads, not glutes. She should do things like barbell hip thrust, Romanian deadlifts, walking lunges many other things are way better at focusing on the glutes than the squat. The squat is a great exercise, but not really for the glutes.
Maybe you should take some time to figure out what you're talking about before you open your mouth and speak.
God damn full retard.
Doesn't matter, you're still spending all your time on Reddit complaining about reposts you fucking loser.
Not everyone spends everyday eating Cool Ranch Doritos on Reddit so they see **every fucking post**. You are the worst kind of redditor.

> I know this does not speak for all women or men that have work done
> The first thing on the to-do list is get rid of EC and replace it with a popular vote 

Why move from one flawed system to another one that is just as flawed? I'm a liberal and I know that the popular vote will be far better for us but not as fair for everyone else.

 Ranked voting is by far the best to fix our voting woes.
It's not an act. I really find implants unattractive, more so because the girls that I have messed around with that have had work done are incredibly insecure and impossible for me to deal with. So now, honestly, I just don't pursue those girls.  I know this does not speak for all women or men that have work done,  but for me personally plastic surgery is a turn off because to me it signals that someone is not confident and comfortable in their own skin.
I think a lot of people think it was JFK because of the speech he gave concerning going to the Moon.
I wish people would get this idea of their head, it's stupid. There  are far better ways than the national popular vote and the Electoral College.
