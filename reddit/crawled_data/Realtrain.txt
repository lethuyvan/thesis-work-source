Good question! I had to do some research.

So let's say someone serves for 6 years. 

Depending on how often you have sex, Viagra would cost about $500 per month. That's $**36,000** over six years. 

Vaginoplasty (penis to vagina surgery) averages about $5400. So lets double that to include various other medical bills to about $**11,000**.

I'm not saying Facebook shouldn't be liable. Facebook Inc., and the people running the operation (Zuck, Board of Directors, etc.) should be held fully responsible.

Shareholders (such as myself) that have no control in the companies procedures shouldn't be jailed for Management's wrongdoings. They can lose all the value of their stock, but that's about all. Many many people have nonvoting Facebook and Google shares in their portfolios either as retirement, or investments. It would be wrong (and illegal) to punish them for that.
Many middle class Americans own facebook shares. The entire purpose of incorporating is so shareholders don't have to be liable for the company damages. Often it's right in the name "Limited Liability Company."

Plus most of that stock does not hold voting power, so they have absolutely no say in the company at all. 

*Administration* of the company should absolutely be held liable.

It's fairly common actually. Even though this shares don't have voting rights, they still have other shareholders rights. 

Many people don't buy shares to take control anyway, they just buy them to make profit. 
Even though it's non-voting you still have other shareholders rights. There are a lot of companies that do tiered shares.

Lion King is a close second to Aladdin.

My problem is that Scar isn't quite as good a villain as other Disney movies. At first he's excellent (the Be Prepared scene still gives me chills), but then just kind of walks in and becomes whiny.

Honest question.
SCOTUS has also ruled that the 2nd amendment's protections are not unlimited, and that regulation is permitted on certain types of weapons.  
Those are all limted in their own, reasonable ways.

Yeah, but this is America remember.

For instance, we have the right to travel between states freely. But for some types of travel (car, plane) we need an ID.

We've touched upon annuities. Essentially he said an annuity would be calculated by using the yearly payment function of our calculators. 
Ok, so I've set the present value to be -200,000, the years to 10, and the yearly payments to 24,000.

That puts the future value at 40,000. Is it really that simple?
I'm still confused though. If there's no interest rate, how can I calculate it?

Essentially all we've learned so far is to use the functions on our HP 10bII+ to compute Present Value, Future Value, Payments, Interest, or Time. I just don't understand how this problem fits into that.

Last year the S6 got the update around March/April.
It almost certainly will. 
If they just got rid of the ugly gradients they would look pretty good.
The National Geographic collection at my University library goes back to the 1800s! It's so fascinating to look at!
>Musk has described himself as "nauseatingly pro-American". According to Musk, the United States is "[inarguably] the greatest country that has ever existed on Earth", describing it as "the greatest force for good of any country that's ever been." Musk believes outright that there "would not be democracy in the world if not for the United States", arguing there were "three separate occasions in the 20th-century where democracy would have fallen with World War I, World War II and the Cold War, if not for the United States." Musk also stated that he thinks "it would be a mistake to say the United States is perfect, it certainly is not. There have been many foolish things the United States has done and bad things the United States has done."

From Wikipedia. He's also a US citizen.

I would *love* if they brought Southwest. The airport has a few million dollars of renovations/expansions planned. Hopefully they can get a few more airlines in.
Apparently they're looking to get direct flights to Paris though.
Thanks! I always struggle to get the heat just right. 
No clue.

>Next time you get invited to speak at a conference, especially if you're a black female -- ask the organizer to confirm you're the only black female on the panel/in the speaker lineup. If not, say you are honored, but must decline, and give the reason. And because you are at Google, guess what -- they're going to change the panel for you. You'll feel bad about inconveniencing them. But no that bad. When the cheese black female executive is in the 'green room' and glaring about you because she was bounced from the panel in favor of a man on her team, you'll feel pretty damn smug. Or you won't: you'll feel bad that you might have put him in a touch spot, and you'll go above and beyond to make good with the schmucky senior chick. (I know this is nuanced. I know it's a burden to be a man and have to do these speeches, to be the poster child for diversity in tech. But on balance I'd rather have the conference organizer try, and try harder, than not try at all.)

Honestly, I'm thinking the best course would be to develope another service.

1. It fits the Google rule of 2 of everything.

2. Keep is extremely good at what it does. I'd hate to see it bogged down.

3. It would probably be easier to develope this service from scratch that trying to adapt Keep.
Lightning was released before USB C was a thing. I'm willing to bet a good part of the reason apple hasn't changed is because of how much backlash there was when they switched to lightning.

And regarding the mouse, they paid Xerox in stock to be able to look at/develop their tech. It was a fair deal.
Yes from what we can tell Apple was key in the physical port design. They filed several patents during the development process that show similar designs. Also, Apple was the first company to announce a device that used it, followed a couple hours later by Google. 
They don't think that way though. In their minds, they think the child is choosing this (maybe with influence from the devil) and that they're trying to save them. 

In their eyes, they're doing the child a favor.
They literally helped develope the standard. They also were one of the first to include it on their laptops, and have recently been selling computers with *only* usb C.
They worked on the USB C standard, so I wouldn't be surprised if they jumped in here too.
No. I mean something that can properly compete with OneNote and Evernote.
Hopefully this means Google will be developing a first party note taking app for Google drive. 
USB C is bigger than micro USB
It's really magical. As buttery smooth as the iPad pro. I've become spoiled, I can't use any slower app.
I wish Google would bake stylus support into their office suite. Squid is an excellent 3rd party solution for my Chromebook, but I'd *love* to have a notive program in Google Drive.
There's always some teenager who'll be happy to spend money on an old civic. That car easily has another 50k left in it, perfect for a new driver.
Nice! Those things last forever. Unbelievable how well they hold up.
Fairly old, 1998. It had 175,000 miles when I got it, now it's up to about 210,000.

I've had to replace a few areas of the exhaust due to rust (fortunately not the cat), but nothing too bad. Other than that, just basic maintenance, plugs and wires, new rotor recently, a couple light bulbs. Engine still runs beautifully. 
Can confirm, bought a Honda Civic for $500 4 years ago and it's still going strong. 
Or they should have dumped a few million more into researching in-screen scanners. Vivo has an OK implementation, and if there's anything Apple is great at it's turning the OK into the AMAZING. 
Better yet, besides 3D facial tracking, what can a $1000 iPhone-X do that a $700 iPhone 8 can't?

Apple's biggest problem was releasing the two phones together. Apple has a history of telling their customers what they have to have, and to be honest it usually works. By giving them this choice, they're definitely hurting adoption of the iPhone X.
Something something blue dots
It should be a standard that any phone can use.

It came with Samsung ArtCanvas. ChromeOS is going to be basically identical whichever device you use, it's not like Android.  I'm surprised there was even that one Samsung App on it. 

I take notes using Squid. It has incredibly smooth writing, rivaling the iPad pro. It does not automatically turn handwriting to text, but that's just my preference. Nebo is also highly recommended, and it does what you were saying. 

Of course you can also download just about anything from the Google Play Store.
I got a tempered glass protector from Spigen. No complaints at all.

Hinges are tight with no problems. I've heard a few people have had to adjust some screws, but it's pretty painless. I've had no issues. 

I don't have a case on the device. Personally I think it would ruin the aesthetics. . I do have a shockproof holder that I keep in my backpack that the laptop goes in.

Speakers are maybe slightly below average for this class. I mean, they work, but they're a bit tinny and not too loud.
I wouldn't mind being publicly known. If I were extravagantly wealthy, I'd hopefully be doing enough good to be noticed.
They literally invented Ethernet. Absolutely incredible work come out of there. 
Yeah, the Plus and Pro are basically identical, the only differences being the processor and color.  I bought mine on Swappa for about $300 last year. THe build quality is very good. (Not quite on par with my ThinkPad, but not bad at all.) The keyboard is *ok*. Again, it's not bad, but not as great as other laptops out there (like ThinkPads). 

 Besides a headphone jack and microSD slot, it only has two USB-C ports -- one on each side. Both can be used for charging. I bought a little USB C hub off Amazon for the rare occasion that I need another port. It provides HDMI, Ethernet, and a few standard USB ports. Ethernet and HDMI work fine with the laptop. 

I have a screen protector just to be safe. It was only a few bucks on Amazon and it just gives me peace of mind.

Samsung uses the exact same technology in the Note phones and on these laptops, so you can use your S Pen with the chromebook, and vice versa! The only difference is there is no button on the Chromebook's stylus. 
I have the Chromebook Plus (the little brother of the Pro) and I absolutely love it. 

The selling point for me was the stylus. I've handwritten all my notes digitally this year and it's worked wonderful. Plus the screen is beautiful and battery life is terrific.

Let me know if you have any questions!

They don't block reddit. Actually, come to think of it, I don't think any sites are blocked.
Fortunately most websites I use 2FA with like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, have the ability to remember devices.
It's an older article, but I just learned about it and thought it was interesting. It's nice to see at least one public school around here embracing technology. 
No. 2FA stops some random person from logging into my account if they somehow figure out my password.

If someone is breaking into my office and accessing my computer, I have bigger problems to worry about.

Your defense was that "if there isn't a law, it must be an opinion."

I just refuted that.
There's no law saying that New Zealand is a set of islands off Australia. That doesn't mean that someone can have an opinion that it's a part of mainland Africa. 
That's not how opinions work.
An opinion cannot be "wrong"
