the bike home for lunch is rather exhilarating when oversized truck make right turns from the left lane, without turn signals.  at least do it when the light is green maybe?
finally decided on a new name for kitty! sassafras :)
sassafras has the sniffles :(
is so glad that the fire alarm will save us from excess water vapor. . . from the dryer.  grrr.
from my vet school app, hours i have spent working & volunteering with animals and veterinarians: 3690
marathon on the square at 10pm for happy hour?
kitty thinks my leg is fun to climb up.  ow.  but it's hard to be mad when the purpose of the climb is to snuggle with me :)
is kinda glad my front brake is now functional, otherwise i would likely have been squashed by a little yellow car today.
just got a kitten!!!  any name ideas for the itty bitty kitty?
mmmm. . . cannibalism day in my dead ppl class :)
