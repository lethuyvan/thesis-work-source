it's pretty amazing how many hours are required to organize a presentation that is going to last no more than twenty minutes. this would be so much simpler if i could just call haydn as a witness.
i finally went grocery shopping. picked up a small piece of raclette, not knowing what it was, because i wanted something to put on crackers. turns out it is supposed to be melted over a flame or special grill and then immediately scraped onto some kind of bread. whyyyy did i get such a difficult cheese? will just putting it right on a pan or toasting it somehow work? i guess we'll see!
streeterville? wrigleyville? printer's row? what is this

i just dreamed the mob kidnapped me and was forcing me to host a toothpaste infomercial. the draw for the toothpaste is that it was used by athletes in the olympics. i kept getting all the names and locations wrong because nobody told me what they were. a burly guy in a suit was getting pretty upset cause we were stopping so much. he was on the roof for some reason. the set looked suspiciously like my backyard. huh.
cooked with shiitake mushrooms for the first time today. they're so smelly!
