ran 19 miles today. shower, a big glass of water, and then cleaning up the house.
is elated!
caught fireflies in a jar, am going to soak my feet in some piping hot water, and is just relaxing to chopin and a good book.
back to my modified russian tuning. it sounds so much more full.
why is it that everyone else's musical tastes go forward and mine seem to switchback?
$500.00 for stitches?!
is extremely bored. late night run to north and back.
