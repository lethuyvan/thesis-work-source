is drowning in a sea of irrelevance.
today has been rewinding the look speaker *propname* gave to rep. *propname* last night and has checked back into leviathan by hobbes "the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short".

s love for lindsay lohan is just like an investor's commitment to a high performing mutual fund...he's in it for the long-term.

recently found a present from his best friends @*propname*, @*propname* and @*propname*. contained in the envelope mailed from their lovely home on munson road, which had a bathroom right out the movie "trainspotting", were several mini-size wired hangers. so sweet of them, so mommy fu#$%# dearest of them..

is glad that he caught a bit of "*propname*'s drag race" last night.  *propname* stepped it up a notch with the show setting and hair//makeup.  the competition is fiercer than ever...it reminds him of the transition "america's next top model" from cycle 1 to cycle 2.  he's feelin "totes reality" right now.
