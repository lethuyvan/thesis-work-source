if you can't walk in heels take a taxi... coco chanel
i haven't opened the blinds yet but from the sound of the wind and the rain i think that the world may be about to end...
is bloody freezing....
thanks everyone for all the texts etc...  finally feeling human again!  i don't think i've ever been so sick.  went out for the first time in 12 days this morning! talk about cabin fever...  back to work on wednesday - am even looking forward to it!
