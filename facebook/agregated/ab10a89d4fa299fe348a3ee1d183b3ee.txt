i was totally freaked out tonight while driving home with janice at 12am. the black coupe next to me matched my speed even though i was going fast and then he continued to match me speed as i slowed down. so i turn to look at the driver of the car and he's wearing a mask. a rubber mask reminiscent to freddy cruger. 0_0 i almost had a heart attack. i then slowed down a lot and he continued on... oh my goodness...
in my 10 min stop at 85*c bakery in irvine, i saw 4 people i knew...
then at costco tonight, i find out my atm card is blocked due to potential fraud. now i need to stop by the bank tomorrow for a temporary card... i wonder if this qualifies for fml...
quite possibly the worst couple days ever: yesterday almost cried at work. i apparently have the 2 worst classes in the school- lowest freshman math. who i see for four periods.  and which stole a student's wallet.
