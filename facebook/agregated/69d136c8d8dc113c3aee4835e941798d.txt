is wondering what the fuck x-factor is coming to. i mean, *propname* beating *propname*? what is this crap
is jammin on dj hero with *propname*
did you know that it couldn't be more blatent that the x-factor was fixed unless *propname* openly admitted he was gay with *propname* and *propname*
thinks it would be quite amusing to see *propname* get number 1 with the original version of the climb.
