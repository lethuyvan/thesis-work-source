preparing for tryouts and the start of steelers season . . . its that time of year again!
yea cchs jv - starting off the season with a win!
lazy day around the house after the family has left.
cchs jv - you girls rock!  what else can i say?  and mega shout-out to *propname* for moral support  tonight and rockin' programs.
back at it
at work on a sunday - but at least the steelers won last night!
jenna's wedding
here we go, steelers, here we go!
anyone in the pitttsburgh area able to work the polls on tuesday?  i've got a friend that needs help.  let me know.  thanks.
steelers, steelers, steelers
i have the best boyfriend ever.  thanks babe, i love you!
working at home, wathcing the *propname* game, and watching the snow.  the words "lazy saturday" come to mind.
and yes, i misspelled "watching" not once, but twice.
wow, that was a great game - even if *propname* did lose. hope the 1 v. 2 game tonight is that good.
really?  two days in a row?  i would like to take back my comment about de ja vu - i didn't mean i wanted it to end like that (again).
absence sharpens love, presence stregthens it
it'a kinda like de ja vu - working at home, wathcing the *propname* (steelers) game, and snow is still on the ground.  good thing i know its sunday!
put this as your status if you or somebody you know has suffered the loss of a baby ? the majority won't put it on because unlike cancer. baby loss is a taboo... break the silence ? this is in memory of all the angel babies...gone too soon but never forgotten about!!? show your support and let these women know they don't have to grieve alone.
if you & i woke up in jail together...using only four words...what would you say to me? copy and paste this in your status and see what funny things your friends say....(and if you make a comment, you gotta put this in your status. fair is fair.)
if i ruled the world . . . imagine that . . .
how does that kind of fallen even happen that quickly?
steelers, steelers, steelers!
