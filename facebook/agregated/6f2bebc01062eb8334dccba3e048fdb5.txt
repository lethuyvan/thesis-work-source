Òspeed is not part of the true way of strategy. speed implies that things seem fast or slow, according to whether or not they are in rhythm. whatever the way, the master of strategy does not appear fastÉ.of course, slowness is bad. really skillful people never get out of time, and are always deliberate, and never appear busy.Ó  *propname*

good times in the mountains. now i return to do battle with the nefarious arch-villain monday
your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. and most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. they somehow already know what you truly want to become. everything else is secondary.Ó steve jobs

most of our platitudes notwithstanding, self-deception remains the most difficult deception. the tricks that worked on others count for nothing in that very well-lit back alley where one keeps assignations with oneself: no winning smiles will do here, no prettily drawn list of good intentions. - *propname*
