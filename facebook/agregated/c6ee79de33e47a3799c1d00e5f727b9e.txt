just remembered, i seen a naked guy running up the supports on the squinty bridge last night with all hanging out .. but wearing socks. not a pretty sight.
seen a leaflet guy coming into building. so i collected together all the leaflets we have (about 15-20) and when he went to post the leaflets i posted them all outwards as he opened the letterbox. he looked a little confused and tried to push them back, so i posted them back out again. ahh its fun to piss off people.
feeling like crap, no temperature though so at least its not swine flu (at least i think its not!)
got a pair of degu's last night, already causing issues! they are uber cute though.
got a refferal to a ent specialist so i can get a camera jammed up my nose into my sinuses. not pretty but at least i may be able to finally get rid of this damn sinus infection! :d

gotta love 3 mobile. i asked to cancel my contract and was asked "could we convince you to stay" i replied with "due to the terrible customer service, i would rather die a slow and horribly painful death than stay" to which i got "do you have any friends or relatives you would like to refer so they can get a good deal". i want that csr to work in my company retention department!!

whilst i may not understand the history behind thanksgiving, i can get behind any holiday that consists of a huge amount of food, alcohol and friends. happy thanksgiving to my american friends. and to anyone else, today is just an excuse for us to take part in "cultural diversity" and get drunk and stuffed with lots of food.

i can handle the scope thing being shoved up my nose and down my throat, i can handle the ct scan, but having blood taken, still can't deal with that!
