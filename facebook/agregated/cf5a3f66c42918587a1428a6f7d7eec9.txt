[13 hours in vcpa today... it's going to be a long day..!]
[. . . dammit! just remembered that i still have stuff to finish for work . . . & how did it get to be 2am?? . . .]
"we go out in stormy weather á we rarely practice discern á we make love to some with sin á we seek out the taciturn á and that's the way we get by á the way we get by..."
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh..!
~[no response is a response... & as far as i'm concerned, it's the very worst one you could give someone...*sigh* oh well tho]~
[...so f@#$% happy right now..!!! never saw that coming, not in a million years...] :d  ;p  :)
~[booooooo..!]~
...[well i may have screwed up~yet again~but the nice people who keep watching my crash & burn routine (one semester after another) have apparently not lost patience or given up on me quite yet...]     ~i am truly grateful~
[...]
[...well, it may not have been pretty (for the most part), but at least it's over!...] goodbye, fall semester '09 ~ you kicked my ass  :|
~ [...my phone is being lame today...] ~
ready to not be freezing my a*s off in the vcpa lobby any more for today! ashley, i hope you bring a sweatshirt..!
guys who claim to like me, present & future:  [...quit telling me what you think i want to hear (especially if you have no intention of backing it up ~consistently~ through your actions)... & just start telling me how it truly is, dammit..! if in reality it's not enough, i have a right to know that, & you have no right to claim otherwise.]
.........................why can't i focus on writing my paper at all??...........................
[people should just stick to treating eachother the way that they really feel about one another, even if that means giving up whatever they might gain from pretending to like someone they really don't, or having to deal with the temporary awkwardness of admitting that they made a mistake, or changed their mind... or whatever. just a thought.]
finally almost done in the vcpa! 54hrs since wednesday is enough!

hahaha ~ love this!: "please put this on your status if you know someone (or are related to someone) who has been eaten by dragons. my wish for 2010 is that people will understand, that being eaten by dragons is not something to be ashamed of. dragons are nearly unstoppable and are truly terrifying. 93% won't copy and paste this... they have been eaten by dragons."
"miss anna, you must remember, you have been a very difficult woman ~ much more difficult than is generality."  ~ the king (from the king & i)   i love this movie..! [normally can't stand musicals, too...]
