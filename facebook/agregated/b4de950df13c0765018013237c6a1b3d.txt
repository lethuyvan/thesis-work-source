laundry, then packing, then maybe sleeping....ahhhh... england tomorrow!
is sorry if she did not reply to text messages or phone calls. her iphone is dumb :( and had decided it doesn't want the touch screen to work...
is back in the us.
me "will you x me?" *propname* "no. i don't do things like that."
thinks she should throw more clothes away so she will be forced to do laundry more...
