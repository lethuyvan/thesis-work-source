is a stanford graduate and leaves for beijing tomorrow.
found red bean paste in her chocolate croissant this morning, and reluctantly switched her inner monologue from french back to chinese.
struggles to say that she's taking a class on "networking" with a straight face.
is energized by super last minute flights, and very grateful to *propname*'s mother.
is enchanted by this website (http:////www.inbflat.net//), even if her chinese internet can't load fast enough to properly display the videos.
got six pairs of shoes for christmas.  it might officially be time for her to stop wearing her much loved cirque du soleil flip-flops.
just finished a christopher lin-induced snes binge.  donkey kong country: complete.  aladdin: lamentably ongoing.  there's a party here in agrabah, if you care to revitalize her arabian efforts.
