# Thesis Course Works

Source code and various data that I used during my Master Thesis work

Most of the programs are written in Python and I used a docker image to run my
program, this makes it more portable

You can build the image using Dockerfile from `docker_image` directory

## LIWC results

Within the 2 datasets, I use LIWC as features for neural network.

There **should** be a `van_liwc_result.txt` file in `facebook/aggregated_result`
and another `van_liwc_result.txt`
